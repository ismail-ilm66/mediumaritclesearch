Our aim is to highlight the learning topics and technologies with the highest potential job ROI. What are people using in the workforce? What do the trends look like? We’re not attempting to pick what’s best, but instead using a data-driven approach to help you focus on what might actually help you land a job when the interviewer asks you, “do you know __(fill in the blank)__?” We’re not going to look at which ones are the fastest, or which ones have the best code quality. We’ll assume they’re all speed demons and they’re all good enough to get the job done. The focus is on one thing: What’s actually being used at scale? The big question we’ll look at is the current state of component frameworks, and we’re going to focus primarily on the big three: React, Angular, and Vue.js, primarily because they have all broken far ahead of the rest of the pack in terms of workplace adoption. Last year I noted how fast Vue.js was growing and mentioned it might catch Angular in 2018. That didn’t happen, but it’s still growing very quickly. I also predicted it would have a much harder time converting React users because React has a much stronger user satisfaction rate than Angular — React users simply don’t have a compelling reason to switch. That played out as expected in 2018. React kept a firm grip on its lead in 2018. Interestingly, all three frameworks are still growing exponentially, year over year. React still has much higher satisfaction ratings than Angular for the third year we’ve been tracking it, and it’s not giving up any ground to challengers. I don’t currently see anything that could challenge it in 2019. Unless something crazy big comes along and disrupts it, React will be the framework to beat again at the end of 2019. Speaking of React, it just keeps getting better. The new React hooks API replaced the class API I’ve been merely tolerating since React 0.14. (The class API still works, but the hooks API is really much better). React’s great API improvements, like better support for code splitting and concurrent rendering (see details), are going to make it really hard to beat in 2019. React is now without a doubt, the most developer friendly front-end framework in the space. I couldn’t recommend it more. We’ll look at a handful of key pieces of data to gauge interest and use in the industry: React overtook Angular in the search trends in January 2018, and held its lead through the end of the year. Vue.js now holds a visible position on the graph, but still small factor in the search trends. For comparison: last year’s graph: Package downloads give us a fair indication of what’s actually being used, because developers frequently download the packages they need while they’re working. Overly-clever readers will note that sometimes they download these things from their internal corporate package repos, to which I answer, “why yes, that does happen — to all three frameworks.” All of them have established a foothold in the enterprise, and I’m confident in the averaging power of this data at scale. React Monthly Downloads: 2014–2018 Angular Monthly Downloads: 2014–2018 Vue Monthly Downloads: 2014–2018 Let’s look at a quick visual comparison of the share of downloads: “But you’re forgetting all about Angular 1.0! It’s still huge in the enterprise.” No, I’m not. Angular 1.0 is still used a lot in the enterprise in the same way that Windows XP is still used a lot in the enterprise. It’s definitely out there in enough numbers to notice, but the new versions have long since dwarfed it to the point that it’s now less significant than the other frameworks. Why? Because the software industry at large, and over-all use of JavaScript across all sectors (including the enterprise) is growing so fast that new installs quickly dwarf old installs, even if the legacy apps never upgrade. For evidence, just take another look at those download charts. More downloads in 2018 than in the previous years combined. Indeed.com aggregates job postings from a variety of job boards. Every year, we tally the job postings¹ mentioning each framework to give you a better idea of what people are hiring for. Here’s what it looks like this year: Again, a lot more total jobs this year than the previous year. I dropped Ember because it’s clearly not growing at the rate that everything else is. I wouldn’t recommend learning it to prepare for a future job placement. jQuery and Ember jobs didn’t change much, but everything else grew a lot. Thankfully, the number of new people joining the software engineering field has grown a lot as well in 2018, but we need to continue to hire and train junior developers (meaning we need qualified senior developers to mentor them), or we won’t keep pace with the explosive job growth. For comparison, here’s last year’s chart: Average salary climbed again in 2018, from $110k/year to $111k/year. Anecdotally, the salary listings are lagging new hire expectations, and hiring managers will struggle to hire and retain developers if they don’t adjust for the developer’s market and offer larger pay increases. Retention and poaching continues to be a huge problem in 2018 as employees jump ship for higher paying jobs, elsewhere. I say it every year: Focus on the fundamentals. This year you’re getting some extra help. All software development is composition: The act of breaking down complex problems into smaller problems, and composing solutions to those smaller problems to form your application. But when I ask JavaScript interviewees the most fundamental questions in software engineering, “what is function composition?” and “what is object composition?” they almost invariably can’t answer the questions, even though they do them every day. I have long thought this was a very serious problem that needs to be addressed, so I wrote a book on the topic: “Composing Software”. If you learn nothing else in 2019, learn how to compose software well. TypeScript continued to grow in 2018, and it continues to be overrated because type safety does not appear to be a real thing (does not appear to reduce production bug density by much), and type inference in JavaScript without TypeScript’s help is really quite good. You can even use the TypeScript engine to get type inference in normal JavaScript using Visual Studio Code. Or install the Tern.js plugins for your favorite editor. TypeScript continues to fall flat on its face for most higher order functions. Maybe I just don’t know how to use it correctly (after years living with it on a regular basis — in which case, they really need to improve usability, documentation, or both), but I still don’t know how to properly type the map operation in TypeScript, and it seems to be oblivious to anything going on in a transducer. It fails to catch errors, and frequently complains about errors that aren’t really errors at all. It just isn’t flexible or full featured enough to support how I think about software. But I’m still holding out hope that one day it will add the features we need, because as much as its shortcomings frustrate me while trying to use it for real projects, I also love the potential of being able to properly (and selectively) type things when it’s really useful. My current rating: Very cool in very select, restricted use-cases, but overrated, clumsy, and very low ROI for large production apps. Which is ironic, because TypeScript bills itself as “JavaScript that scales”. Perhaps they should add a word: “JavaScript that scales awkwardly.” What we need for JavaScript is a type system modeled more after Haskell’s, and less after Java’s. Last year I predicted that blockchain and fin-tech would be big technologies to watch in 2018. That prediction was spot on. One of the major themes of 2017–2018 was the rise of crypto and building the foundations of the internet of value. Remember that phrase. You’re going to hear it a lot, soon. If you’re like me and you’ve been following decentralized apps since the P2P explosion, this has been a long time coming. Now that Bitcoin lit the fuse and showed how decentralized apps can be self-sustaining using cryptocurrencies, the explosion is unstoppable. Bitcoin has grown several orders of magnitude in just a few years. You may have heard that 2018 was a “crypto winter”, and got the idea that the crypto industry is in some sort of trouble. That’s complete nonsense. What really happened was at the end of 2017, Bitcoin hit another 10x multiple in an epic exponential growth curve, and the market pulled back a bit, which happens every time the Bitcoin market cap grows another 10x. In this chart, each arrow starts at another 10x point, and points to the low point on the price correction. Fundraising for crypto ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) peaked in early 2018, and the 2017–2018 funding bubble brought a rush of new job openings into the ecosystem, peaking at over 10k open jobs in January 2018. It has since settled back to about 2,400 (according to Indeed.com), but we’re still very early and this party is just getting started. There is a lot more to say about the burgeoning crypto industry, but that’s a whole other blog post. If you’re interested, read “Blockchain Platforms and Tech to Watch in 2019”. As predicted last year, these technologies continued to explode in 2018: AI/Machine Learning is in full swing with 30k open jobs at the close of 2018, deep fakes, incredible generative art, amazing video editing capabilities from the research teams at companies like Adobe — there has never been a more exciting time to explore AI. Progressive Web Applications are quickly just becoming how modern web apps are properly built — added features and support from Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. It’s incredible how quickly I’m taking the PWAs on my phone for granted. For example, I don’t have the Twitter Android app installed on my phone anymore. I exclusively use the Twitter PWA instead. AR (Augmented Reality) VR (Virtual Reality) MR (Mixed Reality) all got together and joined forces like Voltron to become XR (eXtended Realty). The future of full-time XR immersion is coming. I’m predicting within 5–10 years for mass adoption of consumer XR glasses. Contact lenses within 20. Thousands of new jobs opened up in 2018, and this industry will continue to explode in 2019. Robotics, Drones, and Autonomous Vehicles Autonomous flying drones are already here, autonomous robots continue to improve, and more autonomous vehicles are sharing the road with us at the end of 2018. These technologies will continue to grow and reshape the world around us through 2019 and into the next 20 years. Quantum Computing progressed admirably in 2018, as predicted, and as predicted, it did not go mainstream, yet. In fact, my prediction, “it may be 2019 or later before the disruption really starts” was likely very optimistic. Researchers in the crypto space have paid extra attention to quantum-safe encryption algorithms (quantum computing will invalidate lots of today’s assumptions about what is expensive to compute, and crypto relies on things being expensive to compute), but in spite of a constant flood of interesting research progress in 2018, a recent report puts things into perspective: “Quantum computing has been on Gartner’s hype list 11 times between 2000 and 2017, each time listed in the earliest stage of the hype cycle and each time said to be more than a decade away.” This reminds me of early AI efforts, which began to heat up in the 1950’s, had limited but interesting success in the 1980’s and 1990’s, but only just started getting really mind-blowing circa 2010.

Load Testing Using Apache JMeter,Written by Mitesh," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Mitesh Follow ITNEXT -- 1 Listen Share Load testing is the process of putting the load through (HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket etc) calls on any software system to determine its behavior under normal and high load conditions. Load test helps identify maximum requests a software system can handle. It helps determine the point of a bottleneck due to which application starts degrading performance. Load testing is effective when we simulate real user scenario. We need to know how our users behave on our application. Try to replicate their behavior using different API calls and generate load through many concurrent requests at our application for an extended period of time to understand application behavior changes. When we generate load on the system beyond normal usage (high load) to understand application/system behavior, we call it stress testing. Stress testing is done to know the limits of an overall system, understand kind of errors thrown during such load and how the end user is affected. This helps in planning for events when a much higher load is expected by provisioning more infrastructure or optimizing applications. We can use Apache JMeter for load testing static as well as dynamic resources which can generate concurrent users to simulate real user scenario. It also provides graphical analyses of test reports. It is written in Java, so we need to have java runtime installed to run Jmeter. As per JMeter website, it is defined as mentioned below : The Apache JMeter™ application is open source software, a 100% pure Java application designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance. It was originally designed for testing Web Applications but has since expanded to other test functions. Install JMeter on your system from where you want to run your test. I am using Mac OS for running Jmeter and using brew to install JMeter. We first need to check file descriptors we can open on our system using below command. Every OS has limits on active file descriptors. Every TCP connection takes a file descriptor, so we need to make sure we have enough file descriptor (can set between 1–65535) to run concurrent requests. To start our load test, we need to start with thread groups. They are the beginning point of any test plan. We can specify the number of users (= number of threads) that we want to simulate concurrently. Set ramp-up time which specifies the amount of time it takes to start all threads. We need to define a number of iterations for each user(thread) in the group. Each thread executes the plan independently from other threads. All elements inside single thread will execute sequentially. We can add samplers and logic controllers in a thread group. Samplers help send a request to a server and wait for response i.e. HTTP request sampler to send HTTP request and get the response. Logic controllers help customize the logic to decide when to send a request, modify request etc. Listeners are another type of element which we can add in a thread group. They provide access to information about our load test. Graph result listener helps plot results of our test. View result tree listener shows the detail of request and response. We can add pre-processor and post-processor to a sampler request. Pre-processor executes defined action before sample request and post-processor executes defined action after sample request. Pre-processor can be used to generate dynamic parameters different for each request and post-processor to fetch response parameters to be used by other requests. Config elements are used to configure default value for the samplers. Let’s take a real world example where we are going to create a JMeter test plan with a thread group which can run CRUD operations on user resource at a given server. Each “create user” operation needs to have different email address randomly generated before sending the request. Fetch authentication token and user id provided a response to create user request. An authentication token is used as the header in all subsequent requests and user id in URL and body parameter as needed. Finally, have a view result tree listener where we can see all requests with their responses. Step 1: Add a Thread Group to our test plan Step 2: Add an HTTP request defaults using the config elements to define default parameters like hostname and port of server needed for all requests. Step 3: Add an HTTP request sampler to send create user request. Add body to create an HTTP request with a dynamic email parameter which is generated by pre-processor. Step 4: Add a BeanShell pre-processor to generate a random email address for creating user request. Using java code to generate a random number which is used in new email generation for each request. Step 5: Add a JSON extractor post-processor to get authentication token and userId from the response of creating user request. Reading token from JSON response using JSON extractor. Step 6: Add an HTTP header manager to add authentication token as the header to all subsequent requests. Step 7: Add update user, get user and delete user HTTP request sampler for subsequent requests in the same way as creating user HTTP request sampler with userId as dynamic variable fetched from creating user post-processor. Step 8: Add View result tree to get the response to all requests. Finally, we have our user CRUD load test ready which can be used to generate load by increasing the number of users with ramp-up time.

The Illusion of Control in ‘Black Mirror: Bandersnatch’,"How the interactive film exposes the absence of free will and choice,Choices and Consequences,Written by Howard Chai"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Howard Chai Follow -- 10 Share Black Mirror is a speculative-fiction anthology series created by Charlie Brooker that highlights the dark aspects of modern society, particularly as it relates to our relationship with technology. Each stand-alone episode paints a picture of a world that’s futuristic, yet believable; sleek, yet horrifying. Each of these study guides will examine the themes of a particular episode. All screencaps are mine. When we first got word that 2018’s entry of Black Mirror would be “interactive” and a choose-your-own-adventure-style story, I laughed. Black Mirror, with the exception of episodes like “San Junipero” and “Hang the DJ,” is a very pessimistic show. So an episode said to allow you to make choices would undoubtedly be about the illusion of choice, free will, and control. With Bandersnatch now released, that remains true. Right off the bat, the first choice you’re presented with is between two breakfast cereals for Stefan. The second is a choice regarding what music Stefan listens to on the bus to Tuckersoft. They’re obviously small choices, serving more as a tutorial for the rest of the episode, a proof of concept that shows your choices will have material effect. Stefan’s fate is in your hands; you can determine how the story unfolds and ends. -- -- 10 I strive towards a career that ends up leaving me somewhere between Howard Beck and Howard Beale.

The State of Ruby 2019: Is It Dying?,"Follow me on Twitter and check some of my other posts:,Vinicius Brasil 👾 (@vnbrs_) | Twitter,The Book Every Programmer Should Read,How to Land a Job Using Open Source,Do not be this kind of developer,Written by Vinicius Brasil,Ruby 2.6 and its new JIT compiler,Ruby on Rails new release is getting close,Ruby isn’t dying, it’s maturing"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Vinicius Brasil Follow HackerNoon.com -- 2 Listen Share There is a lot of discussion about the Ruby language demise. Well, this balderdash is circulating for a while now, and there are posts from 3+ years ago saying that Ruby is dead, but in fact, here we are. A Google Trends search shows that the Ruby interest over time isn’t decaying, but following the same pattern similar technologies are tracing. Also, always keep in mind that programming languages are tools to solve specific problems, and that is why there is no such thing as the best programming language. Ruby has gone through a lot of significant changes during the past year, and it is certainly not dying, but growing and evolving. The year of 2019 has a lot to the Ruby community. Check some of the key points below: A new version of Ruby has been released in December 2018. This release includes a lot of performance improvements and new features, including an initial implementation of a JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler. To say truly, this new JIT compiler has not achieved its best performance yet, as covered here, but has a lot of future on it. The Ruby community considers this release as an opening to the new era of Ruby. While I failed to make Ruby’s JIT production-ready in 2.6, I don’t regret what we’ve done this year. I needed to develop or lead all of the above things for Ruby 2.6, but I believe I can invest my time mainly on performance improvement in Ruby 2.7. — k0kubun Besides this new JIT compiler, this new release of Ruby has improved performance up to 1.7x, apart from the 5–10% performance improvements from Ruby 2.5.0. Ruby on Rails 6 is close. This release includes a lot of cool features that will get web development much easier, as Rails has been doing for years. 2018 has brought a major release, Rails 5.2.x, that included: And now, with Rails 6, there are a lot of exciting features, such as: Yes, Ruby was bad and Rails was slow. But that is not true to say in 2018, and won’t be in 2019. Ruby isn’t slow and Rails does scale. If it doesn’t for you, maybe you’ve chosen the wrong tools for the problem you’ve got. In 2019, let’s enjoy programming Ruby 2.6 and Rails 6! Happy New Year! twitter.com hackernoon.com hackernoon.com hackernoon.com -- -- 2 HackerNoon.com Building cool stuff with Elixir, OTP and Ruby.

"How to test services, endpoints, and repositories in Spring Boot","Why unit test endpoints?,Why unit test services?,Why unit test repositories?,Written by Emre Savcı,So how do we test controllers?,How do we test services?,How do we test repositories?"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Emre Savcı Follow We’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/news -- 4 Listen Share In this post I will show you how to write unit tests in spring boot applications. Why is it necessary to write unit test requires another article to explain. But for a brief explanation, I will tell you several things. I usually defend the argument that code without unit tests is dead code. Because, when a developer adds a new feature to some code which is not covered by a unit test, it is prone to override existing business rules (which kills the code written before). Maybe it’s not exactly prone to it, but you can imagine what errors can occur when a complex project needs to be changed. Unit testing is the only way to protect your code against breaking changes. Every time we write an endpoint we need to be sure several things work correctly. The endpoint should return the data in the correct structure and handle the request correctly. We can test it manually, which is not preferable. So we write unit tests to ensure that our endpoints work correctly. There is also another way for testing endpoints known as automation tests, but that is not the subject of this post. It should be clear already, but just in case: we need to be sure our business logic works correctly. There are several cases to test repositories. Of course we don’t test the framework itself. But we do write unit tests to be sure that our specifications or relations have been implemented correctly. Now it’s time to show you how to test our controllers in spring boot. Let’s imagine we write an application which allows us to save users in a database. We define a user entity, a user service, and a controller. Note: The examples shown in this post are not for real production use architecture Our controller has a dependency on UserService but we aren’t interested in what service does right now. So now let’s write a unit test for our controller to be sure it works correctly. We mocked our service because we don’t need its implementation details. We just test our controller here. We use MockMvc here to test our controller and object mapper for serialization purposes. We setup our userService.Save() method to return the desired user object. We passed a request to our controller and after that we checked the returned data with the following line: andExpect(jsonPath(""$.name"").value(request.getName())) . We have also other methods to use. Here is the list of methods: When we run the test we see that it passes. Now we go to test our UserService. It is quite simple to test. We mock the repository and inject our mocks into UserService. Now when we run the test we’ll see that it passes. Now let’s add a business rule to UserService: let’s say the user must have an email address. We change our save method in UserService as below: When we run the test again, we’ll see a failed test. Before we fix it, let’s write a test that satisfies this business. We wrote a new test that specified that if we send a null email, it’ll throw NullPointerException. Let’s fix the failed test by adding an email to our request: Run both tests: Now we’ve come to testing repositories. We use an in memory h2 database with TestEntityManager. Our repository is defined as below: First configure h2db. Create the file name application.yaml in test -> resources path: And let’s first write a basic test for our repository: save a user and retrieve it: When we run it we’ll see bunch of console output, and also our test passes: Now let’s add another method to our repository for searching for a user via email: And write another test: When we take a look at the console after running the test, we'll see the SQL generated by hibernate: So far so good. We have covered the basics of unit testing with spring boot. Now you don’t have any excuses to not write unit tests! I hope it is clear to you to how to write unit tests for different kinds of purposes. -- -- 4 We’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/news Sr. Software Engineer @Trendyol & Couchbase Ambassador | Interested in Go, Kubernetes, Istio, CNCF, Scalability.

What Apple Needs to Fix in 2019 (and Beyond),"The company may have more cash reserves than most countries but it risks becoming irrelevant unless it fixes glaring problems and starts taking chances,Written by Fast Company,Streamline the UX Across All Devices"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Fast Company Follow Fast Company -- 23 Share By Jesus Diaz 2018 was a rocky year for Apple. Despite becoming the world’s first trillion-dollar company this summer, it has seen disappointing sales for the latest iPhone — its main cash cow — and, worse, analysts, industry players, journalists, and users believe that the Cupertino company has stopped innovating in favor of milking its user base with marginally updated products at higher price points. It’s a dangerous game that can go south really fast. It’s not that the Apple Watch Series 4 or the new iPad Pro are bad products. They are good. But having a couple of good products and a passable phone is not enough in a hyper-competitive market where companies are working on new form factors for phones, computers, and wearables. The gap between Android and the iPhone widens—Apple has dropped to the number three phone manufacturer worldwide. Microsoft is quickly becoming the PC and tablet gold standard. Web services are dominated by Google and Amazon. And hundreds of companies are trying to create the next big thing. If Apple wants to stay on top, Tim Cook and his minions must fix a lot of things and, perhaps more importantly, start taking risks. Here’s the laundry list for 2019. As Apple’s product line diversified over the past few years, so did the user experience. Apple needs to streamline its UX across all its hardware platforms. iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Watch are all different hardware platforms that feel similar but are remarkably inconsistent at times. And other times, it’s just bad, introducing hidden features and gestures that are only used by experts. It’s not only about keeping a unified graphic appearance — although that’s important, too. It’s about unifying gestures and UI conventions while keeping it all user-centric, using scientific testing for usability — a UX research process that Apple abandoned a long time ago. If it is successful, all the products in the Apple lineup will offer a seamless… -- -- 23 Fast Company Official Medium account for the Fast Company business media brand; inspiring readers to think beyond traditional boundaries & create the future of business.

A Practical Intro to Test-Driven Development,"Test-driven development is hard — here’s the untold truth,Written by Luca Piccinelli,The Cost"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Luca Piccinelli Follow Better Programming -- 5 Share These days you read a ton of articles about all the advantages of test-driven development (TDD), and hear a lot of talks at tech conferences that tell you to: “Do the tests!”, and how cool it is to do them. And you know what? Unfortunately, they are right (not necessarily about the “cool” part, but about the useful part). Tests are a must! The typical advantages we list when it comes to talking about TDD are real: Even if I’ve always agreed with these advantages, there was a time when I thought that I didn’t need TDD to write good and maintainable software. Of course, now, I know I was wrong, but why did I have this idea despite the shiny magic of the pros? There’s only one reason: it costs a lot. It costs a lot! Someone is probably thinking: “But, it costs even more if you don’t do the tests” — and this is right, too. -- -- 5 Better Programming I am a programmer.

What Elon Musk Got Wrong With Artificial Intelligence,"Experts agree that we may not be ready for fully autonomous solutions,Written by inc. magazine"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story inc. magazine Follow Inc Magazine -- 8 Share By Anne Gherini Herbert Simon, one the inventors of Artificial Intelligence (AI), once remarked, “Machines will be capable, within 20 years, of doing any work a man can do.” Simon made this forward-thinking statement in 1965. What Simon and the other AI proponents failed to appreciate are the numerous unforeseen challenges involved in relying solely on machines. The AI field first emerged more than half a century ago. But it’s only been in the last ten years, due in large part to the rapid growth and democratization of machine learning, that we are starting to see the full potential of AI. Today, there are countless open-source AI tools that help any entrepreneur get up and running on AI quickly, including Google’s TensorFlow, Microsoft’s Cognitive Toolkit, and Amazon Machine Learning. These advancements have accelerated the transition from a model that involves AI assisting humans to one that involves humans assisting AI. This shift to requiring less human capital creates incredible opportunities for businesses to advance. Yet, many technology evangelists are pushing the needle even further and petitioning the eradication of human involvement. -- -- 8 Inc Magazine Everything you need to know to start and grow your business now.

How to Download Live Images From Government Weather Satellites,"The Theory,Written by Alex Wulff"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Alex Wulff Follow -- Share Using nothing but your computer, some software, and a $20 radio dongle you can receive transmissions from NOAA weather satellites in the sky overhead. This is an incredibly exciting project that’s easy to do but produces great images. Think about it — you can receive images from a satellite almost 1000KM straight above you! NOAA operates a series of weather satellites, designated NOAA 15, NOAA 18, and NOAA 19, that circle the Earth in polar orbits. These satellites are particularly interesting because they’re constantly transmitting an easy-to-decode image signal of what they’re currently looking at. The satellites’ orbits are configured such that one of the three passes within almost every point on the globe every three hours. You can track each of the three here. The closer the yellow line is to your location when the satellite is overhead the higher the satellite will appear in the sky. Keep in mind that the satellites’ trajectories across the globe (the yellow lines) are constantly progressing sideways by a few hundred miles with each successive orbit. You don’t really need to worry about tracking them — I’ll soon introduce a program that calculates the flyovers for you. The images are transmitted line by line via a protocol called APT (Automatic Picture Transmission). It sounds like this: These satellites transmit images at 137 MHz, which is relatively close to both FM radio transmissions (~90 MHz to 110 MHz) and 2-meter amateur radio transmissions (~144 MHz). The data itself is encoded using frequency modulation (FM), the same method that FM stations use to transmit audio. Much of the encoded information is in the range of human hearing, which is why you can actually convert the signals to audio and “hear” them! -- -- I'm a Harvard student, maker, and radio enthusiast.

Caching Ethereum events with MySQL,"Written by Oleg Kondrakhanov,Database choice,What should we store?,Implementation,Prerequisites,Interacting with MySQL,Base caching function.,Regular blockchain scanning,Retrieving the events,Further improvements,Conclusion"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Oleg Kondrakhanov Follow Coinmonks -- 5 Listen Share In this article, I am going to demonstrate a simple approach to caching Ethereum events. Here I won’t describe what events are as there are a lot of articles covering that topic (here is the perfect one). I’ll just say that typically we use events for some off-chain operations, for examples tracking token’s transfers or retrieving the filtered list of particular transactions, just like a good old SQL query. Let’s suppose we want to make a website that tracks some token transfers, a kind of Etherscan. We definitely need such simple operations like: What we have in web3 now is getPastEvents method, the example usage of which is The main issue with this approach is it can be slow as blockchain grows, especially if you don’t run your own Ethereum node and use public providers like Infura or MyEtherApi. The next thing — it is almost impossible to implement some tricky queries as filter object’s functionality is quite limited. Besides, events already written to the blockchain can’t be changed, only new records can be added with time. This and other facts make events a perfect target for caching. In this example, we’ll use MySQL as a database for holding our event records. MySQL has capabilities to store raw JSON and then compose queries using that JSON object’s properties as if they were usual SQL columns. Let’s take a closer look at the result of getPastEvents method to realize what data we work with. I took some Binance coin transfers as an example. Each event object has the following structure: As you can see, the event arguments are stored in returnValues property. blockNumber , transactionHash, logIndex might be useful too as I’ll show you later. Our goal is to write those JSON objects to the database and to implement easy access methods that can replace standard web3’s getPastEvents method seamlessly. Here is the SQL script for creating the Transfer table. Some important things to explain: Optionally we could also add database index for increasing the performance. For example, for the to column 3. To work with MySQL database in JavaScript we should install mysql package 4. And the last — MySQL server. It is worth mentioning that we’ll use MySQL 5.7 as the latest 8.0 version doesn’t seem to be compatible with the mysql package (it gave me strange error ER_NOT_SUPPORTED_AUTH_MODE while trying to connect). We’ll utilize connection pool to make queries for this example. It would be more convenient to use a promisified version of query method Now we can use the following code to insert a record into the transfer table created before. Here we also check for possible duplicate rows insertion. Now we don’t want to do anything special in that case, probably we’ve already written those duplicate events earlier or something like this. So we just consider this kind of exceptions handled. Let’s construct a contract object to retrieve events from. We can include only Transfer event interface in the abi parameter, like this: This is the base version of the caching function. First, we get event objects, then write them to the database, one by one. Now let’s expand this to a simple background script that constantly scans blockchain for the events emitted. Some utility functions The first one is simple async/await implementation of setTimeout. The second one serves for infinite periodic calls of fn — the worker function. With these helper functions, our background scanner looks quite simple Let me explain that ‘latestEthBlock + 1’ thing. Web3’s getPastEvents(fromBlock, toBlock) returns events written within that [from, to] range, including the borders. So without this incrementing the next cacheEvents call will again return the events written into latestEthBlock as a part of the result. Though duplicate events won’t be inserted into database due to unique index implemented, we still don’t want this excess work to be done. This implementation should be pretty much enough for a simple background scanner. However, there is always room for improvement. We’ll return to it a bit later. Now let’s take a quick look at what we can do now with that data. Here is an example of the function to select transfers made from a particular address We query the database using the generated from column. The most notable part here is that the result of the function looks just like the result of web3’s getPastEvents. It makes refactoring the current code a lot easier. The event object contains a lot of properties that might be totally useless for your application. It would be better to remove the excess before writing to the database. That way we are saving a lot of space. As you might also have noticed, the current version of the scanner begins with block #0 each time it is restarted. While scanning all the way to current block it will try to insert duplicate records into the database. We can eliminate that excess work by querying the database for the latest cached block. It would be also nice to start scanning not from the block #0, but at least from the block when the contract was deployed. For simplicity, you might get this information using etherscan.io. Here we again use MySQL json functions to get the blockNumber property of the event object.

Why Machine Learning Is So Important For The Future Of Photography,Written by Robert Rittmuller," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Robert Rittmuller Follow DataDrivenInvestor -- 3 Share This is an attempt to clear the air, reduce the hype, and bring some basic understanding to the subject of why machine learning matters so much to the future of photography. I don’t doubt for a moment that the hype around machine learning has roots in some amazing accomplishments, many of which I use almost daily, but when it comes to how the technology affects the world of photography, we need to dig deeper. The story really does start with recent innovations in machine learning, more specifically, the machine learning algorithms that support computer vision. Yes, you could go back further and delve into some of the work done during the last Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence “Winter” but that’s digging a bit deeper than we need to illustrate why the future of photography depends on these technologies. This CNET post comes close to getting the point across on what the future impact of this technology might be but lacks some real-world examples. What it does get right is that the recent combination within smartphones of machine learning and the latest image processing techniques is what gives us this glimpse into the future of photography. “Machine Learning” — Gives “computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.“ — Arthur Samuel Machine learning in its most basic form is the ability for a computer, or more specifically, an algorithm, to learn from the provided data. Think of it this way; you can teach a child what something looks like by showing them a photo, and if you show them more photos of similar objects they then can then learn to identify an entire class of objects. Machine learning algorithms work essentially the same way (with some important limitations we will discuss shortly) where you show the algorithm large amounts of example data and it can then “learn” to classify that data. If you do it right, that trained algorithm might even be able to classify data it has not been trained on, which is commonly referred to as “generalization”. So that’s the super-simple non-math explanation of how you might build what the machine learning world calls a “classifier” but do understand this is only scratching the surface of how this technology functions.

2018 Year in Review for Southern California Tech,"The Unicorn Club Keeps Growing,Strong Exits Across the Region,The Scooter Invasion,The Housing Crisis and Looking Ahead,Written by Mike Fernandez"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Mike Fernandez Follow -- 2 Listen Share Last month marked my five year anniversary as an investor. I first moved back to Los Angeles to join the world of venture capital in 2013, when the tech ecosystem in Southern California looked very different than it does today. Long time LA fund GRP Partners had just rebranded as Upfront Ventures, moving its office from Century City to Santa Monica. The biggest recent exits were for Cornerstone OnDemand, Riot Games, and Demand Media. GQ had recently named Abbot Kinney the coolest block in America, but the Snap-driven tech transformation of Venice was still in its infancy. Greater Southern California had a long history of building strong tech businesses, but still felt like it wasn’t living up to it’s full potential. Since then, Southern California has been on a roll. Major exits for companies like Oculus VR, BlackLine, and Lynda.com have shown that Southern California can build successful companies in diverse industries. Greg Bettinelli’s list of SoCal investors has exploded in length. And everybody in the Bay Area seems to be moving to SoCal, or at least talking about it. The trend continued with in 2018, in which Southern California saw a record number of unicorn financing rounds, several strong exits, and the emergence of what was arguably 2018’s hottest venture-backed company. According to CB Insights (plus two possible additions of Fair and Seismic right at the finish line of the year), seven companies joined the Unicorn club in Southern California in 2018. Perhaps what is most notable about these companies is their diversity in industries. For years, naysayers downplayed Los Angeles startups in particular as being too focused on consumer and media markets, and lacking expertise in enterprise software or deep tech. In 2018’s unicorn batch we see industries ranging from healthcare to law to HVAC — no media or CPG this year. Santa Monica is heavily represented on the list, but the surprise runner up city was Glendale, which counts both LegalZoom and ServiceTitan as residents. Already home to the edtech unicorn Age of Learning, Glendale has quietly emerged as a major center for tech hiring in Southern California, far away from the hype of Venice or the laboratories of La Jolla. By far the biggest news story of 2017 for the Southern California tech ecosystem was the IPO of Snap. In just a little over five years from launching, the company had managed to change the way that teens communicate, build a serious competitor to Facebook’s social media dominance (spurning acquisition offers in the process), and turn the neighborhood of Venice on its head as at spread into every square foot of available office space. Shortly after Snap went public, many LA tech watchers were left wondering, what’s next? Perhaps the theme of big SoCal exits in 2018 was perseverance. Santa Barbara-based Sonos finally went public in August, a full sixteen years after its founding. Carlsbad-based Luxtera announced a major acquisition by Cisco seventeen years after its founding. And Amazon acquired Santa Monica-based Ring, which Shark Tank investors publicly rejected on national television. These three exits showed that the vast majority of companies are not overnight successes, and they require time and patience to build in the face of constant detractors. Another major acquisition for 2018 was that of Irvine-based Cylance by BlackBerry for $1.4B. Over the past few years, Cylance has joined CrowdStrike in building a cluster of cybersecurity expertise in Irvine, and we are already beginning to see a new generation of companies emerging out of Cylance’s success, such as Obsidian Security. Meanwhile, CrowdStrike has had a banner year and is hot on IPO watch-lists for 2019. If Venice thought it would receive some respite from tech mania after the Snap IPO, it was sorely mistaken. Just a few months later, Travis VanderZanden released the first Bird Scooter onto the streets of Venice. Within a year, Bird would notch over 10 million rides, radically changing transportation in cities across the globe and setting a new benchmark for rapid growth. Wired Magazine even named 2018 the “Year of the Scooter”. In the process, the company raised over $400m from Sand Hill road heavyweights like Index, Sequoia, Accel, and CRV, as well as from almost every large SoCal-based firm: B Capital (where I work), Greycroft, Lead Edge, Upfront Ventures, Pritzker Group, and Sound Ventures, among others. Over the course of the year, Bird caused bikeshare company Lime to rapidly pivot into scooters and inspired a wave of copycats around the world. It drew Uber and Lyft into the market right in the middle of their IPO preparations. And it set off a wave of panic among municipal governments and regulators, who didn’t want to be caught flat footed in the face of a new technology on their streets. We are still in the early innings of the scooter game, but Bird’s rapidly expanding team has already shown it can continue to innovate rapidly, launching a GovTech platform and announcing an initiative to allow local operators to launching their own fleets. Time will tell how this market plays out, but Bird has been a clear proof point for Southern California’s ability to attract talent and capital to build world-changing businesses. 2018 was a year in which the tech industry was placed in the spotlight for its negative effects on society, ranging from Amazon’s HQ2 tax credit grab to the scourge of fake news. Perhaps the most pressing local issue has been tech’s impact on housing. Amid the backdrop of a much larger Southern California housing crisis, the clustering of startups around Venice and Santa Monica and large tech companies in Playa Vista and Culver City has put extreme pressure on housing prices on the Westside, leading to increasing arguments about gentrification, displacement, and what it means to be a good corporate neighbor. I am a firm believer that the long-term health of Southern California’s technology sector depends on its ability to continue to expand outside of Venice and Santa Monica, where there is simply lack of affordable housing options for employees within reasonable commuting distance. Greycroft was a pioneer in opening an office in the Arts District well before there was a notable cluster of tech companies in Downtown Los Angeles. The move is beginning to pay off, as large tech companies like Spotify put down roots and a new cluster of startups including the likes of Hollar, HopSkipDrive, and ProducePay decide to make DTLA home. I’m also encouraged to see clusters of great startups emerging in regions such as the Valley (e.g. Floqast, Papaya) and the Gateway Cities (e.g. Cargomatic in Long Beach and Next Trucking in Lynwood), where the local expertise in transportation and logistics is beginning to spawn tech-enabled challengers to a staid industry. As we look to 2019 and the future, we need to make sure that we foster these budding communities and give the same level of support that has helped the Westside produce so many winning companies. As the past year has shown, the growth in Southern California’s tech ecosystem will come from across the region, in sectors that we might not have anticipated. SoCal has finally proven without a doubt that it can compete across every subsector of tech, and the future continues to look bright. -- -- 2 VC at B Capital Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*8RUE5JX7V14mqZAQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*TLsxuy6rMKtJqHrB-_c_zw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*zVltlEg-lVXiMZ7vz3nqwg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/0*8RUE5JX7V14mqZAQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*yylAu2HpDpnJyFqW6Khw2A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*8RUE5JX7V14mqZAQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*RspC_mC19QiL__m4mUpxlg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*8RUE5JX7V14mqZAQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*Bqx7awr1HTT1RxEQH5aZPw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*8RUE5JX7V14mqZAQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*Mnc_ehiGE_ZVArLO6owOig.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*8RUE5JX7V14mqZAQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*Ans6sKAILtR_3JrzUVH-5A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*2s48FXT-YXuen8EdcpUWog.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*7-Vd2V6yvsrRROavIg5RFg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*iQJjezE8PMsrLMJyhgmWDA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*SSldMA8f2cLiwAZDfFFwVA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*v81PL_0CTnry3iWQHBAKpQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*TQlEMeYwwWc38Wqm7EfCTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*0-N4JrXpZG1KJfIrAutd3A.png']",1-Jan-19,https://medium.com/?source=post_page-----1be84db9d343--------------------------------,154,6 min read

Continuous learning and improvements is the key in this direction. One of the most important thing to observe about these companies is, their focus on SPG (Scale, Performance, Growth). So, here is my tech manifesto for year 2019. I’ve been following and learning from engineering blogs of large and small startups alike in the year 2018. There are some old and some new entries in this list which I really look forward to learning a lot this year and apply in my work. Instagram is one of largest web applications built using Python. Its enormous scale features are delight to learn from and know about. You might want to know how Instagram recommends content to over 1 billion users. Check it out here: instagram-engineering.com Again, Pinterest is one of largest deployments of Python (Django) and Kafka! Their Kafka deployment handles enormous scale and an inspiration to any app building on message queuing. As a glimpse, here is an article on their Kafka deployment and how they handle 15 million messages per second! medium.com Uber is doing a lot. Open source, AI, Machine Learning, Big Data, you name it! I plan to go through their most important articles about handling large scale and APIs. If you have ever wondered how Uber does event prediction (driver demand or when UberEats order will arrive) using ELK (Elasticsearch Logstash Kibana), here is a great article: eng.uber.com Another one of my favorite is their efforts in migrating from monolith architecture to distributed SOA. eng.uber.com Oh what a blog for tech! Loved it, specially their blog name lambda. They are on AWS ❤ ️it! They are just killing it in technology. Every engineer is publishing on the tech blog. Grofers is a pure tech company that gives right emphasis on every component of a product be it design, data, infra, architecture, UI/UX, CI/CD, or security, open source, you name it! Here is a nice article about how they are building a better grocery buying experience: lambda.grofers.com UrbanClap uses full stack JavaScript and I love their tech and product. Specially how they use Redis ❤ it! medium.com Very interesting tech blog. Amazing to see how they improved flight search user experience through algorithms. Check it out here: tech.goibibo.com I have just scratched the surface of large scale software design and architecture learning that I plan to go thru this year. There is plethora of resources that one can reach out for on the internet. Lets figure! Just love Trello. Its super cool and best SaaS tool I have come across till date. I’ve been using Trello for about 5 years now and went through their tech stack many times. This year is the time to make use of this learning in scaling and building my current product. Checkout their tech stack here: tech.trello.com I’ve been very impressed with tech stacks of Dropbox, Instagram, Pinterest, Grofers, UrbanClap, Trello, Uber etc. to name a few and will be keep following, learning and applying this year. Always been big on clean code and best practices. I’ve been reading them time and again and want to continue the same. Lets face it and accept it. We all save so many bookmarks in our web browser or medium but never turn back to them. Lets go back and read/ watch all those articles/ videos we bookmarked and remove that are not relevant or useful anymore! We’ve spent better part of the last year building and scaling current technology, product and engineering team. So, we could write and share less but we will be starting our engineering blog soon and write and share lot of learnings this year. So, off we go!

Building a CI/CD pipeline for nuget package.,Written by SleepyManiac," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in SleepyManiac Follow SleepyManiac Blog -- Listen Share Getting started So, you’re willing to publish your fist ever super awesome library as nuget package? Worry not, in this guide I will help you Creating a repository Let’s start off by creating a github repository. On github web interface, find New button. From there, enter a new repository name and choose a license (e.g. MIT). Github does not have a default .gitignore for .net projects, so leave it empty for now. Starting up your project Next thing we need to do is cloning the newly created repository. (You may use “git clone {repouri}”). First thing we need to do is creating a .gitignore for our project. The easyest way is just copying the file from another open source project (e.g. https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/blob/master/.gitignore) Now we can finally copy the library code to the repository. I prefer to put the source code in a “src” directory, but it’s entirely up to you. For an open source library, you should strongly consider adding SourceLink support https://github.com/dotnet/sourcelink. This allows other developers to debug through your code. Versioning Versioning is very hard! If you are not fancy manually versioning each and every package, I suggest using automated tools for that. The best tool I’ve been working with is https://gitversion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. This small command line tool parses the tags and branch information and is capable if incrementing the versions on it’s own! It requires zero configuration, but should you really need to adjust some values, you may place a config file to the root of your repository. In the next section, I will show you how to integrate this tool into CI/CD pipeline. CI/CD pipeline I personally think that the whole CI/CD process (outside of CI vendor-specific tasks) should be fully reproducible locally. Therefore, I recommend defining build steps using either Cake (https://github.com/cake-build/cake) Fake (https://github.com/fsharp/FAKE) or Nuke(https://github.com/nuke-build/nuke). I personally prefer Nuke, for it’s incredible integration with IDE and outstanding CLI tools. To get started with NUKE: After you go through the setup process, you should be able to see a new project appear in your solution. And it already has some steps defined for you! There is some customization required. You need to include the pack target for creating a nuget package and include reporting of test results. You may also want to create a target that combines the other targets in a pipeline to be called by the CI tool. A sample with those commands could be found in my repository here. Now, commit all the changes to source control and let’s add the Azure Pipelines integration. Add a badge to you github repo. From the build pipeline, hit the 3 dots menu and choose StatusBadge button. This will open a page with MD preset. Include this into your Readme.MD that can be found in the root of your repository. Publishing to nuget First, if you’ve done everything according to the samples provided, you can trigger the build on Azure DevOps and the resulting nuget packages will be available in the build artifacts Download the package and go to nuget.org. Find the upload button and simply drag and drop the nupkg file. Your package will go through validation process, and after it finishes it should be available for download. That’s it! -- -- SleepyManiac Blog Software developer, Game lover, SF fan.

An ode To Spotify: a good product with great product thinking,Written by Viba Mohan," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Viba Mohan Follow UX Collective -- 2 Listen Share If you ask my classmates, they’ll tell you that I’m obsessed with Spotify. I’ve based several of my projects on it. I reference it as a great product while citing examples during class discussions. And you’ll constantly find me advocating for it as the best music streaming service available. This isn’t quite simply because I think Daniel Ek(the founder) is a genius, it’s also because I think the product is a beauty all by itself. So as I look at this IDEO Pop Quiz question “What product do you find the most relevant & interesting?” — to me it‘s a no brainer. It has to be Spotify. Why, you ask? Well for one, think about what our lives looked like before Spotify. Here in India, you’d find people from all walks of life pirating music and then liberally sharing it with their friends. Even a child will be able to tell you that it’s difficult for an artist to make a living in a society like that. Sure, there was the occasional audiophile who’d collect music CDs and care for them like it was worth a fortune — because it was. But Spotify was built in an era when trust, in the music industry, was running at an all time low. Record companies would sue individuals and organisations alike for pirating music. And musicians were railing against their fans for the same. They uprooted the existing boundaries of music and redefined them in ways that I still don’t fully understand. They balanced out the needs of artists and their fans. Fans were tired of the tediousness of downloading illegal music and the fiscal costs of actually purchasing music. They were struggling with issues of loyalties to their favourite artists and they weren’t able to discover new music that felt personal yet trendy. Artists on the other hand needed to make a living and needed to truly connect with their audience. So, in the age of commercialisation, they built a product with a vision to simultaneously uplift artists, personalise music for listeners and provide smaller artists with the kind of audience they could only hope to tap into. As a designer, I recognise this to be excellent product thinking. They recognised key opportunities and exploited them in a healthy manner. They listened to their users and adapted as and when needed. To build on personalisation, they integrated a couple of niche features — like Spotify Unwrapped, Spotify Singles, playlists from your favourite artists and Daily Mixes. Spotify Unwrapped not only serves the purpose of being a subtle, high level campaign that markets the product, but also helps users feel more connected to the app and the music that they listen to. In a quaint, unimposing manner it takes you through a memory lane filled with nostalgia and triggers the pride of belonging to an artists fandom. For example, someone listened to 3000 hours of ODESZA on Spotify and now the entire ODESZA community revers him as this sort of legendary #1 fan. They built a community in a way that most apps could only dream of. And they did so by directly adding value to their users lives. Which might be what drew me to Spotify in the first place. While other streaming services cater to the simple tasks of listening to and sharing music, Spotify drew out complex yet subtle interactions that help users connect to artists in ways that they never quite did before. Plus, in this day and age, I think that they are especially relevant because they give artists a voice and a platform to reach an audience they may have otherwise never acquired. The cynic will tell you that streaming services like Spotify are killing artists. But I have a different take on this. The typical artist believes that if they keep playing shows, they’ll one day get discovered and then catapult their way into fame and fortune. But that’s not how the world works. This might be the reality of a privileged few — those who were maybe born into wealth and influence might be able to ease their way into a scenario like this, but for the average Joe, it’s their job to build their career. I’m aware that Spotify pays artists mere pennies for each stream. But the opportunity cost of a service like Spotify is more free ranging than providing an artist with a steady source of income. Spotify won’t build an artists career. It never claimed it would. But it will provide them with the data to locate and analyse their followers, connect them concerts and merchandise and boost the rate at which they are being discovered. It will help an artist find people who connect with their music and it is the job of the artist to transform passive listeners to active fans. People want a fantasy, but Spotify was built for the present day reality. A career in music is a privilege. Not everyone can hope to do this. But Spotify helps make it possible. And in my books this is both interesting and relevant because it mirrors the paradigm shift that is on going in a new society that provides you with unconventional opportunities that when met with creativity can prove to be extremely rewarding. So maybe what I’m trying to say is that I love Spotify because Spotify is a great product with ingenious product thinking. -- -- 2 UX Collective Method over madness. // www.vibamohan.com Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/2*36YVjRXTVl_UtnrNjXbPLw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*mDhF9X4VO0rCrJvWFatyxg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1500/1*2IR284QJInlk1G3mrtty8g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/0*7UM0Y_b0vi-nhk-v', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*dSyHMq9wD6oivlAYojo79w.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/2*36YVjRXTVl_UtnrNjXbPLw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*mDhF9X4VO0rCrJvWFatyxg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*A53zPVVayzl-kQup.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*36YVjRXTVl_UtnrNjXbPLw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*eRMuEkMqBda29vL2Og9YRg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*9M6n3togCidxmwDMF4DHYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*k64zdk6Y8nTjBXo5Emn1jQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*RR325hSR_UoWhUGsvDMRaA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*TlY4qdtnI2d7bVWK.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*36YVjRXTVl_UtnrNjXbPLw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*v2ULfQM2WzacQUlCiVMCCw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*3iqMiyaAO1m5cWmEyBh3CA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*kdWgCqwDL9C2mHnfoCDRkg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*CWRp_Kr1luJvSm4tjpU5VQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjeiISlLLbvNqfvg8LoZ7w.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*4OSuVPNP-0-Ze8iUSsmY4A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*ACJL3IBZmO1Tw-huBtsu0Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*VWXOGwAskgI1TPehmcx63g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*b4zYnss95wlW-JOhN6VwvQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*5F6PlHIqreKqb7o6', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*FH7hdoBfk7pBX-s69yszXg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/1*j-4XQzBkeAR0N2VcEtTU1A.gif', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*C2RjhX07tQRqXyXMt9dGLw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*NodLEUJwJji9-a7k', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/1*RW-EGZs0FkdKeRz-ot9UOA.gif', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*R9aptJpaxxaqL2xs0Yj4vA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*RNYCdpBO4YrohRtTRX5z4A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*nqaMr-ZyGH9A8kk8RzbQcg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*k64zdk6Y8nTjBXo5Emn1jQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*RR325hSR_UoWhUGsvDMRaA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*3Og2RjvjjD0H9JJEfwWt_g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*vE6OZNR7X-l8lJu-aP7GxA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg']",1-Jan-19,https://medium.comhttps://medium.com/@viba?source=post_page-----9842b3447f5a--------------------------------,410,4 min read
Top JavaScript Frameworks and Topics to Learn in 2019,"Prediction: React Continues to Dominate in 2019,Data Sources,Google Search Trends,Package Downloads,Job Board Postings,On TypeScript,Other JavaScript Tech to Learn,Other Tech to Watch,Written by Eric Elliott,You fell into the Wayback Machine! Click here to visit 2023.,Component Frameworks,JavaScript Fundamentals,The Rise of the Crypto Industry"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Eric Elliott Follow JavaScript Scene -- 36 Listen Share It’s that time of year again: The annual overview of the JavaScript tech ecosystem. Our aim is to highlight the learning topics and technologies with the highest potential job ROI. What are people using in the workforce? What do the trends look like? We’re not attempting to pick what’s best, but instead using a data-driven approach to help you focus on what might actually help you land a job when the interviewer asks you, “do you know __(fill in the blank)__?” We’re not going to look at which ones are the fastest, or which ones have the best code quality. We’ll assume they’re all speed demons and they’re all good enough to get the job done. The focus is on one thing: What’s actually being used at scale? The big question we’ll look at is the current state of component frameworks, and we’re going to focus primarily on the big three: React, Angular, and Vue.js, primarily because they have all broken far ahead of the rest of the pack in terms of workplace adoption. Last year I noted how fast Vue.js was growing and mentioned it might catch Angular in 2018. That didn’t happen, but it’s still growing very quickly. I also predicted it would have a much harder time converting React users because React has a much stronger user satisfaction rate than Angular — React users simply don’t have a compelling reason to switch. That played out as expected in 2018. React kept a firm grip on its lead in 2018. Interestingly, all three frameworks are still growing exponentially, year over year. React still has much higher satisfaction ratings than Angular for the third year we’ve been tracking it, and it’s not giving up any ground to challengers. I don’t currently see anything that could challenge it in 2019. Unless something crazy big comes along and disrupts it, React will be the framework to beat again at the end of 2019. Speaking of React, it just keeps getting better. The new React hooks API replaced the class API I’ve been merely tolerating since React 0.14. (The class API still works, but the hooks API is really much better). React’s great API improvements, like better support for code splitting and concurrent rendering (see details), are going to make it really hard to beat in 2019. React is now without a doubt, the most developer friendly front-end framework in the space. I couldn’t recommend it more. We’ll look at a handful of key pieces of data to gauge interest and use in the industry: React overtook Angular in the search trends in January 2018, and held its lead through the end of the year. Vue.js now holds a visible position on the graph, but still small factor in the search trends. For comparison: last year’s graph: Package downloads give us a fair indication of what’s actually being used, because developers frequently download the packages they need while they’re working. Overly-clever readers will note that sometimes they download these things from their internal corporate package repos, to which I answer, “why yes, that does happen — to all three frameworks.” All of them have established a foothold in the enterprise, and I’m confident in the averaging power of this data at scale. React Monthly Downloads: 2014–2018 Angular Monthly Downloads: 2014–2018 Vue Monthly Downloads: 2014–2018 Let’s look at a quick visual comparison of the share of downloads: “But you’re forgetting all about Angular 1.0! It’s still huge in the enterprise.” No, I’m not. Angular 1.0 is still used a lot in the enterprise in the same way that Windows XP is still used a lot in the enterprise. It’s definitely out there in enough numbers to notice, but the new versions have long since dwarfed it to the point that it’s now less significant than the other frameworks. Why? Because the software industry at large, and over-all use of JavaScript across all sectors (including the enterprise) is growing so fast that new installs quickly dwarf old installs, even if the legacy apps never upgrade. For evidence, just take another look at those download charts. More downloads in 2018 than in the previous years combined. Indeed.com aggregates job postings from a variety of job boards. Every year, we tally the job postings¹ mentioning each framework to give you a better idea of what people are hiring for. Here’s what it looks like this year: Again, a lot more total jobs this year than the previous year. I dropped Ember because it’s clearly not growing at the rate that everything else is. I wouldn’t recommend learning it to prepare for a future job placement. jQuery and Ember jobs didn’t change much, but everything else grew a lot. Thankfully, the number of new people joining the software engineering field has grown a lot as well in 2018, but we need to continue to hire and train junior developers (meaning we need qualified senior developers to mentor them), or we won’t keep pace with the explosive job growth. For comparison, here’s last year’s chart: Average salary climbed again in 2018, from $110k/year to $111k/year. Anecdotally, the salary listings are lagging new hire expectations, and hiring managers will struggle to hire and retain developers if they don’t adjust for the developer’s market and offer larger pay increases. Retention and poaching continues to be a huge problem in 2018 as employees jump ship for higher paying jobs, elsewhere. I say it every year: Focus on the fundamentals. This year you’re getting some extra help. All software development is composition: The act of breaking down complex problems into smaller problems, and composing solutions to those smaller problems to form your application. But when I ask JavaScript interviewees the most fundamental questions in software engineering, “what is function composition?” and “what is object composition?” they almost invariably can’t answer the questions, even though they do them every day. I have long thought this was a very serious problem that needs to be addressed, so I wrote a book on the topic: “Composing Software”. If you learn nothing else in 2019, learn how to compose software well. TypeScript continued to grow in 2018, and it continues to be overrated because type safety does not appear to be a real thing (does not appear to reduce production bug density by much), and type inference in JavaScript without TypeScript’s help is really quite good. You can even use the TypeScript engine to get type inference in normal JavaScript using Visual Studio Code. Or install the Tern.js plugins for your favorite editor. TypeScript continues to fall flat on its face for most higher order functions. Maybe I just don’t know how to use it correctly (after years living with it on a regular basis — in which case, they really need to improve usability, documentation, or both), but I still don’t know how to properly type the map operation in TypeScript, and it seems to be oblivious to anything going on in a transducer. It fails to catch errors, and frequently complains about errors that aren’t really errors at all. It just isn’t flexible or full featured enough to support how I think about software. But I’m still holding out hope that one day it will add the features we need, because as much as its shortcomings frustrate me while trying to use it for real projects, I also love the potential of being able to properly (and selectively) type things when it’s really useful. My current rating: Very cool in very select, restricted use-cases, but overrated, clumsy, and very low ROI for large production apps. Which is ironic, because TypeScript bills itself as “JavaScript that scales”. Perhaps they should add a word: “JavaScript that scales awkwardly.” What we need for JavaScript is a type system modeled more after Haskell’s, and less after Java’s. Last year I predicted that blockchain and fin-tech would be big technologies to watch in 2018. That prediction was spot on. One of the major themes of 2017–2018 was the rise of crypto and building the foundations of the internet of value. Remember that phrase. You’re going to hear it a lot, soon. If you’re like me and you’ve been following decentralized apps since the P2P explosion, this has been a long time coming. Now that Bitcoin lit the fuse and showed how decentralized apps can be self-sustaining using cryptocurrencies, the explosion is unstoppable. Bitcoin has grown several orders of magnitude in just a few years. You may have heard that 2018 was a “crypto winter”, and got the idea that the crypto industry is in some sort of trouble. That’s complete nonsense. What really happened was at the end of 2017, Bitcoin hit another 10x multiple in an epic exponential growth curve, and the market pulled back a bit, which happens every time the Bitcoin market cap grows another 10x. In this chart, each arrow starts at another 10x point, and points to the low point on the price correction. Fundraising for crypto ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) peaked in early 2018, and the 2017–2018 funding bubble brought a rush of new job openings into the ecosystem, peaking at over 10k open jobs in January 2018. It has since settled back to about 2,400 (according to Indeed.com), but we’re still very early and this party is just getting started. There is a lot more to say about the burgeoning crypto industry, but that’s a whole other blog post. If you’re interested, read “Blockchain Platforms and Tech to Watch in 2019”. As predicted last year, these technologies continued to explode in 2018: AI/Machine Learning is in full swing with 30k open jobs at the close of 2018, deep fakes, incredible generative art, amazing video editing capabilities from the research teams at companies like Adobe — there has never been a more exciting time to explore AI. Progressive Web Applications are quickly just becoming how modern web apps are properly built — added features and support from Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. It’s incredible how quickly I’m taking the PWAs on my phone for granted. For example, I don’t have the Twitter Android app installed on my phone anymore. I exclusively use the Twitter PWA instead. AR (Augmented Reality) VR (Virtual Reality) MR (Mixed Reality) all got together and joined forces like Voltron to become XR (eXtended Realty). The future of full-time XR immersion is coming. I’m predicting within 5–10 years for mass adoption of consumer XR glasses. Contact lenses within 20. Thousands of new jobs opened up in 2018, and this industry will continue to explode in 2019. Robotics, Drones, and Autonomous Vehicles Autonomous flying drones are already here, autonomous robots continue to improve, and more autonomous vehicles are sharing the road with us at the end of 2018. These technologies will continue to grow and reshape the world around us through 2019 and into the next 20 years. Quantum Computing progressed admirably in 2018, as predicted, and as predicted, it did not go mainstream, yet. In fact, my prediction, “it may be 2019 or later before the disruption really starts” was likely very optimistic. Researchers in the crypto space have paid extra attention to quantum-safe encryption algorithms (quantum computing will invalidate lots of today’s assumptions about what is expensive to compute, and crypto relies on things being expensive to compute), but in spite of a constant flood of interesting research progress in 2018, a recent report puts things into perspective: “Quantum computing has been on Gartner’s hype list 11 times between 2000 and 2017, each time listed in the earliest stage of the hype cycle and each time said to be more than a decade away.” This reminds me of early AI efforts, which began to heat up in the 1950’s, had limited but interesting success in the 1980’s and 1990’s, but only just started getting really mind-blowing circa 2010.

Distorted Dreams,Written by Senthil," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Senthil Follow DataDrivenInvestor -- 1 Listen Share December month remembers us about a long weekend, friends get together, trip. We are not an exceptional case of this. We have planned for a trip to Wayanad, Kerala from Bangalore by tempo traveler. The trip goes for 3 days. We used to celebrate both the year ending and starting with friends in this kind of trip since 2014. Before the trip start day I called the driver and informed the pickup time is 29 December 4 AM. Some of my friends are going to join this trip and they are coming from Chennai. Always the toughest roads will redirect to a beautiful ending. The same thing happened for my friend Arunjunai in next 3 days. Arunjunai and other folks started their journey towards Bangalore in Kaveri Express on 28 December 9 PM from the central railway station, Chennai. Two weeks back Arunjunai had bought new iPhone XR Worth of 79 Thousand in a single payment. He did his own savings past 6 months to get this phone. Everyone is excited about this trip. Because everyone is going to share their feelings, the good thing, the bad thing happened in the year 2018. I was excited about the following things I am going to tell my body building which I did last 6 month. ‌ I’m going to change my DP on whatsapp which will be captured from Arunjunai iPhone XR Back In the train, they were very excited about the trip and they are enjoying like trolling each other and arunjunai was sitting in the Window seat in s6 coach and he is taking funny photos of others in his iPhone XR. Now the train is crossed ARAKONAM station., Vellore. The next station is anvarthikanpettai. Its Small station train will stop 2 minutes. Train is stopped in anvarthikanpettai and Arunjunai was sitting in the window seat. The train started moving slowly. Suddenly, someone snatched his phone from outside of the window and he ran away. One second Arunjunai was shocked and he couldn’t think what to do.The train already started running in high speed and arunjunai can’t get down. Friends and arunjunai called 180 informed the theft incident to Railway police. They informed to Railway police in train and they said you can raise the complaint and they gave their phone number to arunjunai. Arunjunai exposed his feelings. Arunjunai’s friend started to search how to track iPhone. Somehow They got to know to how to track iPhone. There is an app called find my iPhone which can help to search our iphone phone in case of loss, theft. the below Link will be useful But iPhone should be in the following conditions 1. It should be connected with the internet 2. The phone should have a minimum 2 % charge 3. The phone should not be switched off 4. Apple account should match with your lost account Arunjunai started to use that app but his bad time the thief did not switch on that iPhone. Arunjunai lost his hope. He informed his parents and they felt very bad Arunjunai is worrying about their parent’s feelings. He was very guilty. The train reached Bangalore KR PURAM station, Bangalore at 29 December 4 AM. They informed to Bangalore RPS and they said to go to the majestic station to raise compliant. In order to do compliant, they need IMEI number. But arunjunai left all the documents to his flat in Chennai. Then they decided to register compliant online and will continue our trip. They used the below link to raise compliant in online. They called me. That time Traveler driver’s which booked for this trip phone number switched off. So I went to the station to pick up my friends in my bike to my apartment. While coming back to my flat my friend explained the incident to me. I got shocked and started to scolding arunjunai. We have reached my flat at 5.45 AM and started to discussing on the incident. In order to raise a complaint in online, we need IMEI number. We informed to other friends in Chennai and they send us the details and we did registration The traveler which I booked for this trip met with an accident. They said we can’t come to a trip. Sorry! We are about to drop the plan but still, we were discussing the incident. This sequence of bad events was toiling my mind and likewise, everyone was disturbed in their own way. Meanwhile, the area which he lost his phone is located in my native district. I told to arunjunai we will try. We started to explore on internet. Arunjunai again opened that find my iPhone app on my Mac laptop. Arunjunai already did settings if he lost his phone it will automatically lock and the emergency number will pop up to call. The thief switched on the phone at 8 .30AM Thief mistakenly pressed the pop up emergency number. The number own by one of my friend kalaiyarasan. Immediately we looked that tracking app.it’s started to show the location where the thief currently located. Meanwhile, we have a friend hanish his father is SI (Sub Inspector) We informed about this tracking details. Hanish decided to go there .so he is going to Start at 9.30 AM from Chennai. After 1 hour the thief again did switch off. We can’t track if it’s off. All of my friends who came to my apartment are discussing what to do now? We quickly planned something so that we can continue our trip from next day 30 December onwards and me and arunjunai will go to KATPADI railway station to register a complaint. In a funny way, I named this operation as Mission ARUNJUNAI :) I booked a train ticket. Me and arunjunai started to travel towards KATPADI. From katpadi to anvarthikanpettai by bus. While traveling in train the inspector of RPF ARAKONAM called arunjunai and enquired about the incident. Arunjunai could not recognize thief face, dress color, height weight etc… He is simply blind about a thief. RPF inspector said you would have pulled the chain in a train. But arunjunai didn’t. Finally, an inspector said first register the complaint in a katpadi station. Now hanish reached anvarthikanpettai police station. Police told katpadi station controlling this area you should go there And he said it’s not easy to get back your iPhone. So try to forget it. Arunjunai lost his hope. The train reached katpadi station at 1.50 PM. We went to Katpadi Government Railway Police station(GRPS) They enquired about the incident. We told to katpadi SI ezhil about this tracking details and location. But they are not ready to go there. He said we can’t follow your location. He said we will inform to cybersecurity team of Vellore and they will find by IMEI number. So you should remove the lost mode lock. I asked to head constable about if we get the alert again what should we do? He replied if the device switch on inform to us. We will take care. We will send people to the respective location. Arunjunai had some external influence. They pushed to get FIR(First Information Report) .because of that the inspector of katpadi GRPS got tension and he said you need FIR or phone? why are you pushing us? We will file an FIR and will put your case for pending is this ok ? The inspector behavior was bad to us. We were simply standing and listening. Finally, the inspector told to unlock your phone until we can’t get. Arunjunai did the same. We booked the train from katpadi to Bangalore and reached my apartment by 12.30 AM of 30 December with empty hands. We and arunjunai started the trip. From Bangalore, Indira Nagar at 2.30 AM and we reached Wayanad by 9 AM. Morning arunjunai got the FIR report of his Case. Arunjunai started to enjoy the trip with his fake smile. Inside he was feeling unexplained. In wayanad we have covered following place kuruva islands, Basura sagar dam, Meenmutty falls, Pookada lake, Soochipara falls. After covering all these places I confirmed that Kerala is God’s own country After the sunset, we are traveling to the hotel. Now time is 7.30 PM. Again there was a missed call from iPhone to that emergency number. Arunjunai opened the find my iPhone app and started to the tracking number. Again the device is located in the same place. He immediately informed to SIezhil and ezhil said we will send the constable to that place. The constable name is munisamy . He is living near to that tracking place. We are more than 4 people surrounded and watching the movement of the thief. Arunjunai got the contact number of that constable and called. Arunjunai started explaining about where the device located and movement of the device. The constable told I will reach the location in 10 min. Time is now 8.10 PM. next 1 hour is going to be a thriller. Constable Reached the place. Arunjunai explained how to share his live location via WhatsApp. Constable actively listened and followed arunjunai instructions Arunjunai going to redirect the location. When India-Pakistan cricket match and india need 10 runs from 6 balls . dhoni is on strike. All of us hoping on Dhoni. Arunjunai was in the same scenario. He is hoping that thief is going to cought. But worst thing if Dhoni got out we will lose our hope. Same the thief did switch off again. The iPhone went non-trackable mode. All were in lub tub lub tub lub situation. Arunjunai informed to the constable that the last location of the phone and he said thief did switch off. Arunjunai said you’re near to the place. Go straight and take right. But constable munisamy said I’m living in this area. If I go inside is not good. So he arranged one more trustable guy Karthik. Constable munisamy and karthik are standing the street where the device lost his last connectivity. Karthik enters inside of that street and arunjunai is telling the route. Karthik is standing the thief exact location which we got from find my Iphone app. Karthik informed to constable munisamy about that thief home. Then constable munisamy said karthi come back. Constable munisamy said we have suspected the thief X person in 70%. But we can’t take any action without confirmation. Constable munisamy said keep track the device if it’s got connect immediately inform to me at any time. Constable munisamy said I will inform about the suspect X person to SI ezhil. Based on his suggestions will take action. Constable munisamy singing off. Arunjunai is feeling to not getting his phone. Me and others are started to enjoy the party in a hotel. We did a campfire and it was awesome. Arunjunai realized that he would have taken insurance of that iPhone. When he bought an iPhone XR from showroom he didn’t take insurance. If would have taken he can claim. Time almost 1 AM 31 December-midnight. All of us feeling the sleepy mood. So we went to a room to sleep. Morning we got a call from SI Ezhil and he said we got the culprit. The suspected X person is the thief. We got your phone. We will send you photos of your phone. That Time arunjunai was in deep sleep. Arunjunai gets up from a bed and we informed your phone found. Arunjunai is very happy now. He was flying on the happiness. SI ezhil called to arunjunai in order to confirm your phone we need IMEI and bill document. Arunjunai said I can unlock my phone and I can trigger alarm sound. Arunjunai did and police confirm that this is arunjunai phone. SI ezhil said come today( 31 December) to KATPADI GRPS. But arunjunai said I’m in Wayanad. I will come tomorrow(1 January) . SI ezhil said come on 2 January, we will hand over your phone in front of the Katpad Railwat station court. Arunjunai thanked them a lot. I can see his happiness after his phone found.

in Sign up Sign in Takuya Ichise Follow TAKUYA ICHISE -- Share 深圳6日目の続きです。2年ぶりに電気街 華強北を散策してきました。 2年前はこんな感じ。 medium.com medium.com OPPOの旗艦店も訪問。Xiaomiと違ってこちらはスマホの販売のみ。 電気街をぐるっと散策。 ドラム楽器とe writing boardが多くの場所で売られてました。知育系ガジェットが流行ってるんでしょうか。 e writing boardは値段も手頃で、書き心地も良かったので1個購入。 今回華強北で一番驚いたこと。kino-moのHypervsnみたいな3D Povが1万ちょいで売られてて、小さな路面店でも使われてました。 3D PovはCEATEC 2018では展示物より目立つくらいまだ珍しがられてましたが、深圳のあとに訪れた台北の路面店でも同じものが使われてたので、今後日本でもあっさり広まりそうです。 3DではないPovは以前からありましたが、色んな形状のものが売られてたのはちょっと驚きました。 下の写真は茂田さんに教えていただいた賽格廣場にあるフライドポテトの自販機。WeChatで支払うとフライドポテトが出来上がります。味は可もなく不可もなく。 華強珠宝世界の上にあるWeChat払いできるマッサージチェアも体験。 無人コンビニ 百鲜GO无人超市 华强北店は訪れた時はちょうど店舗リニューアルのタイミングでした。残念 夜も華強北を散策。 LEDのライトアップがすごい。Seg ビルも光ってます。オブジェや地下入り口に使われてる透過ディスプレイがカッコよかったです。 地下街も散策。 無人VR機 肉丸VRを発見。 宿泊場所は華強北駅と燕南駅の中間くらいにあるMy Pleasant Hotelにしました。宿泊費は3000円ほど。施設は少し古いですが、立地は最高でした。 www.agoda.com 朝ごはんは卵の革に肉を包んだ食べ物。 羅湖経由で香港に戻って重慶大厦のHouse

2018: A Year in Review,"The Bigger Things of 2018,Here are a few (mostly chronological) highlights from 2018:,Written by Sarah Hubbard"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Sarah Hubbard Follow -- Listen Share Traveled to ten countries. Worked on three different teams at Microsoft. Got a puppy. Spoke at GHC. Woah — this is the fifth edition of my year in review!! (See 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017) Feels crazy that five years have flown by. Below I’ll capture some of my favorite highlights of the year and goals for next year. This years post turned out to be a bit longer than previous ones! I created a 1 second per day video this year! I missed a handful of days, usually mid-work week, but for the most part this shows every day of my year. I’ve already loved looking back on this probably a hundred times throughout the year — it brings me so much joy looking through the little moments and people that make day-to-day life so special. Check it out: I’m so grateful for some of the places I’ve had the chance to visit and some of the highlights of the year, but I will preface this all by saying *most* of my days lately consist of working long hours (not seeing the sun and jumping between conference rooms, morning + afternoon coffees), coming home and taking care of Ollie or talking with Josiah, sometimes making dinner, and sometimes continuing to work from the couch. I don’t document these moments as much, but they make up the majority of my time. What most days look like: A huge rollercoaster this year was switching teams within Microsoft. After close to ~30 interviews/coffee meetings I made the decision to switch from Skype to a Mixed Reality Incubation team. I started working on an educational VR project and also found out the entire org was going to be cut the first week I joined. Sensing the turmoil here, I was able to switch over to another team, Azure IoT, that I’m really excited about. This ended up being close to a 6 month process— prepping for interviews, interviews, wrapping up work, starting new work, everything falling apart, starting over again — I felt really behind and spent all my time outside of work dealing with figuring out work. However, it does feel like it was all worth it! I’m in a place now that is supportive, challenging, fast-paced, and with lots of opportunity. I’ve already learned a lot and am excited for the potential growth here. The other big life change was getting a French Bulldog puppy, named Ollie (@olliethefrenchiepup), with Josiah. Ollie has become such a huge part of both our lives and I have so much love for our little fam. It’s really the first time another being has depended on me and my actions — there has definitely been a shift towards more deeply understanding the responsibility of providing for another life. Puppy training has been frustrating at times, but all worth the work. One day this fall, Ollie had a terrible seizure, and we rushed him to the emergency hospital immediately. It was one of the most frightening moments I’ve experienced. We believe he has epilepsy, which has added to our caregiving responsibilities. Josiah and Ollie are such a big part of my life, daily routines to the park and lounging on the couch together, it’s hard to imagine life now without our little pup. Overall, what I find myself most anxious about is this constant pressure I put on myself to have all the answers. Sometimes it feels like there are so many things I want to do, but not enough time in this lifetime to do them all. It feels like age 30 is some sort of looming deadline to have life figured out — starting a family, doing work that is fulfilling, being successful and happy, and settling down in one place. Although I’m making progress towards these goals I care about, it still feels like a ticking clock. I can’t help but mull-over all the possible paths I could take — should I go to grad school (if so, for what) or work somewhere different or move somewhere international or sell everything and go backpack around — sometimes it feels like there are a lot of doors open and closed at the same time. I’m not exactly sure what I want my dream career to be or where I see myself 5 or 10 years from now. As more of my friends from high school are engaged, married, or have kids, it makes me feel old and like I should have my whole life figured out by now. I end up reminding myself that each year when I write these posts, more happens in life each year than you can ever predict, opportunities arise, and tragedy strikes. I have to remember that as long as the actions I take keep aligning towards my principles or north star, the answers figure themselves out along the way. Plus, as much as I crave answers, I’d much prefer figuring out ambiguity and am learning to let go of this need for control. I’m starting to practice that instead of “analysis paralysis” or trying to keep all these options open, making a big decision and then jumping in and rolling with it, feels so much better. Favorite show: The Newsroom (older show, just watched) Favorite movies: The Post & BlackkKlansman Favorite failure: I really wanted to work on the Mixed Reality team— I took Unity classes for months, interview prepped, went to Seattle VR meetups, and tried out all the devices. I interviewed for a position I really thought I had and didn’t get it. When I finally got a different position it got cut the week I joined. I was crushed to work so hard for something and see it crumble as soon as I had it in my hands. Looking back, it all worked out in the end. Things I want to do in 2019: It’s starting to sink in that the concrete goals I set for myself, I tend to accomplish, and the vague ones show up year after year. I’m going to try to have fewer, concrete actions for 2019. I had honestly never even heard of Azure IoT last year, and now I work there. I hadn’t planned on going to Machu Picchu anytime soon, and this year my family and I hiked for days to see the wonder of the world. I was excited to attend GHC for the first time last year, but had no idea I’d get the chance to speak there this year in front of hundreds of people. It’s astounding how little I could predict about 2018. And 2019 will undoubtedly bring the same unknowns. “The best part of the journey is the surprise and wonder along the way” - Ken Poirot Thank you for being a part of my journey. Here’s to filling 2019 with life and love. Happy New Year! -- -- Technology & Public Purpose Fellow at Harvard. Prev PM @ Apple, Microsoft.

The 2018 VR/AR Tier List,"A-TIER DISCUSSION,B-TIER DISCUSSION,A-TIER DISCUSSION,B-TIER DISCUSSION,A-TIER DISCUSSION,B-TIER DISCUSSION,A-TIER DISCUSSION,B-TIER DISCUSSION,Written by Khoi Le,OVERALL TOP PICKS,CONSUMER VR,ENTERPRISE TRAINING,CONSUMER AR HEADSET,POTENTIAL CONSUMER AR HEADSETS,MOBILE AR,MOBILE AR SDK,CONTENT,CONCLUSION"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Khoi Le Follow Virtual Reality Pop -- Listen Share Ranking the VR/AR industry across the board Most videogames with differentiated characters have a tier list. It’s a ranking of which characters are the best in the game due to their special abilities or stats. Here is the 2018 tier list for the VR/AR industry. A-Tier — Actual contenders B-Tier — Things that exist but don’t really exist Having PSVR as number one may be a little controversial, as PSVR is solely focused on gaming, and most people believe that VR extends beyond gaming. However, there is no denying the success of PSVR. In August, Sony officially announced three million PSVR units sold (over $1B in revenue). Super Data estimates 1.3M PSVR units sold in 2018 alone. On top of clear sales numbers, 2018 PSVR has phenomenal exclusives like Astro Bot: Rescue Mission, while delivering industry breadwinners like Beat Saber. Currently, VR’s consumer behavior mirrors that EXACTLY of traditional gamers In retort to the “but VR isn’t about gaming!” statement, it’s become increasingly clear that currently, VR’s consumer behavior mirrors that EXACTLY of traditional gamers (own high-end hardware, play alone + online, spend > $30 for killer content). So much so that Oculus has begun to call the Quest (standalone headset coming out 2019) the “Nintendo Switch” of VR AND brought Aaron Davies back to head up gaming content. Moreover, Oculus’s promoted titles and million dollar funded content (see Marvel: Powers United) have, to my knowledge, all been games. Clearly, Facebook/Oculus have committed to the fact that games are the near-future consumer power play. Just look at the way VR controllers are designed. VR controllers scream “use me to play games!” Number two for 2018 is the Oculus Go. Released in May, the Oculus Go was touted as accessible VR for anyone. No PCs, no wires, no phones, all for $199. My little brother could bring VR to a retirement home in a village in the Spanish mountains, my students could build VR apps on their own laptops, and Walmart could train over a million employees. This was an incredible step forward for the industry. Super Data estimates Oculus Go sales clocking in at 1.1M units, and even realist Oculus CTO John Carmack was impressed with Oculus Go sales. For pure in-home VR, Rift has better content, better set up (less cables and wall mounts/tripods), and better controllers than Vive. Oh the perennial Rift vs. Vive square off. CES 2018 saw the announcement of the Vive Pro: higher resolution, built-in headphones, adjustable housing for glasses/lashes*, and a wireless adapter to go tetherless. It sounds like the Vive Pro is perfect for…VR arcades. I put Vive above the Rift on the tier list simply due to the fact that LBE-VR (location-based entertainment) is largely Vive-centric, IMO due to Vive’s larger tracking space capabilities. Arcades and LBE easily outpace home usage of VR, which puts Vive ahead of Rift for consumers. *As an aside, I absolutely hate that Oculus Rift was designed seemingly exclusively for people with large, protruding noses (Oculus is an American company). As someone with a flat nose, a huge amount of light leaks into the Rift when I use it. Meanwhile HTC, a Taiwanese company, has clever nose flaps on the Vive that block out light if your nose is flat and pull back if your nose protrudes. Please design products for people of all shapes. If you think arcades are NOT consumer VR, then I would put Rift ahead of Vive. For pure in-home VR, Rift has better content, better set up (less cables and wall mounts/tripods), and better controllers than Vive. Rift also pulled slightly ahead in Steam market share this year. I just think in-home PC-VR is still a very small market. If you’re an Oculus fan, don’t worry about Rift being the bottom of the A-tier. Oculus has clearly shifted its focus away from PC-VR, even supposedly cancelling the Rift 2. The Oculus Quest will be an interesting contender next year. Going into 2019, I think games will become the pivotal point for consumer VR headset adoption. Rumors of Nintendo Switch’s “test VR-mode” make me curious about Nintendo potentially making a play in the space. As we know from Pokémon Go and Super Smash Bros Ultimate, Nintendo’s IP makes huge PR ripples and convinces people to spend money. As standalone 6-DOF VR with 6-DOF controllers hit the market, look to see this list completely upended next year. A quick discussion about the B-tier. These are B-tier due to very few units sold and a lack of content. HTC Vive Focus was the first standalone 6-DOF VR HMD to release to consumers. BUT it was only in China, and there were no 6-DOF controllers. There are very limited use cases in which having 6 degrees of freedom is useful without 6-DOF hand-tracking — in fact, the only one I can think of is 3D asset viewing (and even that benefits from having tracked hands). I’ll throw the Lenovo Mirage Solo into this boat as well and say that this leads to a very confused purpose. Developers aren’t sure what to build for the platform, and consumers aren’t sure what to use the platform for. It’s a sad limbo between Oculus Go, which can achieve standalone 360-video viewing and basic interactive experiences, and the Rift/Vive, which have full VR capabilities. Thus, no content. Be on the lookout, however, as the Vive Focus makes its way into Chinese classrooms and Western enterprises. Vive also announced the coming of 6-DOF controllers, and Google already has devkits out. Whether or not the Focus can rival the upcoming Oculus Quest is a different matter, as the Quest will have similar specs at a lower price point. Windows Mixed Reality headsets are… I don’t even know. They are super cheap, require no set up, and work on most Windows machines. However, I think this is also a content issue for now. There is also a lack of support from Microsoft to really market and push these headsets, especially towards developers. Even though they gave me a free headset and brought me in for a multi-day build-a-thon, I never ended up shipping my game for Windows MR due to development barriers. I can see the Vive Focus and Google Lenovo Mirage Solo both making a play next year once they have their 6-DOF controllers. Windows MR will require a huge play from Microsoft to survive. A-Tier — Large clients signed B-Tier — Sleeper companies (watch for deals and growth in 2019) I’m not that familiar with the smart glasses space, so the companies above use headsets capable of tracking and 3D renderings. I acknowledge the fact that Google Glass and companies like DAQRI and Vuzix are contenders in the enterprise space. I believe that enterprise contenders mark their spot on this list by signing large deals. This year, HoloLens signed a $480M deal with the United States Army*. HoloLens also powers the solutions used by #3 and #4 companies Scope AR and Taqtile. Moreover, Microsoft is backing the future of HoloLens, creating a HoloLens 2.0. As a “standalone holographic computer,” the HoloLens is a powerful unit with just enough capabilities for enterprise training needs. Aside from signing a $480M deal with a huge client with potential for future horizontal scaling, controlling the hardware is what makes HoloLens the #1 for 2018. *Side note, I feel ethically uncomfortable with AR being used to enhance activate combatants’ ability to kill. I acknowledge that, arguably, AR will also enhance their safety. STRIVR signed a massive deal with Walmart this year. EVERY single one of Walmart’s (nearly 5,000) stores will have STRIVR in it. Almost 17,000 Oculus Go’s will be used to train Walmart employees. STRIVR’s other clients include Verizon, jetBlue, and Chipotle. STRIVR’s software is rapidly becoming a robust product suite, and its team is quickly growing. During a meeting at STRIVR this year, a potential software partner gawked in awe and told me, “I’ve never seen a VR startup this big.” Scope AR lock(he)ed in a deal with Lockheed Martin Space (halving onboarding times) and Taqtile worked with the King County Water Treatment. Mira Reality’s key advantage is the fact that they have a smartphone-based solution rather than the HoloLens. Why are smartphones better? Smartphones are easy-to-secure devices, secured by standard enterprise security software installations. HoloLenses need to be uniquely onboarded onto enterprise Wi-Fi in a secure fashion, which is costly (time and money). I’m concerned for Mira’s moat, as it seems like other companies can easily replicate. Mursion is focused on interpersonal skills, which is a unique niche that has a good market of existing L&D products. Mursion uniquely employs actors to remotely engage with trainees through virtual avatars. Actors make compelling behavioral realism, but are expensive to scale. Meta is hanging in there, but seems to be floundering. I hope it holds on, since Meron Gribetz has a good vision. This doesn’t even deserve a list. Consumer AR HMDs are non-existent. But alright, let’s talk about potential contenders. A-Tier — Good showing this year B-Tier — Keep an eye on Based on 2018’s showing, Magic Leap is the only potential contender to become a consumer AR headset in the next 5 years. I think the HoloLens is not going to be a player in the consumer space and is clearly making moves towards enterprise use cases. Similarly, Meta has also staked its position as an enterprise play (it’s tethered to a high-end PC for crying out loud), even denouncing consumer use cases. Magic Leap has set up partnerships and positioned itself as a consumer content focused device. As the price point decreases, the form factor slims, and the experience improves, Magic Leap will easily claim this space. Experiences already include: games like Seedling and Luna: Moondust Garden and Dr. Grordbort’s Invaders, streaming/news services like Cheddar and NYT AR, and music experiences like Sigur Ros’s Tonandi. This is a 2018 list. I only put Apple in the B-tier because they have not officially announced an AR headset…yet. As soon as Apple announces their AR headset, which is rumored to be in the next two years, Magic Leap will have to fight very hard to get into the hands of consumers. I truly believe Apple will be the first large tech company who can take a crack at AR for the mass consumer. But it’s a 2018 list, so they’ve got to be in the B-tier. Avegant has no public product yet. However, I believe the company has the foundation for a strong AR headset play (or acquisition play) in the next 10 years. Avegant has excellent technologists building lightfield displays (light enters your eye as if it were bouncing off a real object). They also have experience with and a good relationship with hardware production lines. A-Tier — Real usage B-Tier — Sleeper companies to look out for I don’t care about all the mobile AR games out there. Snapchat has over 70 million users use AR EVERY day. Snapchat Lenses, filters developed by third parties, are the first look at the large-scale distribution of AR content created by artists and developers. No need to download an app, just open Snapchat. I would say that Snap is the largest distributor of AR content in the world. Snap has introduced the masses to the concept of digital objects (filters and dancing hot dogs) overlaid on top of the real world. I strongly believe that the camera will soon become a platform, and Snapchat currently owns that space for a huge number of users, albeit in a specific demographic. Houzz’s new feature, View in My Room, released in May, is an AR feature where one can preview a piece of furniture at scale in their house. Over 2 million shoppers have used View My Room in the Houzz app. That’s huge. I don’t count Pokemon GO because it is questionably AR and wasn’t released this year. However, it’s still going strong! To be honest, I didn’t try that many mobile AR titles this year. If you’re interested in mobile AR titles, definitely check out arcritic.com. Torch AR is a fantastic application that delivers real value. Torch intends to deliver simplistic prototyping tools for UX designers creating mobile AR apps. Drag and drop assets from Sketchfab and Poly into the world to easily set up a scene, link them with various interactions, then click through your medium fidelity prototype. I am eager to see their growth in 2019, especially under the fantastic vision of Paul Reynolds, whom I was lucky enough to speak with earlier this year. Paul showed me live realtime video integrations with Torch, demonstrated Torch’s complex interaction systems capabilities, and painted Torch’s future as the “InVision” of AR. Early in 2018, I built the first AR short film, Snowbird, with my friend Max Korman. Through building and shipping Snowbird, I established several predictions. Well, I was right on all four. So right, in fact, that Within itself made an AR story platform for kids: Wonderscope. Wonderscope is a well-crafted application that brings AR stories to kids. It combines a wonderful 2D interactive narrative through a great mascot with augmented reality and voice interaction that encourages reading. Currently with three stories, Wonderscope will become a platform for AR short stories geared towards children, though I see Within launching more mature stories soon. My first impressions of the stories were that they were quite gimmicky and haven’t fully leveraged the AR medium yet, but it’s only a matter of time until they figure it out. Already, the user experience of “finding a landing place” for the AR story helicopter is a fantastic way to get users to scan their environment. ARKit 2, Apple’s native AR SDK, has a wealth of features that make it incredibly powerful right now. Firstly, the baseline tracking is superb because Apple has full control and access to the hardware. ARKit 2 has persistence, multiuser, 2D image recognition and movement tracking, 3D object scanning and recognition, and most importantly: Quick Look. Quick Look will enable native Apple apps like Safari and Mail to preview .uszd files in AR. Apple even claims you’ll be able to see reflections of real surroundings in shiny objects! ARCore is the Android equivalent to ARKit. ARCore has some great features, including cross-platform capability for shared experiences, meaning an Android user and an iOS user can simultaneously, locally view the same AR experience. ARCore has to deal with a variety of different hardware devices due to the variability of Android phones in the wild. 8th Wall is an SDK that utilizes ARCore on compatible Androids, ARKit on compatible iOS devices, and uses its own algorithms on other devices. Plainly stated, it is trying to bring AR to every device. 8th Wall’s killer feature is web AR, augmented reality that works in your mobile browser. Yes. Go to intothespiderverse-ar.com right now to check it out. Ubiquity 6 has an all-star team backed by all-star funders. They are another SDK working on killer computer vision solutions for mixed reality. They did an exhibition at the SF MOMA earlier this year with over 100 people leaving persistent artifacts in augmented reality. 6D.ai is built on solid tech (I believe from Oxford) and good leadership under Matt Miesnieks. Their distinctive feature is occlusion. They also have fantastic physics based on real-time world meshing. The goal for 6D.ai is to crowdsource a 3D mesh of the world, which will be huge. They also have Cymatic Bruce ❤ Full disclaimer, I don’t try as much VR/AR content as I should. As a student, it’s really hard to find time to put on the headset. I don’t play many VR games anymore, so I’m sorry to all the other 2018 releases that didn’t make the cut. If you’re curious about the other games, I take Jesse Damiani’s opinion of the top 25 games very seriously. I didn’t get a chance to try SPHERES, Pixel Ripped, or Stormlands, all of which were large titles this year. A-Tier — Fantastic Titles B-Tier —Experiences with missed potential Beat Saber just absolutely crushed it by being insanely fun. ‘Nuff said. There’s plenty of glowing (no pun intended) reviews out there. Beat Saber identified one fun mechanic in VR, slashing things with a light saber, and distilled it and amplified it to the MAX. Where Thoughts Go is a pure, refined, emotional piece that leaves you feeling vulnerable, healed, raw, and refreshed. Made by a team lead by Lucas Rizzotto and Darragh Dandurand, Where Thoughts Go is the first experiment that shows the potential of technology to bring people together. Disclaimer, I am now friends with Lucas and Darragh, they are brilliant, authentic, playful people. I look forward to seeing what they make next. Virtual Virtual Reality is whimsical and clinical, playful and dark, easy and challenging, and a whirlwind of fun. All of the interactions, stories, characters are ridiculous yet believable. In a world where humans now serve robots, you enter various virtual realities to fulfill the wishes of a plethora of demanding artificial intelligences. Arguably this was released on Daydream in 2017, but really who uses Daydream? Baobab’s Invasion was the first VR content I ever tried, and I absolutely loved the colors, quirky characters, and fun animation style. Baobab quadruple delivered with Crow: The Legend. Crow: The Legend is a impeccably-crafted immersive narrative based on the Native American legend of the crow. Crow: The Legend is voiced by an all-star cast including CONSTANCE WU!!! Oprah, John Legend, Diego Luna, Liza Koshy and Tye Sheridan. I loved the colors, the environments, the lighting, the little animals and their quips. Baobab paces VR stories extremely well, leaving you in incredible environments just long enough to enjoy them while still being able to follow the story of Crow. What did the crow do? Watch it to find out. Okay, so Tender Claws crushed it with Virtual Virtual Reality. However, I was left wanting more from TendAR. TendAR is an experimental interactive app on your phone where you feed a virtual fish through your emotions. Smile at the feed-o-meter and your fish will eat “happy flakes” and become happy. But what if you’re having a bad day, will your fish comfort you? No, your fish will eat sad flakes and become sad as well, leaving you feeling guilty and probably even worse :( TendAR doesn’t really leverage spatial AR well. The fish allegedly swims around your world but there is no sense of depth besides how big your fish is. The tracking experience is poor and the UX related to your fish’s position in 3D space is similarly lacking and confusing. However, TendAR makes great use of effects for the face and emotions AR portion of the application. It’s a lot of fun to see the particles swirl around in realtime, adjusting to your emotions using Google’s emotion detection API. There is also an area where your fish has a fish tank and you can use coins to buy decorations. This seems pretty out of place, as these decorations don’t exist in the AR experience, as well as seeming very mobile-store-in-app-purchase-y. Overall, TendAR has great parts of an app — fun to make weird facial expressions, cool to see fish swim around real world, entertaining to see fish make weird facial expressions, relaxing to decorate fish tank — but lacks solid cohesion across the various stages, leading to a disjointed game loop. Disclaimer, I tried BOT-NET when it was released, but still early. I think they have new updates coming out with multiplayer. I just wasn’t super impressed with the AR affordances. Most of your real world is blocked out by a virtual landscape (okay it’s an AMAZING virtual landscape with excellent graphics and animations and particles), defeating the purpose of AR. However, let’s say this is more of a…hand-held VR experience that utilizes ARKit for tracking. Tracking is a little jumpy, so the movement in the game is a little rough. There’s also a joystick in the screen, so you don’t even have to move in real life, which confused me. Holding your phone up is tiring, holding up your phone AND using your thumbs to move and shoot is SUPER tiring. The narrative is unclear and the objective is equally unclear. The first 5 minute rule, where you need to hook the user in the first 5 minutes, was lost on BOT-NET’s design. It just plopped me in and had me start shooting stuff. However, I absolutely am floored by the graphics level achieved while using ARKit’s tracking. The animations and models in BOT-NET are very polished and put together, leading to a pretty immersive feel. Overall, the art team did a wonderful job, but the gameplay is a little flat. 2018 was a building year for VR/AR. We saw devs buckling down to create real value, powerful tools, next level narratives, and gloriously imaginative worlds. Next year will be what I call “the standalone standoff.” As the Vive Focus, Google Lenovo Mirage Solo, and Oculus Quest go head to head with 6-DOF standalone tracking and 6-DOF controllers, I expect big deals to be signed, crazy content to emerge, and valuable use cases to be identified. -- -- Virtual Reality Pop building fanhouse.app to empower creators Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy

SAFE SPACE: The Strange Rise Of Dating Apps For The Far-Right,"“NOTHING BUT LOVE FOR MY PRESIDENT”,Written by Bailey Steen"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Bailey Steen Follow -- 3 Share The dating scene isn’t easy for Republicans. As users cite “rejection discrimination” on mainstream platforms such as Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, and OkCupid, several reactionary right-wing independent dating apps have begun flooding the market promising to deliver on these lustful safe spaces. Just like their prefered politicians, however, the irony is incredibly rich. “This app is about love for conservatives by conservatives,” declared Righter founder Christy Edwards Lawton, the die-hard Trump supporter who spoke with Vox about leftist hegemony over the market. “I think people should date who they want to date. If you want to date a blonde, date a blonde. If you want to date a skinny person, date a skinny person. I don’t think that’s discrimination,” she added, “[but] they’re the ones telling us how racist we are, and how shortsighted we are, and it’s like, really? I just feel like it’s very rude. Get on a different app, [leftists]. Righter is not the app for you.” Righter, nonetheless, still follows the footsteps of the reactionary competition such as Conservatives Only, Donald Daters, Dating Republicans, TrumpSingles, Gun Lovers Passions, Patrio, and countless more across America. Emily Moreno, the founder of Donald Daters, credits her cite to the left for their behaviour of walking out on dates “before the drinks had even arrived” if they’re discovered to be supporters of the GOP. As framed by journalist Gaby Del Valle, “these conservative apps think liberals who refuse to date conservatives are doing something more destructive than looking for partners who share their values. To them, it amounts to anti-conservative discrimination… which [Moreno] said has intensified under Trump.” This is funny given the foundation of Trump’s rise, along with the banter from his base, is about culture-war provocation, as seen in Righter’s own Instagram post where a picture of migrants waiting at a border wall being caption: “ACCESS DENIED” while US soldiers are stringing barbed wire with the words “FREE BENEFITS”, granting veterans premium access to the site. Moreno told the publication: -- -- 3 newsman Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*EtJi4Qq7W0zrQwjL7JRfpg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1500/1*WdiM6FXJ9caf8xMfkIGsqw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*EtJi4Qq7W0zrQwjL7JRfpg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*02X3pGRJfRDCdlL9kLjT9g.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*EtJi4Qq7W0zrQwjL7JRfpg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*kJzUcY3iaBaK5gbnOLWQGg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*EtJi4Qq7W0zrQwjL7JRfpg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*BrMgngDtfOF3uksb_OHP8w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*EtJi4Qq7W0zrQwjL7JRfpg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*nBHCtJgl5Sn3nXcYiHedzg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*EtJi4Qq7W0zrQwjL7JRfpg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*_wvc1IOHe1qT5s7-hNm2JQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*wzwnJD8UpPtAd2YoIPEiNQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*TcF9rICJPQZsrzNignSvgw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*niQ0sAwUszuyNMyH.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*pZPMtIONqtJYi2xHYD_Ivg.jpeg']",1-Jan-19,https://medium.com/?source=post_page-----368d56314847--------------------------------,100,6 min read

2018 Review: What I learned in 100 days Blockchain Events,"Version 1.1 with many pictures,Visiting Meetups to learn about specific topics helped a lot:,About the author:,Written by Claudio,From AI to Blockchain,Blockchain technology stands for much more than just cryptocurrencies,Hackathons are a great way to learn & try out fast use case ideas,The Blockchain world is already colorful and very diverse,The future of Blockchain is not Blockchain: D(L)T, zero knowledge proofs, dApps & quantum secure computing,Sharing knowledge,Relevant areas besides payment are record keeping (e.g. vehicle history), distributed computing (e.g. supply chain product lifecycle) and property & asset management with token.,What’s for 2019?"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Claudio Follow #NextLevelGermanEngineering -- Listen Share Coming from machine learning (deep learning) and leading a data science team in 2017, I wanted to utilise this knowledge in the field of Blockchain. With friends we used our New Year’s holiday to a have a private programming trip and analysed financial as well as social media trends in correlation to cryptocurrencies values. My Resume, the long-term global Bitcoin trend couldn’t be predicted accurately, because the internet currency is not a repetition of a similar pattern. And after our programming holidays, we had to focus on job tasks.Alled with BBB ended quickly after a hackathon group participant secretly, see this git commit, placed a coin miner on our site — it’s uncomfortable with me to this day You hear much about cryptocurrencies, but the really special thing about it actually the concept behind it, the Blockchain technology. In order to understand Blockhain one has to understand the technological fundamentals, consenus algorithms, the functioning of fullnodes and the peculiarities of different platforms. Within the framework of the projects in the Porsche Digital Lab in Berlin we were able to do exactly that. We have worked our way up from the basics to smart contract programming. This has laid a very good foundation and allowed us to solidly evaluate use and business cases. In many Hackathon events you could get to know a ton of Blockchain ideas, great people and new technologies first hand. These were often cross-industry and showed the whole field of possibilities. Especially exciting were the three hackathons, where I worked for Porsche with Volkswagen AG, Zalando and Adidas, where we could support social entrepreneurs with supply chain transparency. Once one has explored the basics of block chains and transactions, including different consensus methods, it becomes clear what the advantages and disadvantages of the technology are. And also where there are limits. The original blockchain is supposed to make intermediaries unnecessary and distribute the trust ‘censorship free’ fairly among all users, but today’s proof-of-work (PoW) approach devours vast amounts of energy. Even the alternatives have not yet been able to assert themselves. Distributed computing and smart contracts are interesting for companies and process design. However, such a network grows virally if it is ensured that the investment costs are secure in the long term (e.g. through public permissionless systems without PoW). Although most blockchain platform ideas have not yet been implemented and are far from a productive stage and ‘blockchain nowadays mainly runs on PowerPoint’ (citing Ingo Brenckmann) — we already looked at the following technologies. Beside the immutable Ledger of a Blockchain we need for example for the privacy and the data protection (also in the sense of GDPR) also erasable and encrypted data (e.g. with personal data). A blockchain seldom comes alone and needs a distributed file system. Here also Quantum secure encryption plays a big role — this topic we also deal with in 2019. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) also include other methods that are of application-specific interest, such as the ‘Gossip over Gossip’ protocol (e.g. from HashGraph) or decentralized Tangle (e.g. described by Helix). When we think about the future of blockchain applications, Smart Contracts and distributed computing play the most important role. Designed with zero knowledge proofs such as ZK-STARKs and zk-SNARKs in mind, these programs would no longer have to be executed in parallel on all blockchain network participants, but only on a single one — verifiable by the others. Thus, the complexity of the programs can be increased ten thousand times nowadays. And then, in the more distant future, whole applications can run decentrally, so-called dApps. After an intense period of information gathering and testing with prototyping, I was able to share some knowledge in presentations and share it on one or the other panel. Many useful applications can be sorted into one of the categories — but are still at different stages of implementation and deployment. RECORD KEEPING: The protection against data manipulation of any information is an optimal and very feasible task for Blockchain. For this purpose, only the digital fingerprints (e.g. hashes) have to be written on a secure network. (For example for secure video timestamping by my colleague Jagrut Kosti) PAYMENT: In order to bring a payment service to the masses by means of security tokens on blockchain (e.g. into a car, which pays the parking fees itself), you need more price-stable, less volatile cryptocurrencies. This can be done through extremely high market penetration or more likely through government guarantees / regulation. But both can take a long time and are difficult to influence. DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING / SMART CONTRACTS: This creates stable, upwardly compatible interfaces between players / users and companies. SUPPLY CHAIN and PRODUCT LIFECYCLE are a particularly large field of application in this context — this area may also grow together across industries. SECURITY TOKEN: According to studies, the token as a certificate of ownership of real values or representation of a value (e.g. of company shares) will take a heavy toll, but also requires stronger regulation through a clear legislative statement. In 2018 we took the technology apart and learned a lot. This makes it easy to investigate the usefulness and feasibility of use cases.In 2019, it becomes important to focus on the user benefit of blockchain & DLT and to calculate business models for these platforms.After all, you want to see the first real use cases in production. This article presents a personal comment by Claudio. His professional work in the Porsche Digital Lab is research & pre-development of Blockchain and A.I. topics. -- -- #NextLevelGermanEngineering Tech Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text

Toyota Wants to Put a Robot in Every Home and Make It Your Pal,"Android Avatar,Written by Bloomberg"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Bloomberg Follow Bloomberg -- Share By Kevin Buckland Toyota Motor Corp. has sold enough cars to put one outside every Japanese home. Now it wants to put robots inside. Well-known for its automated assembly lines, Toyota sees a not-so-far-off future in which robots transcend the factory and become commonplace in homes, helping with chores — and even offering companionship — in an aging society where a quarter of the population is over 65 and millions of seniors live alone. Machines have become much smarter in the last decade or so. Yet, every attempt to build one that can do simple things like load a washing machine or carry groceries encounters the same basic, physical problem: the stronger a robot gets, the heavier and more dangerous it becomes. What Toyota has going for it are $29 billion in cash reserves, a new artificial intelligence research center and a well-respected inventor, Gill Pratt, heading its effort. “This is a company with so many resources that you can never ignore them,” said Morten Paulsen, a Tokyo-based analyst at CLSA Japan Securities Co., who’s covered the robotics industry for decades. Toyota has been experimenting with robots since at least 2004, when it unveiled a trumpet-playing humanoid with artificial lips, lungs and movable fingers that could accompany an actual human orchestra. Since then research has become more practical. Toyota’s latest android, the T-HR3, is a kind of avatar that can be manipulated remotely via wearable controls, with vision goggles that allow users to see through the machine’s camera-eyes. The device could one day serve as arms and legs for the bedridden, or as a surrogate for relief workers in disaster zones. In 2015 the automaker spent a billion dollars to open its AI-focused Toyota Research Institute in Silicon Valley. Last year it set up a $100 million fund to invest in startups and new robotics technology. This year the company restructured its Partner Robot division to speed decision-making and shorten development time. -- -- Bloomberg Find more like this at bloomberg.com Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*aFLLGsE20mi1mOuO8HH9ug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*rO6YSqzbHG56iNxqAveFYw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1500/1*zS8GYgh77Zzqu7N2rXUHJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*aFLLGsE20mi1mOuO8HH9ug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*rO6YSqzbHG56iNxqAveFYw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*QBfZjRe0uyWvzrOWqunUAg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*aFLLGsE20mi1mOuO8HH9ug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*A8KrgOLTtTeTisOHKxAW2Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*DORJzGYMOG6Pgzao.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*UJrMvAM16lfbHGyEa3OmNw.gif', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*aFLLGsE20mi1mOuO8HH9ug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*Hk-4Q7fe1axiIiPSLyhuVA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*aFLLGsE20mi1mOuO8HH9ug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*niQ0sAwUszuyNMyH.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*pZPMtIONqtJYi2xHYD_Ivg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*r5coQ_IUZNe0yjOH7vq_6w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*-7F-xdEpfDbogXdyl141OQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*nChshyHhYer985FIUWu6TA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*maC8NLpto3tNwluhoRODsw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg']",1-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@bloomberg?source=post_page-----da5c45381448--------------------------------,58,4 min read
Maker Creates a Voice-Operated Camera for a Journalist Who Is Quadriplegic,Written by Cameron Coward," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Cameron Coward Follow -- 1 Listen Share Carolyn Pioro used to be a trapeze performer for a Toronto-based circus. But, in 2005, she was tragically and terribly injured during training when she fell 40 feet and a landed badly on the safety net, severing her spinal cord. With her trapeze career cut short, she enrolled at Centennial College in a contemporary journalism program. She wanted to shoot a photo essay on the performance she loved, but was unable to find an accessible camera option that fit her needs. So, Taras Slawnych stepped in to create one for her. Slawnych is maker, and the visual editor for the Toronto’s Star newspaper. He heard about Pioro’s situation from Star’s photographer Steve Russell, who is a friend of Pioro’s professor Tyler Anderson. Slawnych figured he could come up with a way for Pioro to snap photos, and set out to build it. Because Pioro is quadriplegic, the camera needed to be completely hands free — not only the shutter release, but also panning and tilting. The device Slawnych came up with sits inside a 3D-printed enclosure attached to Pioro’s wheelchair. It takes the 24V battery power from the wheelchair and steps it down to 12V to power the components. Those are an Arduino, servos, and microphone. By interpreting Pioro’s voice commands, the device can pan, tilt, and trigger the camera so she can shoot all the photos she likes on her own. Slawnych even took the device to Canon Canada, who has expressed interest in expanding the design to include zoom functionality. -- -- 1 Author, writer, maker, and a former mechanical designer. www.cameroncoward.com @cameron_coward Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*AvtDIbGG06Ba2ezrFnZcFA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*zu2PVojFF7hyucdZBKjk4Q.gif', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*8_YOyZPmY2Lhloa6m_aPpQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*ds1syNeVhdn9zFrDtNeyaw.gif', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*iuuATCYJjU-RyYN1w6nvHQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*mLi2Lgq45FfZI-NL0OIpUw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*mWDBLCFzn7llTe9sbKV6cQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*niQ0sAwUszuyNMyH.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*pZPMtIONqtJYi2xHYD_Ivg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*-FBZJNyicWLAvPc_vBm8og.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*A5hJ8Np6qJoj0k6ZVgP9SA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*bCfUdj89ZLbPItw6STqBTg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*VWXOGwAskgI1TPehmcx63g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*b4zYnss95wlW-JOhN6VwvQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*5F6PlHIqreKqb7o6', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*NodLEUJwJji9-a7k', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/1*RW-EGZs0FkdKeRz-ot9UOA.gif', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*R9aptJpaxxaqL2xs0Yj4vA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*wX2rxiZLJar6ghuU', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*YcNZQOpFy4RUAj8FAy6p5g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*JeaJWN5uIwe4UqSESIP4Nw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Nvrdu-rvn_wKF2ti6WHbYg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*bJVpBsSmQUV20YBQC2cJkw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*YoiNSW4y6tBe9wcTBt-MeQ.jpeg']",1-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@cameroncoward?source=post_page-----37178db470ea--------------------------------,89,2 min read

TAKASU Masakazu さんに案内していただきました。いつもありがとうございます。訪れたオフィスや工場の皆さま、お忙しい中案内していただきありがとうございました。 まずは日本でも大人気のM5Stackのオフィスへ。CEOのJimmy LaiさんからM5Stackのこれまでの歩みや今後について聞いてきました。 m5stack.com M5Stackは320 x 240 TFTカラーディスプレイ、microSDカードスロット、スピーカーを備えたコンパクトで便利な開発モジュールです。元々 Jimmyさんが自身の開発をサポートするため作ったツールでした。 そのあたりの経緯は越智さんの素晴らしい記事に詳しくまとまってます。そちらを読んでください。 fabcross.jp これまでに作った試作品を見せていただきました。 新プロダクトも見せていただきました。M5StickはM5Stackをより小型にしたプロダクトでオフィスを見せていただいた時はまだ未発売でしたが、オフィス見学の1週間後に発売が開始され、これが深圳スピードかと思いました。 お話が終わったあとに、M5Stackで作ったプロダクトを説明する機会があったので、自分の作ったプロダクトについても軽くデモしてきました。 medium.com Jimmyさん、とても物腰の柔らかくて研究熱心な方でした。僕らのデモや話を聞き漏らさないよう注意深く聞いてて、プロダクトを良くしたいという思いが溢れ出てました。元々 社内開発合宿で使うくらいM5Stackが好きだったけど、短い間でしたがお話を聞いてるうちにJimmyさんの人柄含めてM5Stackのファンになってしまいました。 M5Stackの真に恐ろしいのはユーザーコミュニティがとても充実してるのに、ユーザーコミュニティより本家の利用事例作るスピードの方が速くて、なおかつ毎回クオリティが高いことだと思ってます。今回訪問してみて、ユーザーから上がってきた小さな要望も逃さない姿勢が、今のM5Stackの圧倒的スピード感を産んでるのではと思いました。 お桂园潮豐牛肉へ。一見大味な感じがしたけど、お肉とレタスタレ無しで食べても美味しい。 cn.tripadvisor.com 昼食後はPCBサービスで有名なElecrowへ。 入口の前は絶賛工事中でした。前回深圳に来たときの華強北もこんな感じだったので、おそらくあっという間に驚くほど綺麗になるんだと思いますが、今はすごいところにありました。 Elecrowは有名なPCBサービス以外に、オープンソースのハードウェア製品を販売するオンラインストアを運営したり、あとはSTEAM関連製品を中国および海外向けに提供しています。オフィスではそのあたりの解説をしていただきました。 顧客は米国が20% 1番多いようです。2番目が日本で15%。米国が一番というのはちょっと意外でした。 Elecrowが作ってる製品 CrowPiを見せていただきました。各種センサーの使い方が学べるRaspberry Pi学習キットです。 www.elecrow.com 梱包スペース。ここからいつも商品を送ってるようです。いつもここから送られてきてると考えると感慨深かったです。 Sino:bitもElecrowが製造した製品。製品ギャラリーに飾られてました。 僕はよくElecrowのレーザーカットサービスを使ってるのですが、そちらはこの場所では行ってないようです。残念 www.elecrow.com この日最後はニコ技深圳コミュニティのJenesis工場 オープンデイに参加するためJENESISを訪れました。藤岡さん、お忙しい中工場を見せていただきありがとうございました。 前回訪れた時は別の場所でした。 medium.com 今日本の家電量販店で旋風を巻き起こしてるPOCKETALKの生産ラインを見せていただきました。相変わらず塵1つない、とても綺麗な工場でした。 pocketalk.jp 6日目に続きます。 medium.com -- -- TAKUYA ICHISE 🗻Engineer, Maker 🎥http://youtube.com/@tichise Help Status About Careers

A Social Good Story in the Age of the Opioid Crisis (2018 Recap by Fiduscript),Written by James Lott," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story James Lott Follow DataDrivenInvestor -- Share Wow, 2018 — What a year. In 2017, our work was hardly an idea. We are now months away from launching, and have built a supportive network of amazing colleagues, mentors, advisors, business partners, investors, and most importantly advocates who champion the work our team is doing. We’re tackling the opioid crisis with our flagship service Naloxone Exchange, an online marketplace where anyone can purchase the life-saving opioid antidote Naloxone, receive effective training on how to use it, and have it delivered to their door. In short, this medication is a miracle drug that gives people a second shot at life. In fact, its brand (Narcan) made by Adapt Pharma is the same drug that has revived thousands of people, including celebrity musician Demi Lovato. When 72,000 people die from a preventable condition, smart and thoughtful action needs to be taken. Our company, Fiduscript aims to make it easy for anyone in the United States (from law enforcement to worried parents, and everyone in between) to order Naloxone and have it delivered to their door seamlessly. I’d like to take a few moments to highlight some of the incredible things that happened to us this past year. It all started in January 2018, when I nervously pitched my idea to an audience of business students at the #1 ranked University of Chicago Booth… -- -- DataDrivenInvestor Pharmacist.

北歐創業論壇SLUSH工作人員申請介紹 上篇,"北歐創業論壇SLUSH工作人員申請介紹 下篇,Written by Wes Hsu,[前情提要],[時間表],[申請步驟],[我所分配的工作],[文章中段]"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Wes Hsu Follow Wes Conference Review -- Share SLUSH工作人員申請經驗與論壇參展評論。上半段著重申請流程與時間順序，以及工作現場的實際經歷與反思。下半段則是與參展團體在會場互動的分享和會後的行程建議。合計兩篇總共九千字的文章。 對於SLUSH這個活動已經聽過多年，最早是在台灣的科技雜誌上翻過幾篇報導，不過當時沒有想過在數年後能進入會場親身體驗那幾頁光彩奪目的敘述。在2018年經歷赫爾辛基場的這段旅程後想要分享給更多的朋友，希望對創業、科技或是志工有興趣的朋友能有機會來參與這場盛會。 以下先給大家一個訊息公布的時間表，希望讓第一次申請工作人員的朋友，能降低每天更新信箱郵件匣的憂慮。 8/1 線上申請系統開放 8/6 註冊帳戶提交申請 10/7 線上報名系統截止 10/15 收到第一封組長的來信，詢問可行的Skype面試時間。 10/16 線上面試，並加入小組的WhatsApp群組。收到官方邀請信。 11/9 官方公布合作青年旅館、臉書大會資訊社團與住宿互助社團 11/14 第一封工作人員內部通訊信(Newsletter) 11/17 工作人員培訓日(可選擇參加)，於芬蘭埃斯波(Espoo)。 11/20 公布官方周邊活動(Side Events)。小組的第一次線上會議。 11/24 第二封工作人員內部通訊信，包含工作手冊。 11/27 第三封工作人員內部通訊信，會前訓練注意事項。 12/1 第四封工作人員內部通訊信，大會手機版APP釋出。 12/3 會前訓練與工作人員肖像照拍攝。 12/4 正式會期第一日。 12/5 正式會期第二日。 12/6 芬蘭獨立日。 12/7 國際志工周的新創團隊參訪。 12/8 志工限定會後派對 線上申請系統的資料填寫並不複雜，我相信對大多數的大學生半個小時即可完成，第一頁的基本資料包含，工作經驗與技能、先前志工經驗、語言技能與程度(並不需要附上檢定證明)、教育程度(選填)、專業領域(選填)、有興趣的大會主題(至多選擇三項)，接著，下個頁面是工作人員的申請，可以在三十多個小組選擇自己有興趣申請的團隊加入，我認為申請者需要事先對各組的工作內容有初步了解再勾選，因為這決定會期的工作排班與參展時間，如果排班與想聽的講座時間衝突，會降低預期的與會收穫，因此在下面我舉一些小組的工作性質，提供大家選填志願的參考。此外的問題還有是否願意擔任小組組長、是否能參加十一月的會前訓練、是否需要會期間的住宿等，最後最重要的是自我介紹與參展動機，沒有字數限制，我只用不到一百字表達自己的熱情以及對於會議的高度興趣，就通過了第一階段的書面審查。 超過三十種的工作性質小組，內部其實會在按造數字分成一組約十人，將兩千四百多位志工分配進每個小單位。以下是我在會場有接觸到的志工，因此以他們的工作經驗分享作介紹。 名牌印製小組(Badge Claim Team): 對於講者(Speaker)、與會者(Attendee)、投資者(Investor)與新創團隊(Startup)，進入主會場或是周邊活動前，都需要提供身分證或是護照以領取名牌與活動手環，才能參與後續的活動，工作地點除了會場外，可能會到市區購物中心或是餐館酒吧等周邊場地，工作環境因為需要印表機及筆電，能在溫暖的室內輪班。 講者接待小組(Slush Buddies Team): 需要與講者頻繁信件往來，安排接機或是市區交通的協助，是個很好的機會能與台上的產業先驅近距離接觸，如果講者在會後提前離開，志工在會期的工作量與時間並不長。 餐飲服務小組(Catering Team): 會場四處都設有杯水服務站，甚至可以選擇氣泡水，而遞水的工作就是由他們負責。對於想聽演講與參展的朋友並不理想，因為值班時間大多在會期進行時間。 衣帽間服務小組(Cloakroom Team): 會場的南北出口各設有衣帽架的大型場地，負責對於大衣以及背包標號存放與送回的工作，標籤是使用回收的纖維再製，是主辦方所講求的永續選擇。 派對支援小組(Parties Team): 在派對的飲品攤位負責取酒與開瓶的工作，活動結束後也一同回收瓶罐。其他組別也有負責檢查活動手環及發放酒券等工作。 周邊商品小組(Store Team): 會場一隅有官方的服飾如連帽長袖或是提袋與毛帽等商品，在紫外燈的照射下散發螢光，負責介紹產品特色與挑選尺寸。 永續回收小組(Sustainability Team): 現場設置大量的分類回收桶，永續志工的工作是引導與會者投入正確的桶子，一個我認為相當辛苦的職位。 志工區域小組(Volunteer Area Team): 在志工休息區有零食、水果、咖啡與氣泡飲料等簡單的食物可以領取，補貨與清潔桌面的工作是他們所執行。 第二階段的線上面試也不需要給自己太大的壓力，我自身的經驗是約十分鐘的談話，而話題涵蓋基本的自我介紹以及對於工作的想像與期待只占了一半，剩下的一半其實是組長簡介接下來一個多月的工作行程安排，還有確認組員能夠配合的時間。若是與自身預期有落差，都可以向組長提出，組員的調動是非常正常而且頻繁的。我雖然在十月就進入通訊群組，但直到十一月中我們這組的名單才更改成活動當天所呈現的人員。也因此，在收到罐頭拒絕信的當下並不要太氣餒，我有其他台灣志工朋友的經驗是11/9當天收到官方拒絕信後，約一周後的11/15又接到錄取通知信，我想是部分小組有組員退出，因此候補上先前刷掉的人選。 小結申請成功的要素，除了己身的服務熱忱外，我認為申請的時間也是一個考量的因素，高達兩千四百人的志工團隊，篩選的流程難以等到報名截止後才開始，提前送出申請使得更多的時間讓小組組長選入自己的組別。而我這次在系統開放第一周即提交申請，比起截止日提早了兩個月，希望有興趣的大家在明年也能在時間上取得一點申請優勢。 很幸運的我被選入派對支援小組，更讓其他志工羨慕的是我們這組的排班時間是在會期前一天與會期第一天的晚上時段，下午五點到凌晨三點的時間。因此在主場館的講座時間能夠讓我們自由運用，會期第二天的會後派對也不需要值班，可以跟與會者一樣享受到會場的獨特氣氛。此外工作地點與內容與其他派對支援組別並不太一樣，我們的工作場所都在市區的酒吧餐館，也不需要開瓶開罐遞飲料，而主要是查對訪客的邀請名單。組內總共有九個成員，一半都是芬蘭當地的學生，其餘來自國家有瑞典、印度、印尼與奈及利亞，不過大多目前都在北歐念書或是待業。 第一天的工作地點是在市區的創辦人大街(Founders Street, Kalevankatu)，街道兩旁餐館與酒吧林立，為了讓活動地點更加醒目，路中央有設置一個透明的管狀小空間，裡面有幾個小吧檯，幾盞強烈的暖氣燈，最重要的是DJ台，不過音響其實是置於室外，也就是在大街上撥放著派對樂曲，讓與會者路過街道小巷時不會錯過，同時我們也看到很多長者在經過音響時面帶嫌惡摀著耳朵快步通過。派對活動開始前，我們在名叫老學生浩室(Old student House)的展演舞台負責場佈如掛布條及綁彩帶等簡單工作，專業的燈光調控與環境音響系統則是其他廠商所包辦。活動期間，我們負責查對邀請名單，並發予特製單向手環，讓受邀訪客可以自由進出二樓貴賓休息室。同時在場地輪班的志工還有名牌印製小組，相比之下，他們的工作量比我們大的多。第一天排班時間較短，在午夜十二點前下崗，這時身上的志工名牌基本上是各個派對的通行證，但事實上我們都是滑開手機找尋最近一班開往青旅的巴士，然後刷著主辦單位發的交通卡快速返家，為了第一天會期上午十點的開幕表演。 第二天的工作地點則換到了市區外圍Kallio區的知名複合式酒吧，內部有三個主要的舞池還有一個樂團表演的舞台，而因為是邀請限定的派對，我們的工作比昨天繁重的多，需要一一查對訪客的名牌或是身分證，從兩千多個受邀賓客表單中尋找對應名字，而因為場地限制，我們的檢查點設在室外的棚架座位區，也就是在芬蘭十二月天與凜冽寒風併肩工作。 從十點開始訪客陸續湧入，最理想的查對情境是出示的名牌完全符合表單上的名字與身份，如講者、與會者或是投資者，次之的是出示身分證或是其他姓名的證明，最複雜的情況是輸入各種名字反覆搜尋之後，仍然無法顯示搜尋結果。若是第一個條件成立，我們接著引導賓客前往衣帽間並領取活動限定的單向手環，附加一個大大的微笑歡迎他們的到來；若是最後一種情況發生，往往需要解釋這個派對的性質，而我們也常得到不下十種的原因回覆，像是”我朋友轉寄了活動邀請”、”我公司的執行長已經進去派對場地等我們了”，或是”我代替有事無法前往的朋友來參加等等”。不過這些都不及無法勸阻，繼續在入口棚子下徘徊的群眾，此時與我們一起排班的近十位警衛工作量即呈現指數上升，需要清楚指明出口的方向來減緩壅塞的人流壓力。一直到凌晨兩點排隊人潮大幅減少，先前進場的賓客也漸漸離場，我們才結束這晚的值班任務。 過程中也遇到許多不耐煩的客人越過排隊隊伍，在柵欄前大聲嚷嚷，稱自己是受邀貴賓，要求快速通關的閘門，但後果可想而知，一樣被警衛請到隊伍最後面重新排隊。我也甚至遇過不在名單上的投資客，想要使用眼神脅迫施壓，甚至指著我的志工名牌，面帶不悅得說我記住你了之類的威脅語句，並在場外來回踱步了兩三圈才離去。雖然當下會猶豫自己到底要得罪幾十位北歐創業圈的投資客，但在一兩周後回想這些小顛簸，我認為只敢對付底層第一線工作人員的人格特質，也不適合成為未來的合作夥伴或是股東對象，對於當晚的試圖衝撞進入派對的人士也就少了一點愧疚感。與志工合作的警衛們，都是受過專業訓練、身著制服，可靠可信賴的彪形夥伴，必要時也建議我們遇到不符合名單的客人時只要舉手就好，他們會幫我們處理後續的解釋等工作，是我們特別感謝的搭檔，也是整場活動重要的工作之一。 以上是志工申請的步驟介紹與一些心得，我會在下一篇繼續介紹會場的演講與體驗，還有在赫爾辛基的參訪與行程安排，希望大家能在北歐的寒冬中度過暖暖充實的一周。北歐創業論壇SLUSH工作人員申請介紹 下篇。 medium.com -- -- Wes Conference Review A columnist based in Baltics.

2018 in Review: A year of more wins,"SV-NED Holds Graduation Ceremony For Immersion Participants | Independent Newspapers Nigeria,Vodacom launches annual Interschool Robotics Training - Vodacom Nigeria,Written by Ezekiel Adeyinka,Silicon Valley- Nigeria Economic Inc(SV-NED).,InvenTech,Competitions,Tech Trainings and Facilitations,Specially invited programs,TECH CONFERENCES,Life,2019: What’s the Plan?"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Ezekiel Adeyinka Follow -- 1 Listen Share The year 2018 was super amazing for me with more wins and achievement and I have a couple of things am Grateful for. Just like in 2017, I have probably grown and achieved more myself and with the different set of amazing people I came in contact with. In the year 2018, I learnt a lot more in business and tech understanding how both go hand in hand, worked with an amazing team in building a world-class product, learnt teamwork and collaboration, attended both local and International conferences, had the privilege to participate in different competitions, Hackathons and Product Exhibitions. I’ll love to share a review of how my year went and the things I was involved in, to realize how far I have come and how much I need to contribute to making a difference. Establishing a strategic, bilateral Technology and economic relationship between Silicon Valley and Nigeria. Early this year, I had the privilege to get in to participate in an Intensive 2nd immersion program training into Silicon Valley’s culture of innovation and entrepreneurship in areas of Artificial Intelligence, Business Intelligence, IoT, Block-chain, Start-Ups, Cloud Computing and much more. The training was hosted by SV-NED Inc and participating companies from Silicon Valley including Oracle Africa, IBM Nigeria, HP Africa and General Electric. Also, I was trained by a Stanford University Emeritus Professor( Dr. Sam Haddad), an Angel Investor from Mexico( Silicon Valley Miguel Casillas), An Advanced Cyber-security solution strategist from Cisco( Sam Washington), a Professor from New-York State University, top engineers and experts from IBM, Oracle, General Electric and HP. The training and lectures lasted for days and I had the opportunity to visit IBM, Oracle, HP office and made use of their facilities. After the rigorous training and exposures, I had my final Online technical examination at the GTI Nigerian stock exchange trading floor. The exam was marked and graded by Silicon Valley experts and after a couple of days the final result came out. To the glory of God, I came out first position with a perfect score of 100%. I was very happy I made such achievement and I give God all the glory. I got an Award from HP Africa and From SV-NED Inc. Thanks to everyone that celebrated with me. After, I became part of the founding team of folks who started SV-NED Inc Lagos Incubator, Lekki and I served as Technical Director facilitating training and lectures for young talents, Entrepreneurs and start-up owners in current technologies. It was such an amazing opportunity and experience. After, I had the opportunity to participate various programs like SV-NED and HP Africa Got’s talent in Info-Tech challenge, IBM Africa Innovation challenge were I did very well in both and I came out top. I was later awarded with a merit award certificate and golden medal by the CEO/Co-Founder of SV-NED Inc. Chief Temitope Ajayi. I sincerely want to thank her and appreciate her for given me such privilege, for her motherly love and care. Thanks to Our SV-NED president, Ms Dennis Williams and my Project Director, Maxwell. I later appeared on the Nigeria Independence Newspaper featuring SV-NED Inc. www.independent.ng I give God all the Glory and i thank everyone involved for such opportunity and privilege. Our mission is to empower people with the ability to do more with technology. I joined an amazingly fast-growing startup company at the Obafemi Awolowo University, called InvenTech. We are a team of hardware, software and business engineers were we are building a web-based drag and drop platform that gives you a new way to program, control and monitor microcontrollers using IoT at its core and also we have a hardware product called InventOne board( a microcontroller that’s made in Nigeria by Nigerians). I bet you it’s better than other Micro-controllers out there. We had a lot of achievements this year as a company. We got the opportunity to exhibit and showcase our products at Techpoint Inspired, the largest tech conference in West Africa in May, with close to over 1000 tech experts and enthusiasts coming to check out our platform. It was really overwhelming seeing how people came around to our stand loving what we’ve built. Later we go interviewed and featured by Techpoint crew because they also loved our products. Weeks later, we got an invite by HP Africa courtesy SV-NED inc and we had the chance to pitch our platform to HP Africa Top executives. We also had a training seminar at the Electrical and Electronics Department, OAU were Professors, Lecturers, and students came to learn more about our invention and learnt how to use it. Months later we were invited to train students and lecturers of the Computer science department, Federal College of Animal Health and Production Technology, Ibadan on IoT using our Lab and InventOne board. I got an Invite from Google to represent InvenTech at the Google Developers Agency program. The goal of the program is to help upskill and promote top Nigerian software development companies leveraging on Google’s Technologies. The program was a full day technical event with tech talks and product reviews. Thanks to Victor Shoaga and Ayomide Bakare and other amazing InvenTech folks for us all working together to attain a Vision. More accomplishment and greater height for us in 2019. Student Innovation Challenge 2018(SIC) Around June, I and one my Colleague(from Team RTS) got selected for a Federal Government Competition called Student Innovation Challenge 2018. We represented Obafemi Awolowo University alongside with other universities and polytechnics across Nigeria. It was a platform to pitch the innovative project that we are working on to a panel of judges selected from different subsectors and industries across the country. What we are working on is a Robotics Gaming platform using AI and Computer Vision. We won at the South-West Regionals held at the University of Lagos. The competition is still ongoing at other regions of the country. Thanks to iQube Labs for giving such opportunity to learn and work on such an amazing project. I had the opportunity to meet with and take pictures with the Vice president of Nigeria, Prof.Yemi Osinbanjo and also had a Presidential Handshake. Later we got featured on the competition official website and on various social media platforms. Code with me Was an Intensive 3 weeks boot camp training I helped facilitated and organized for students new to programming at OAU. The areas of training include: Android development, Website developments and Hardware using C++. I was part of the tutor who trained students on Web Development- Front End. The students later built their personal portfolio website at the end of the training. Google I/O Extended, OAU I helped facilitated and organized the Google I/O Extended 2018 event with other students Organizers. The program is an annual developer conference held by GDG OAU that brings students, developers and Tech enthusiasts around Obafemi Awolowo University Ile-Ife community for talks and Hands-on learning and technical code labs on flutter, machine learning, cloud and Android. The event is to recreate the experience at the last Google I/O 2018 held by Google in Mountain view. IEEE OAU This year I was appointed as the Technical Director and Assistant PRO for the Student Body. I helped facilitated and Organized 2018 IEEE Xtreme Global programming competition. OAU came first across Nigeria this year again. Embedded AI by Intel OAU student community I was part of the amazing team behind Embedded AI by Intel OAU. It was a one-day expository program on the Internet of Things(IoT) and Artificial Intelligence(AI) were exciting developments and tools around AI and IoT from Intel were discussed. There was a two training session, Exhibition and idea hackathon held on Intel technologies regarding IoT and AI respectively. UTSSA HARDWARE HACKATHON (http://utssa.oauife.edu.ng/) It was a one-week intensive Hardware training on Embedded system and Microcontrollers were students are to learning and come up with inventions that can solve problems in Nigeria.

"Online Communities — Part 2: Prerequisites, scaling, and some great examples.","When the scale starts breaking,Wikipedia,Rajneeshpuram,In the next part…,Written by Eylon Aviv,Successful communities,To conclude"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Eylon Aviv Follow DataDrivenInvestor -- Listen Share In the previous article, we talked about what is a community. But just like Rome, or any other city for that matter, communities are not built in a day. It’s a process that usually requires a hard, concentrated, and extended effort from a single or a small group of people. The keys to a successful community Have you ever wondered why some communities succeed long-term and some don’t, why do they break and what makes people leave them? I’ve researched what are some characteristics and prerequisites for creating successful online communities. There are many categories and subcategories and a lot of literature. Stan Garfield, the legendary Community evangelist has done extensive research on this and according to him, these are 3 keys to communities of practice. The first two points are clear — you need a common topic of interest that the members of the community share, and you need enough people to create that community. Let's focus on the third. Communities require a leader, there is no way for a community to form without one or a few leaders that invest time and effort into building it, creating content, and setting the path and values for the community and its future members. Also, social media seems to have allowed us to surpass Dunbar’s number of up to 200 stable relationships, or has it? What happens if/when the community grows? Big communities can become a source of power — from organizing movements of change to purchasing power and buying syndicates, all the way to buying a castle together. The Leader or the person who started the community now finds himself with more and more power. More often than not the leader realizes his power — “I built this community, this community is mine, and I decide what happens to it.” But wait, how can one person own the community, how can one person decide? What about joint ownership, isn’t that community? As communities grow, their purpose and objective grow with them. Pivots and shifts in the direction of the community can be quite drastic from where the community started from. What happens when there’s a disagreement between the community members and the leader regarding these shifts? Let's play a thought experiment. Tomorrow, your community present you with a signed petition of over 60% members. There, they request you to relinquish your admin-ship and pass the baton to someone else. Will you do as they request, or stick to your guns? What about other cases where the leader no longer serves the community or forces his agenda. Maybe he grew tired of the community and doesn’t want to manage it anymore. Or maybe he decides to monetize it. From running ads at the expense of the members, silencing people who think differently or oppose them, and all the way to selling the group. As Cyndi Lauper taught us back in the 80s, Dan Ariely at Burning man, or countless articles, songs, and experiments — we change when faced with money. Another thought experiment — Someone offers you a million dollars to sell your community, to use at their discretion. This is not ‘never work again in your life money’ but it is a lump sum. Some of you are community managers, right? What would you do? (If you decide to give it to your community of 10,000 members each will get $100) Communities are dependent on their leaders to run them justly and not to succumb to temptations of personal gain — power, money, or status. In the process of scaling online communities, the leaders are the single point of failure. How do you get past this hurdle? What are examples of communities and online communities that have really managed to grow, thrive, and scale? How did the leaders of the community who are essential to its formation acted? What did they do differently? To get a clue lets explore some of the successful communities that have survived the tests of time. On October 27th, 2001, Jimmy Wales created Wikipedia, which will later become the first online distributed community. These are statements of principles, emphasizing openness, open source, and neutral point of view which have guided the Wikipedia community over the years. Imagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. that’s our commitment. — Wikimedia foundation Satement One of those principals is: Newcomers are always to be welcomed. There must be no cabal, there must be no elites, there must be no hierarchy or structure which gets in the way of this openness to newcomers …. so that people are automatically given full privileges once they have been around the community for a very short period of time.” Anyone is welcome to join and after a short process, you are an equal member and contributor in the community. — Joint Ownership. Wikipedia is now in the top #5 most visited websites in the world, with Google, Youtube, Facebook, and Baidu preceding it —consequently, these are some of the richest companies in the world, led by the richest entrepreneurs. Jimmy has got to be one of the richest people in the world right? Well no, his net worth is estimated at a bit over $1 Million. As some of you may know Wikipedia is non-profit, it’s run by the community, for the community. Had it been for profit, had there been a personal incentive to build Jimmy Wales’ company? Do you think people would contribute to Wikipedia? To someone else’s wealth? I think Jimmy realized that the only way for Wikipedia to fulfill it’s potential and become the sum of all knowledge it has to be a true community, jointly owned by its users and free of any personal gain. Wikipedia is first and foremost an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language. Asking whether the community comes before or after this goal is really asking the wrong question: the entire purpose of the community is precisely this goal . — Jimmy “Jimbo” Wales Bitcoin Bitcoin is a social phenomenon backed by mathematics. I don’t think anyone can argue about the strength of the Bitcoin community, after more than 330 obituaries and counting, it still exists and continues to create headlines. The stronger the social connections in that community, the stronger Bitcoin will be. Why are people a part of the Bitcoin community? On the surface, it’s speculation and monetary gain. People buy bitcoin because they speculate that it will go up in value. But a lot of those, myself included, stayed for more than that. From Austrian economic views, the excessive power of banks, and economic equality. The fundamentals of Bitcoin are exactly the same of a Community — Joint ownership enforced by the protocol. Satoshi Nakamoto designed a system that assumes selfish behavior and ensures that the only way to move forward is through collaboration and participation. He also understood that If he really wants Bitcoin to scale and fulfill its potential, which will be uncovered in the coming years, he has to remove himself from it. Perhaps taking lessons from Jimmy and Wikipedia. About a year ago, Satoshi Nakamoto was ranked among the 50 richest people in the world as noted Quartz. Oh man, could you imagine? Immeasurable wealth at the palm of your hands, and yet we don’t know who he is and none of his funds have been moved, Satoshi, just like Jimmy, gave up personal gain for the success of the community. In the early 1980s followers of who would later be named Osho, erected a full city that housed over 7,000 people, an airport, hotel, and even an artificial lake. Check out the Netflix documentary — Wild wild country I can’t recommend it enough. It really shows what a community can build and do if they have a shared goal/something in common and they feel joint ownership. By all measures, Rajneeshpuram was a successful community that accomplished incredible deeds. Eventually, though, both leaders, Shiela and Bhagwan, became corrupt, stopped serving their community and instead lead it to pursue their personal interests, and thus the community broke down. Such is the fate of communities with powerful leaders that fall for personal incentives. There are many other examples which I did not include. For example, the fundamentals of religion are also based on such things. But they are piled with layers of personal interest and gain which have tainted the base layer of spirituality, which I think is an important part of the human experience. While leaders are vital to the formation of the community if the community is to scale and reach its potential that leader(s) has to remove himself from omnipotence, forfeit power, and allow the community to take charge. When there is no single point of authority, power, or ownership when members of the community feel equal and the power to influence the community through action, contribution, and collaboration, that is a true community. With the connection opportunities of the internet such decentralized communities, like Wikipedia and Bitcoin, can grow into world-changing movements, improving the lives of their participants, contributors, and even ‘lurkers’ — most people just use Wikipedia, they don’t contribute. What other communities can be built? The possibilities are endless and our imagination is the only limit. We will talk about why does this happen, anthropologically and philosophically. Why do positions of power change human behavior, and what can we do to change that? The clue lies in the last of the five good emperors, Marcus Aurelius, a personal exemplar of mine. The most powerful person during his time and yet a just and righteous leader. Shane Parrish’s has a superb introduction to him Hi there, My name is Eylon, If you like the nonsense that I write, give me a few (50!) claps and follow me! I’m designing and building a different type of social media, guided by values of security & privacy, where users are not the product, social validation is gained for collaboration, and the users own the platform. Thinking too big? Probably. You can help me by clapping and following me. Want to hear more? help? collaborate?

Robot Demo to the Prime Minister,1. YOU!,Written by Erin RobotGrrl"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Erin RobotGrrl Follow RobotMissions -- Listen Share Hello robot friends! It has been an action packed year for Robot Missions to say the least! From meeting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, to having 100 participants be part of our Season Finale Field Test, to the progress on the robots functioning autonomously and with artificial intelligence. This will be a year to remember. Not only in the progress made, but in the ways we witnessed the community rally together to help support our cause and make the vision a reality. What we accomplished this year was made possible in large part because of the support of the community. I’ve always envisioned Robot Missions as a huge mountain that one desires to reach the summit of. Since the journey is a crucial part of the adventure, then the only legitimate way to reach the peak is to just keep climbing upwards. And we’ve made a few steps forward this year. At this vantage point, it is a privilege to see the steps that helped us reach this far. Going through the year might not have felt successful at times — perhaps more like drowning during portions of it. By partially emerging to take pause and look back, it’s evident that this year we’ve made a significant leap forwards in the big dream of Robot Missions. Of course, there were mistakes and missteps made along the way. Undoubtedly, there were also sad moments this year. We will learn from these and strive to improve in 2019. We’re fortunate that it was difficult to narrow down this list to only 10 moments. With that said, here are the top 10 Robot Missions moments of 2018: This is what really spring-boarded it all. Being able to work for three weeks on Robot Missions un-distracted at MadeMill allowed us to dream about what can be possible. At MadeMill, it was a one of its kind environment where you are surrounded with many cool resources in the form of fabrication tools and knowledgable experts. We learned more, and experimented with waterjet cutting metal pieces for the robot. Using this tech, we made wheels that were much bigger than what would have been feasible on our smaller 3D printer. The experience culminated in running a Robo-Obstacle course at the Canadian Science and Technology Museum, with two robots that were operational! Luckily from this three week experience, I was invited to join the team as an electronics designer. Without a doubt, this significantly changed the orbit of Robot Missions — opening many new amazing possibilities and opportunities. Incredibly thankful for this. Engaging with stakeholders through demonstrations, presentations, and more — It’s such an honour when important people lend their time to hear about what we are working on with Robot Missions. Even more significant, is when that person helps champion your initiative. One shining example of this was with Councillor Jeff Leiper, who helped with getting the approval for our initiative to take place on Westboro Beach in the summer, and joined in many times during the summer when we were working on the project and robots. We couldn’t have asked for a better person to help with this! Additional highlights include meeting Minister Kirsty Duncan, Minister Catherine McKenna, Mayor Jim Watson, winning an Awesome Foundation award, presenting at the Innovators and Entrepreneurs series at SDTC, being highlighted during the uOttawa Women in Tech event and meeting the VP of Amazon AWS, and more. Plus, a fond memory of when Megan Smith gave a shoutout to Robot Missions during her keynote at OCE Discovery. All of these give more awareness to Robot Missions, which helps us broaden our reach — so we very much appreciate it. To start off, we weren’t entirely sure that this would or would not be possible. For the Hackaday Supercon in Pasadena, CA, we asked attendees ahead of time if they have a 3D printer and if they could print some robot parts to replicate a Bowie robot. It was really amazing that there were people who were willing to contribute print time and filament to the build! On the Friday, the build started, and continued throughout Saturday. Time management could have probably been better. This was all leading up to the workshop, similar to a Field Test, which was on Sunday. With the help of volunteers at Supercon with assembling the robot, we were able to get the robot going just in the nick of time with 30 minutes to spare! The workshop, Environmental Robotics BioBlitz was attended by a dozen or so hardware hackers who are also interested in tackling environmental challenges. The Hackaday Supercon provided a great place to test this crowd-sourced build, and test the robot. Bowie was able to pick up a chip bag! A big thank you to everyone who helped out to make this possible! Working with the University of Ottawa introduction to engineering design class students for two semesters has been interesting! It’s really amazing to provide the robot as a platform to the students, and see what they would develop as modules to tackle an environmental challenge or to improve the capability of the robot. The groups that were able to do multiple prototype iterations in the semester developed functional modules. It was impressive for a first year class. In the first semester one group decided to tackle water sampling with Bowie. The module they made was great, and functioned to collect three individual water samples. The following semester, one group decided to tackle the challenge of making Bowie into a water skimmer. They made an area for Bowie to ‘sit’ on a buoyant platform (which also used recycled 2L pop bottles). This shows that the students did build on each others work, as the project in the first semester could be used by the project in the second semester. The idea worked! These were just two of the several interesting projects that helped push the functionality forwards. Many thanks to University of Ottawa for helping the students collaborate with Robot Missions! There was a lot of work put in to coding the robots and upgrading them this season. We managed to have three robots working, each of them with their own specialty. We were able to get 3D printed tank treads rolling on the robot — though to our surprise they ended up working better just rolling on the sprockets! For navigating autonomously, we encountered difficulties using the standard GPS + IMU approach on the sandy terrain. This meant it was necessary to change the approach! We went with using augmented reality markers, where the robot could visually detect the marker and navigate within a square. We got Tensorflow up and running on the Raspberry Pi, trained the dataset, and were able to get three sub-systems to talk to each other in order for the robot to successfully scoop when it detected debris. Wow! We had imagined this, and now this year an early version of it became reality. Also, who can forget when we modified Bowie to be able to apply lipstick?! This one is still secret, but you’ll hear about this in the new year! ;) Deploying the Pod onto Westboro Beach was a dream come true. An off-grid solar powered work station to serve as the Robot Missions HQ during the summer. This was made possible thanks to prototypeD Team. They put in the hard work to make the design, construct it, and fit it up so it looked stellar on the interior. Thanks to them for allowing us to use the Pod and paint it purple. The Pod was a beacon when we were on the beach. Folks on the beach would come up to ask if we were selling ice cream or surfboards? Nope. :D This is mission control centre to the beach cleaning robots! Good times were had painting it purple (even Councillor Jeff Leiper stopped by to lend a hand and his painting expertise!), spray painting the designs, the installation, and working inside of it during the summer. We wish it was still here with us today. I miss it. It would have been cool to put lights on it for the holidays. The fond experiences of it on the beach and working on the robots inside keep its memory alive. It was so humbling to see participants join us on a beautiful day for our season finale Field Test and celebrate the progress made during the summer. Considering the start of the season Field Test was in pouring rain (a handful of people did come out to this, which was amazing), this was a fitting finish! We had all three robots operating, did a few demonstrations of the AI, and discussed with people the progress made and what some of the current limitations are. This was a blast, and thank you to everyone who joined in, it was wonderful to see folks come again who visited previously in the summer, and meet folks who were new to the initiative! Wow, this was such an honour to meet Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and share Robot Missions with him. During the demonstration, Yellow Bowie scooped up a crumpled paper ball on the floor (representing trash) and opened its lid to deposit it into the hopper. It was quite the feeling to see everyone applaud when this happened! Afterwards, the Prime Minister even drove the robot! Hearing how he was aware that 3D printing was ubiquitous was fantastic. It is a great highlight, especially as an inventor, to have your project recognised. This helps introduce Robot Missions to a national stage now, and strengthens the recognition as an initiative. I personally don’t think I will forget this for a million years. Thank you to those who made this possible, namely MadeMill for featuring us. Participants, the team, people who helped with workshops and Field Tests, and valuable mentors and advisors. You’re the motivation that keeps us going. We’ve met many of you through the Field Tests this summer, and it has been a pleasure to share the robots with you (even when the robots were being difficult). It’s amazing when you get to hear tidbits of the initiative from other people — one we heard was that the robots on the beach was the ‘sensation of the summer’. I still can’t believe that at the Westboro Beach closing, we had people lining up to play with the robot! We used every last volt possible in the batteries that evening. :) It really means a lot that the community enjoyed our project! We aim to make an impact in the community and the local environment with robots. The critical bit is all of you — and without, this would simply not be possible. As well, a personal big thank you to those who have been generous with their time to mentor and advise. Shoutout to my mentors Leah L, Chris B, Jason A, Olivia P, Andrew P, Brenda B — you’ve helped more than you would know. The learning opportunities have been tremendous and have been endowed through your guidance. Thank you!! Bonus — Weirdest item Bowie collected: half of a pair of dentures! We’re still wrapping up some items from 2018, as the to-do list is still quite long… this includes an avalanche of email replies and thank you notes to do (sorry). It was really a wildly interesting year, though this list only gives look at one side, there were many learning opportunities along the way. Again, thank you to everyone who helped make this year a success! We’re looking forward to what we will be doing in 2019, though it might be different.

"Have Data, Want Impact",Written by Ryan den Rooijen," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Ryan den Rooijen Follow -- 1 Listen Share Organisations and individuals alike are realising that data — their data — has value. While data literacy has a long way to go, this is an important first step. Judicious use of analytics can have a significant positive impact on individuals’ lives: think of better energy management, increased financial security, and improved medical decisions, to name just a few. On a societal level it can help mitigate environmental degradation, improve allocation of tax revenues, and define better policies and treaties, increasing overall happiness, transparency, and welfare. Analytics can simplify complexity. If you’re wondering why it doesn’t feel like these benefits are being realised, well, you’re not the only one. There are likely two factors at play here. Firstly, we have difficulty at times recognising progress, instead amplifying the negative news while sidelining positive developments. If you’re interested in overcoming this bias I’d recommend Factfulness, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Annual Letters, and the New York Times’ Week in Good News. The second factor is simpler: humans aren’t doing a great job yet at unlocking the promise of data, analytics, and AI. In certain areas we have seen an almost magical level of progress, e.g. machine translation and complex board games. However, in others we are only in our infancy, and many organisations are not realising the value they could, both due to technical and behavioural hurdles. The question therefore is this: how can we move from simply having data to using it to deliver positive impact, and reducing the time it takes us to do so? I’m fortunate to have benefited greatly from my peers’ experiences, and I’m aiming to return the favour by sharing some of mine, starting this year. I’ll look to cover topics such as the data analytics ecosystem, hackathons & design thinking, practical AI applications, diversity & talent development, and organisational design. Suggestions or questions are always very welcome. May I end by wishing you a happy, healthy, and prosperous New Year! — Ryan -- -- 1 This blog has now moved to: https://Qstar.ai/ See you there :) Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*LkoGE9SHCNaueTY1rU7yjA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*y8H0fFj6ltaMibAVinGfIg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*Tm26YLc9if4qBTew4rq6_g.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*LkoGE9SHCNaueTY1rU7yjA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*w0IMiE7bKz5_xz_8ns__Ow.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LkoGE9SHCNaueTY1rU7yjA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*YR3neInQJJnh6JrDLv0gSg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LkoGE9SHCNaueTY1rU7yjA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*P9xrFA1O228owtnKd1E3iQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LkoGE9SHCNaueTY1rU7yjA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*__gSnTizLk2jaHeyuKAMBw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LkoGE9SHCNaueTY1rU7yjA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*I7hSQEbAX39HswwARzgQVA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*blT0wi3FBRI4UTOl09XMWw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*XrdEwtLcBDWMDKJpG8e6Fw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*8VQM4mezIfuyG2u247MzOw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*vzu3JPzaq2EZKTZNY9BhLA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*lEmL62oZdrOOWIzAAFKiFg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*i2zLIwC9mftamP1dbciCeQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*TQlEMeYwwWc38Wqm7EfCTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*0-N4JrXpZG1KJfIrAutd3A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*RQyaV7vEKLi7npX8TXW-Aw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*9IKlJavI2QSn7CpKVee5uA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg']",1-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@denrooijen?source=post_page-----35899cb60d03--------------------------------,47,2 min read
Netflix Pulls Subscriptions from iOS Bypassing Apple Tax,Written by Glen Whillier," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Glen Whillier Follow DataDrivenInvestor -- 1 Listen Share In early 2018 Netflix pulled the option to subscribe to their service through the Google Play store in order to bypass the share that Google takes of subscriptions. The decision left many assuming that the same fate would await their iOS app and indeed as 2018 ended so to did the option of subscribing to Netflix through the Apple App Store. “We no longer support iTunes as a method of payment for new members,” a Netflix spokesperson told VentureBeat. This comes after many developers have voiced their upset over the percentage both Apple and Google take of any in-app purchase. Both companies used to take 30% but in more recent years cut that figure to 15%. Still tensions have remained high between developers and the two tech giants. Netflix isn’t the first company to do this, it’s one of many. Spotify pulled the option to subscribe in-app on iOS. Amazon limits movie and tv-show rentals through Prime Video to its website; Purchasing Kindle books isn’t available through their Kindle app either. Epic Games opted to release Fortnite on Android purposely not on the Google Play store to avoid Google taking a cut on in-game purchases. So just how much are companies like Apple and Google profiting off of these subscriptions? Netflix on iOS was grossing approximately $2.4 million a day in 2018, Apple’s cut would be around $700,000 of that figure. According to Sensor Tower, to date Netflix has generated $1.5 billion in in-app subscriptions, meaning Apple took home a comfortable $450 million+. It’s not entirely surprising why these companies are opting for the less user-friendly options and it also makes you wonder whether any other apps on the top-grossing list will consider making the jump.

The ABC of Tech You Must Know in 2019,"AI, blockchain, and community — in the new year, it is time to become exponential-tech literate.,A for “AI goes enterprise”,B for “Blockchain is not going away”,C for “Community is making technology come home”,Written by Tim Leberecht"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Tim Leberecht Follow Predict -- Listen Share When I read about the tech trend predictions for 2019, I feel a strong sense of déjà vu. So many of them sound exactly like the future we envisioned five years ago. Big data is big business. AI is the new electricity, and smart machine learning algorithms will empower consumers, personalize their experience, and enable better decision-making. Self-driving vehicles will make mobility safer and more energy-efficient. Automation will cost jobs but also free many of us to pursue work that is purposeful and fulfilling. “Moonshot thinking,” combined with a Silicon Valley-style fail-fast culture, is the panacea to transforming organizations and entire societies. Human-centered design is the key to doing this in the most humane fashion. And eventually transhumanism will merge human and machine anyway and produce performances at unprecedented level, including achieving immortality. Sound familiar? This future fatigue is not the fault of futurists–they are just reading the tea leaves in their cups. But obviously, the future is not just unevenly distributed, it is also taking a really long time to arrive. Incrementalism is the new disruption, and pragmatism the new moonshot. In this spirit, here are three tech trends that are not groundbreaking but may make or break your business in 2019. If you aren’t yet, this will be the year in which you ought to become exponential-tech-literate. Here’s the new ABC that you must master: By 2030, AI is projected to generate an estimated $13 trillion of GDP growth. In 2019, AI is going to penetrate the enterprise as an indispensable, mission-critical capability. The question is no longer, what tasks do you perform with AI but which tasks do you not? Supporting this line of thinking, a recently published research report by the MIT Sloan Management Review and The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) claims that AI is “becoming real”– advanced by a cohort of Fortune 500 firms beyond the usual AI-alphas Alphabet, Baidu, Facebook, and Microsoft. While many firms have dipped their toes in AI and recognized it as a key strategic challenge, only a few have actually devised, let alone implemented, a comprehensive AI strategy. Among them are Chevron, Mayo Clinic, and Pfizer. Identified as “pioneers” by the study, these firms were early adopters of AI, and they are now doubling down on their investment and seeking to scale it beyond sporadic pilots and point solutions. Ninety percent of these pioneers report they have a strategy in place already. What’s even more interesting is that 72 percent of them expect AI applications to primarily deliver revenue increases in the next five years, as opposed to mere efficiency gains. This means that AI will no longer be limited to just optimizing operations but is driving entire new business models. Emulating these pioneers, it might be time for you, too, to “become real” about AI by moving beyond process optimization. Armed with growing AI acumen, ask yourself: how would you radically re-design your business model from scratch today? Andrew Ng, the Chairman and CEO of Landing AI and former head of the Google Brain team and the Baidu AI Group, provides some helpful guidance in his new AI Transformation Playbook. He suggests forming an internal AI team that spans different business functions. Further, he advises companies to diversify their AI investment by creating multiple AI assets while making sure they all present an industry-specific advantage rather than merely a broad operational capability. Finally, he reminds us of the “virtuous cycle of AI” when designing AI-driven activities: more data -> better product -> more users -> more data -> better product, and so on. Simply put: an effective AI strategy is always an effective data strategy. When will Blockchain finally deliver on its grand promise? Well, how about 2019?! The past two years saw a roller coaster ride for cryptocurrencies, starting with a breathtaking value increase of 3,252 percent in 2017 and a drop of 60 percent in crypto market value in 2018. Last December, the price of Bitcoin was $19,783, today it is $3,810 (the other two main cryptocurrencies, Ethereum, Litecoin, also dropped significantly). With its retail transactions declining rapidly, the most prominent of these currencies, Bitcoin, may now go into the annals of digital history as the Friendster (remember?) of crypto. But some say this crypto-winter may actually pave the way for different, more sophisticated blockchain applications. Shermin Voshmgir, co-founder of BlockchainHub, director of the Institute of Cryptoeconomics in Vienna, and author of an upcoming book on Blockchain, told me bullishly that this will be the year when Blockchain will grow up beyond Bitcoin and enable a whole new economy: the token economy. She believes that Bitcoin, despite its ultimate decline, has pioneered an operating system for “a new type of economy where is has become feasible for everyone to issue their own purpose-oriented token.” Indeed, tokens may create new marketplaces and new incentives to change or exhibit certain behaviors, such as planting trees instead of cutting them by mining “tree tokens” or saving CO2 emissions by biking instead of using the car through mining “Co2 tokens.” Some of these new tokens die on the vine (including, not surprisingly, Kodak’s). But still, as of today, 2,068 cryptocurrencies were listed on coinmarketcap. Countries such as Venezuela or cities such as Dubai or Lubljana have begun to create their own tokens as an exchange system to foster citizenship and virtual currency for tourists, and others including Berkeley, CA are expected to follow suit. Even soccer clubs such as Newcastle United are considering launching initial coin offerings. Blockchain is also serving as operating system for some transactions that are, although legalized in Canada and some US states, not performed by banks, which is why, for example, a formidable “alternate cannabis token economy” has emerged. Furthermore, applications such as BailBloc demonstrate how blockchain can be used for good by inviting users to donate their spare computer processing power to create a cryptocurrency named Monero. At the end of every month, the service exchanges Monero for US dollars and donates the earnings to one of the bail funds in the National Bail Fund Network. The transparency and mutual trust that blockchain provides are also perfectly suited for more effective supply chain management, blockchain expert Mark van Rijmenam argues, and he predicts in 2019 supply chains will be the first major enterprise use of blockchain. The revolutionary potential of blockchain is that it assigns and captures value for activities that have previously not been recognized as valuable or have lacked a transparent marketplace. Unlike the average consumer-investor, companies have not seized to pay attention. Consequently, blockchain will be one of the predominant themes at the upcoming World Economic Forum at the end of January, in the official program but even more so at the often more cutting-edge fringe events, from Davos BlockBase to Digital Davos. So where do you start? Ask yourself these questions: are there activities undertaken by colleagues or in your company’s ecosystem that constitute value that is not captured yet? If so, what kind of token can you launch that is linked to a real product, and how can you harness the token economics in your favor? Technology is not only increasingly social technology (using network effects), it is also a social activity. To adopt the new knowledge–the A and the B–and hone it in your organizations, community of practice is key. As Edward D. Hess and Kaz Gozdz contend, in the knowledge economy any successful organization will become a community–a “community of hyper-learners,” “a group of like-minded others of similar values and purpose.” Indeed, community motivates us to learn, creates a common striving (competition for respect among peers), and gives us a sense of belonging, a stable vantage point from which to observe and make sense of the fast-changing digital disruptions we’re all confronted with. No wonder new, alternative communal spaces are booming, from co-working to co-living to co-learning. Studies have shown that these spaces provide not only a sense of belonging, but also increase self-confidence. Combine these spaces with social learning and tech, and you have a winner. Labs, Meetups, and Basecamps are on the rise. Harvard Business School runs a Tech Club, and companies have begun to establish incubators embedded in vibrant urban communities (e.g. Daimler Trucks with its forthcoming Tech & Data Hub in the up-and-coming digital ecosystem of Lisbon) to pool knowledge and practitioners and lower the social barriers to skill acquisition. No longer can a single expert hold all the wisdom or connect all the dots alone. Peer exchange and critical community discourse are crucial for not only accessing but internalizing new knowledge and skills. Moreover, community rituals can help build the kind of muscle memory that initiates and sustains behavior change. In addition, communities are emerging that cater to the need to embrace new tech while also catering to our full selves through meditation, yoga, mindfulness, or other forms of conscious living. Take the co-living community The Assemblage in New York, that offers community, professional learning, and personal growth all at once. Or consider The Learning Hotel, one of Tablet Hotel Magazine’s visions for the “hotels of tomorrow,” a not-yet-realized concept that would tap into the collective wisdom of its guests by curating and gathering them in a meaningful way. When it comes to tech literacy, the intersection of hospitality, experience economy, and social learning is a space to watch. Community is not just the oldest human technology, it is also the enabler of essential human qualities: our ability to imagine alternate worlds through gatherings and stories. More than ever, every effort to strengthen innovation and drive transformation will need to foster these inherently social traits. This is why, as part of their AI strategy, companies should hone their workers’ artistic intelligence and offer art classes. For every pilot project in blockchain, they should treat their employees for a night out at cooking school. Without the C, the A and B are nothing. In 2019, even the most exponential technology won’t be going anywhere if it’s not coming home.

2019,Written by James Prashant Fonseka," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in James Prashant Fonseka Follow -- Listen Share I’m starting a new tradition — writing annual New Year’s Eve posts. These will complement my birthday posts and hopefully everything else I write. Sometimes my writings will be brief, and at other times lengthier. Birthday posts are more reflective and centered about my own personal development and evolution while these posts will be more forward looking and touch on subjects well beyond the subjective. There will be some overlap, though, and I’m quite okay with that. Last year’s New Year’s resolution was to have no resolution and live life with no particular goals or aims; to ‘do nothing.’ My intent was simply to take a break. I’d say I largely succeeded and an unplanned side effect was trading off productivity for awareness. I spent more time observing the world and those around me. I spent less time in my own head and more empathizing with others. I suspect dealing with unexpected death, loss, pain, and accidents that happen to have occurred this year was easier than it would have otherwise been in this frame of mind, though of course one can never really know. If I failed in trying to do nothing, it was in doing something. It turns out it’s really hard to do nothing. But let’s say for the sake of exposition that I sufficiently well approximated doing nothing, insofar as feasible. I ask that you grant me some latitude and that we just agree to call whatever I was doing ‘doing nothing.’ Something funny happens when you’re ‘doing nothing.’ It’s almost like what happens when you eat nothing. I’ve really taken to fasting because I enjoy the exercise of will power required to resist hunger. There may or may not be health benefits to this; I don’t know and frankly don’t care. I simply enjoy the feeling. The type of hunger that you experience after not eating for 48+ hours is very different from the hunger you feel when you skip a meal or are excessively stressed. After 48+ hours, you feel hunger not in your stomach but in your fingers and toes. Hunger falls from consciousness into your inner being. The primal sensation is exhilarating and your desire for food transforms from pragmatic to spiritual. I’ve noted a similar effect after dabbling in doing nothing. My desire to do is amplified by doing nothing. Actually, it goes further than that. I thank Professor Niklas Frykman, my senior thesis reader, for my most eye opening lesson in college. The single point that stands out in my memory was that freedom was defined by a lack of it, and that the concept of freedom only made sense in a society where some lacked it. This came up in a course on slavery. He illustrated this point by having us imagine living on an island where we had infinite food and resources with no work, an Edenic paradise of sorts, and pondering the concept of a vacation. Almost self-evidently, the word loses meaning in that world. A vacation only makes sense as the opposite of work and without work it has no meaning. Similarly, action can be best understood through inaction. Doing then may be defined as the opposite of not doing. By doing nothing, I’ve come to understand what it means to do something. I have been feeling a way that re-contextualizes all of my past experiences. Sometimes when I thought I was doing a lot, I was actually doing very little. And at the times when I thought I was doing nothing, I was actually doing quite a lot. This isn’t particularly insightful as it’s a somewhat obvious consequence of the subjectivity inherent to almost everything. What’s more interesting is the mechanism underlying that changing perspective. My simple theory is as follows: in going through the motions of day to day life, we tend to myopically define or perceive what we are doing as what we ought to be doing; in not doing, we are freed to define future action with less of the baggage and bias from past or present action. It’s easy to get caught up in the rat race or stuck in a hamster wheel; I’ll leave it to the reader to choose their preferred rodent metaphor. With time away from doing it becomes easier to see that there are other things that you could be doing and that before, you may not really have been doing much at all. This brings me to the state of world affairs today. By many indicators, these are the best of times, yet many feel like these are the worst of times. There are so many real causes for concern. If you’re a leftist you’re worried climate change will destroy the world. If you’re a rightist you’re worried the rise of illiberal powers will destroy the world. It seems a contradiction that we could be concurrently living in the best and worst of times. But what if we are Icarus flying too close to the sun? I worry that we may be; the systems that hold as together may soon tear us apart. It’s quite easy to argue that capitalism has done more to improve the lot of humanity than any system before, but it will soon fail. The reason for that is simple and was predicted by Marx long ago. Competition drives costs down; technology enables them to go to zero. As the marginal cost of goods and services approaches zero, the value of labor will also approach zero shifting the balance of labor and capital entirely to capital; a self-evidently precarious state for humanity. What will we do when great wealth exists but there are no jobs and wages to be had? As of the end of 2018 — we don’t have a clue. Some talk of universal basic income as a solution, but that would at best be a short-term fix. Socialist societies in which humans derive more of their sense of worth from noneconomic factors may be relatively better suited to weather the storm. But, that’s hardly any consolation given how powerless those nations will be in aggregate relative to the capitalist giants. The economic and military powerhouses of east and west will, in all likelihood, set the course for humanity. I suspect the solutions will have to be as radical and totalizing as the problem. It’s a perilous and exciting time for humanity which makes it an opportune time to be alive. In my own struggles and experiences, I see those of our human collective. As I redefine action in the face of inaction, I envision a future in which I alongside many others work to avoid some of these calamitous situations. That imagined future life seems more purposeful than the one led by many of us today. In 2018 I took a break of sorts and gained some clarity as to what really matters to me and what I ought to do; what sorts of actions I ought to take. There is much that is important to me, but little that I have the power to address today. It’s about time to go back to the drawing board, so that’s what I will do in 2019. Instead of drawing, however, I will write. That is my goal for the new year — to write and publish an essay ever week. Hopefully that habit will endure beyond this coming year, but one must start somewhere. P.S. Though we have yet to agree on the exact terms, my good friend Jon and I will devise a mutual accountability system to ensure that we follow through on our similar goals for the new year. P.P.S.

Grandes Mulheres da Ciência e Tecnologia – Florence Rena Sabin,Written by Ana Paula Lourenço," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Ana Paula Lourenço Follow -- Share “Qual a parte do corpo humano que você mais gosta?”, alguém já te fez esta pergunta? Bem, para Florence Rena Sabin ela devia ser constante. Vamos entender o por quê. Ela nasceu em 9 de novembro de 1871, em Central City, Colorado, Estados Unidos da América. Em 1893 graduou-se no Smith College, em Northampton e, após ensinar matemática por dois anos em Denver e zoologia no Smith College por um ano, ela foi a primeira mulher a ser aceita na Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, no ano de 1896, onde construiu uma grande reputação por conta das suas pesquisas em embriologia e histologia. Florence se tornou uma anatomista, por isso acredito que a pergunta do início do texto lhe era muito recorrente. Um outro grande feito de Florence Rena é que ela foi a primeira mulher eleita para a National Academy of Sciences e uma das primeiras mulheres médicas norte-americanas a construir carreira como pesquisadora. Em 1900, recebeu o título de Doutora pela Johns Hopkins e em 1901 publicou “An Atlas of the Medulla and Midbrain”, um livro de texto sobre medicina que se tornou muito popular na época. No ano seguinte, a Johns Hopkins finalmente revogou sua política de não contratar mulheres e ela passou então a integrar o staff de pesquisadores. Destacou-se como pesquisadora do sistema linfático, onde reformulou a explicação tradicional do desenvolvimento do mesmo, provando que o desenvolvimento das veias no embrião ocorre fora em tecidos. Foi ainda professora de histologia na Johns Hopkins University entre 1917 e 1925, e membro do Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research entre 1925 e 1938, onde se aposentou e tornou-se emérita. Voltou a morar em Denver, Colorado, onde trabalhou para o governo do estado. Ufa! Quanta coisa a Dra. Sabin fez e contribuiu para a ciência. Suas pesquisas ajudam até hoje no entendimento embrionário. Entre seus destaques estão: Ela faleceu em 3 de outubro de 1953, mas o seu legado permanece até os dias atuais. -- -- Consultora de pré-vendas e negócios | Founder Byte Girl | Palestrante LinkedIn: /in/anapaulalourenco Instagram: @ana_paulalouren Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*Io4aqHAcggxxelOu9PDp8A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*xDtiOxF0wMtPXz06QrHpLg@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*Io4aqHAcggxxelOu9PDp8A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*_mtktsDJvzQ7b42-9Wm67w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Io4aqHAcggxxelOu9PDp8A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*oRhJlZtFPanpWmk9Q4jaAw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Io4aqHAcggxxelOu9PDp8A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*cl6VuBjrBDS0tGQCZ_ZKgQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Io4aqHAcggxxelOu9PDp8A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*R4sk_wd_tTnhR4bkX6Q9ag.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Io4aqHAcggxxelOu9PDp8A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*vzu3JPzaq2EZKTZNY9BhLA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*lEmL62oZdrOOWIzAAFKiFg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*i2zLIwC9mftamP1dbciCeQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*cBIFfjjqzx8pzaemnAM0rQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*EhiV5eo34TIkvI6u-JFYmg.jpeg']",1-Jan-19,https://medium.com/?source=post_page-----e657b197f1bb--------------------------------,1,2 min read
Happy New Year 2019 !!!,"Written by Maddy,Top 5 technologies to watch,Books In Shelf,Top 5 Programming language to learn"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Maddy Follow -- Listen Share Another trip around the sun, New year is like the birthday celebration of the earth. Everyone on earth is happy, motivated, enthusiast about something refreshing and so much positive vibe all around. Quarter of contacts are live on Instagram and others are also busy in writing digital history for their kids. Our WhatsApp message box is full of happy new year wishes and our mind is full of opportunity to look forward. Once Albert Einstein said : LEARN from yesterday, LIVE for today, HOPE for tomorrow Lets see what I have in my list to look in 2019. Technology, Programming languages, Books, Traveling, Sports and many more thing. Here I am going to share some of hot stuff to watch. AI gradually impacting in our life, The way we live, work, play and communicating to smart devices. AI is everywhere in modern lifestyle. We all are using some sort of AI which may include App assistance, chat bot, navigation services or smart Apps. The speed which we are going I won’t wonder if the 2024 presidential election in the USA will Siri vs Alexa or Cortona vs OK Google. The whole purpose of AI is to create intelligent machines. A machine which has problem solving power and can perform difficult and tedious task by own. A machine which can learn from the input provided and give some accurate outcome. AI can learn and perform by the given set of input, which turn into the model to the next result. AI is an essential toolfor problem solving. Machine learning and Robotics are also very important part of AI. 2. Machine Learning :- Machine learning is sub branch of AI where machine learn by discovering pattern insights from data. Machine learning is programmed in such a way to handle the request by using analysis, self-training, observation and experience. Data play a big role in this concept. Well in 20th century Machines run on oil then in century machine will run on data. We have achieved remarkable amount of success in this technology and it is growing bigger and bigger. I will come out how machine learning works with algorithm and its example later this year. For Machine learning example you can see my blog. This is must watch and learn technology in 2019. 3. Blockchain :- Blockchain in 2019 is more beyond than cryptocurrency and bitcoin. Simplest way to define blockchain is you can add data to chain, not take away from the chain. We are here making chain of data. Blockchain providing security with may other ways. The blockchain also provide transparency for transactions in every crypto transaction.Blockchain can change complete global supply chain cycle. Major of the big technology giant and financials firms are adopting to this technology on a big scale. Finance, Retail, Healthcare are having major potential fields to adopt this technology. 4. Internet of Things:- In simple term Internet of Things(IOT) define as Internet enabling in smart devices to send and receive the data. IOT involves extended internet connectivity beyond the regular devices like desktops, laptops and mobile. It involve great range of device which is used in smart home appliances, commercial application, automation, transportation, manufacturing Industry, Agriculture and many more. Huge amount of IOT application are developed to support these devices. IOT is definitely will be the next big thing of coming decade. In this year IOT will keep that pace with some addition in new domain. 5. Virtual Reality: Virtual Reality is an interactive computer-generated experience taking place within a simulated environment. In Past years we saw its transition from a curiosity into a tangible tool. In 2019 this will be hot topic along with mixed and argument reality. Things I am going to keep eye on in 2019 Next Boss of Manchester United to Speed of Lewis Hamilton. My next internet creation (Kinda excited about that) to Dallas cowboys. Many challenges are ahead to tackle but ya We Can Do It. (Soon I am go to publish story on Man Utd mess and gadgets to watch in 2019. Stay Tune) Welcome to 2019 ! My message for 2019 to you is Stay Awesome Stay Blessed. Keep creating cool stuff.

When Technology and Humanity Collide,Written by Shawn Hamman," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Shawn Hamman Follow -- 1 Listen Share I’ve found that some of the most interesting ideas are formed around the messy, rapidly developing blending of technology and humanity. One such techno/human fusion is Twitter, a place where somewhat slow-changing society and culture comes up hard against fast changing technology, creating inevitable emotional turbulence and much uncertainty, while furiously generating and spreading new ideas and new concepts. That’s the one real utility that Twitter has for me; it’s why I follow the diverse set of people I do in an attempt to avoid an echo chamber and be open to diverse and contrasting views, as annoying as this sometimes is. I came across a tweet recently that tied together some fascinating threads of messy techno/human confluences for me — concepts where human nature, technology and ethics are colliding in an interesting and unexpected way: luck, self-driving cars and Chinese social credit scores. It suggestively questioned how awful it would be if self-driving cars in China were to use the reportedly planned Chinese “social credit system” to make the choice between who lives and who dies in accident situations. Presumably those with a “better” score get spared over those with a worse score, with the immediate proposition being that that would be awful. Perhaps it would be and, if I were a betting man, I’d put money on most people thinking that it would be at least some flavour of unpleasant. I wondered, would it actually be awful? And if so, why would it be awful? Self-Driving Cars A particularly tricky problem to solve in a self-driving car system is, for all intents and purposes, dealing with the real world manifestation of the classic ethical Trolley Problem thought experiment. Given an anticipated accident scenario where death or injury to somebody is unavoidable, how should a self driving car’s software ethically decide who the victim should be out of a set of options? For example, the software of a car might detect that an accident is inevitable and it has detected two categories of object in front of it and the only option available to it is avoiding one category of object over the other. Should it — the software — choose to drive into one child instead of a group of adults? Should it pick a couple of old people to die over a single young person? Should the car always save the driver over any other people? This is not a trivial problem to overcome and no doubt there will be extreme disagreement on how it eventually gets solved. It’s become a very real challenge for the legion of programmers working on what will likely be one of the most profound changes to society to date (and, in my opinion, the most interesting software challenges in the world to be working on right now). Is it even possible to have an acceptable way of rank ordering the value of people when it comes to making life and death decisions? The Implications of Automation and Decision Delegation Most people don’t need to think through ethical conundrums like the Trolley Problem and throughout history this kind of thing has generally been left to philosophers and clergy to contemplate. We, as a species, are now rapidly moving past the information age and into the age of automation; the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the confluence of technologies blurring the lines between the physical and the digital. Breakthroughs in a number of fields are driving this revolution forward — robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, hyper-connectedness through high bandwidth, the (industrial) internet of things. What perhaps isn’t so obvious is that using artificial intelligence, machine learning and automation technologies (especially complex automation technology like self-driving cars) is effectively delegating and outsourcing the (increasingly more often) serious and complex (and ethical) decision making to machines. By its nature, solving a problem with software typically requires programmers to formally codify in excruciating detail the decision making or solutioning process. For complex decisions this is extremely challenging and sometimes impossible. This difficulty, along with improvements in computer hardware and access to large amounts of data has driven the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence forward. One of the issues with artificial intelligence, neural networks and machine learning in general is that it’s difficult (if not impossible) to explain exactly how a decision is made or a result obtained because of the nature of how problems are solved by the technology and the nature of the problem space to which it is applied. This is a real impediment when trying to determine accountability, particularly in high-consequence scenarios. Ironically this means that delegated decision making in something like the automation of driving inherently requires us — programmers, people — to either address and formally answer complex ethical challenges like the Trolley Problem for all possible scenarios by hand or employ nearly-opaque, nearly-black-box technology that makes it difficult or impossible to explain how a decision was made. Addressing the Trolley Problem inherently means having to, at some point, rank people (or categories of people) in order of preference: who to kill and who not to kill. Will it be important to us as a society and as individuals to know exactly how and why a machine decided that one person lived while another died? Would it be better if a decision was made taking into account as much data about the individuals as possible? Or will simpler, impersonal categorical choice be acceptable, perhaps even be preferred? Social Credit Widely reported this year (Business Insider; Bloomberg), the Chinese central government, ever practical and efficient authoritarians, are said to be leveraging Big Data technology and ubiquitous surveillance to implement an explicit “social credit scoring” system, effectively standardising the assessment of each citizen’s business, economic and social reputation. If one thinks about it, in the West (whether intentionally or not), various social media combined with credit scores already can (and do, effectively) function as an implicit social credit score. Whether planned or haphazard, both implicit and explicit scoring mechanisms seem to have similar and largely punitive outcomes: say or do the wrong things where your score is measured and you could lose your job or access to opportunities. Generate a bad credit score and access to financial or social services could become more challenging. Interestingly, the very idea of a planned social scoring system seems to be universally reviled in the West. Most people I’ve come across with an opinion on the topic — like the tweet that started this off — flinch at the thought of what the Chinese government might be up to. It seems extremely dark and dystopian with what we imagine to be some terrible consequences. The very concept seems to bring up a natural revulsion and I’ve seen it described in many negative terms: “awful”, “terrible”, “shuddering at the thought”, “worrying”. The US Vice President Mike Pence described it as “an Orwellian system premised on controlling virtually every facet of human life.” The push-back against the pervasive, already implemented Western platforms of Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube doesn’t seem to be quite so vociferous, however. I can’t help but wonder if it’s the more explicative central planning approach that resonates too much with Communism, or a just bit of a cultural blindspot at work there, where much is forgiven or overlooked in the name of capitalism and profit. On Trust I think there are two primary reasons for people (in the West at least) to be deeply skeptical of the planned, explicit Chinese social credit scoring system. The first and obvious one lies in the judicious granting of trust to those who would define, operate and apply such a scoring system. Can the people who are trying to implement this system be trusted to implement it fairly, securely, impartially and keep it from being abused? Can the system, even if implemented initially to meet the aforementioned conditions, be guaranteed to stay that way over time? I think the easy answer is no, it’s not likely or at the very least extremely difficult to get right. The consequences for getting it wrong seem like they could be pretty dire. An interesting counterfactual to contemplate is if, for the sake of argument, a social credit scoring system could be implemented and operated by a completely trustworthy, fair and impartial, benevolent super AGI, able to take into account all aspects of a person to generate the score, would there still be an objection to the concept? Is there utility in having a “social credit score”, implementation and operation aside? The second reason for Western skepticism of the concept of a social credit score is that it seems to boil down to another class system, albeit a significantly more complex and granular one. The way society seems to be trying to reduce competition in schools and the prevailing social justice opinions that seem to be insisting on equality and equity in all things doesn’t align very well with the concept: instead of having two or three classes (which already exist), the social credit score can effectively be an infinite number of individual classes and the presentation of this is much starker. The very concept tries to quantify the worth of one individual over the other which isn’t a particularly palatable approach, particularly in the West. That, in itself, is worth considering: why is quantifying the worth of individuals and ranking them so off-putting? On Luck A third and perhaps less obvious reason is that what a “social credit score” is measuring is in fact not value or reputation exactly, but rather an aggregate of a subset of an individual’s luck across an arbitrarily chosen number of measurable dimensions. Most if not all things about a person comes down to luck. It is the extremely unpalatable but entirely factual way of the universe. The genes you’re born with, the family you’re born into, the city, state, country you happen to be born in, the environment you grow up in, the air you breathe, the food you eat, the people who surround you, the culture you exist in: none of it is your doing. You made none of the choices for your circumstance or any of the things that you physically are. The choices you think you’ve made were made with the mental machinery that you had no influence in creating, that was entirely determined by what came before you, by the genes you were conceived with and where you happen to have come into being. By chance. Luck: good, bad or ugly. Everything about you and me and everybody else is a measure of luck along some dimension. The difficulty with a social credit score then is that it is an imperfect measure of how lucky or unlucky a person is. The trouble is that nearly all societies take a punitive approach to non-conforming and non-performing individuals. Once you realise that a person’s disposition is effectively due to luck and their actions too are due to luck — good or bad — punishing bad luck and rewarding good luck seems somewhat cruel. Quantifying how lucky a person is to inform decision making about an individual in the context of society — even if that quantification is useful or valuable in predicting future behaviour and a net benefit to society as a whole — without a commensurate change in the society from a punitive to a supportive and restorative approach with regard to misbehaviour seems intuitively unfair. Conclusion Even if cultural differences (between East and West perhaps) cause the concept of a social credit score to be looked at differently, the tsunami wave of big data technology, fanatical metrics collection, pervasive social media and the hyper-connectedness of everything has meant that people are being quantified and scored whether they know it, like it or not. It is happening. For the moment, purportedly explicitly in the East, and definitely implicitly in the West. Whether this scoring will turn out to be a net benefit to society or not remains to be seen. That same technology wave is also forcing forward progress in automation which will inevitably mean machines making serious ethical decisions on our behalf and it is not clear if we will prefer those ethical decisions to be made with hyper-personal data — something like social credit scores — or if we’d be more comfortable with semi-anonymous, categorical decisions. The near future will surely be some of the most interesting years in human experience. -- -- 1 Part time hacker, occasional runner, full time technical organisation leader; Python aficionado, Objective C enthusiast, Swift admirer, technology connoisseur.

Biochipping & Blockchain — Dystopian or Decentralized Future?,Written by Patrick Tan," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Patrick Tan Follow Predict -- Share Of all the table games at casinos, I’ve always had a preference for blackjack — in particular because if you play disciplined basic strategy and count cards and the casino doesn’t use a card shuffling machine but deals from a 6-deck shoe (plus another bunch of rules which I won’t go into detail with), you can get the odds to within 48.5% in favor of the player — meaning the house has its odds whittled down to 1.5% over a disciplined player. Mind you, I use the term “disciplined,” not “skilled.” That’s because anybody can be a decent blackjack player with discipline and hard work — which is why so few people do it — beyond a point, it becomes a job. Unfortunately, this particular evening I wasn’t playing in Vegas, or even Reno for that matter, but instead at the glitzy (not) “Integrated Resort” (but really it’s a casino) in Singapore — Marina Bay Sands. At the behest of some guests, I was playing a decent game at the blackjack table, enjoying some casual banter with my guests and some steely eyed ladies of leisure, when my phone buzzed indicating that a small transaction had been placed on my credit card to purchase train tickets at London’s Paddington Station. “Interesting,” I thought, “How did I buy those tickets from almost 7,000 miles away?” In an instant, I knew that my credit card had been compromised, but I wasn’t about to call the credit card company yet as… -- -- Predict General Counsel for ChainArgos, the blockchain intelligence firm made famous for breaking the story that BUSD was unbacked by US$1.4bn Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*CHmajIxeqU0MhGYZ4ViZAA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*EetZyjDw-19wRRBzc6fSMA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*fN8s5aU6qlwhz3obs7NqvQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*CHmajIxeqU0MhGYZ4ViZAA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*EetZyjDw-19wRRBzc6fSMA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*U6vk8ueVdU9BNzzynNaShA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*CHmajIxeqU0MhGYZ4ViZAA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*QYU1lHOnL05frrxuEKIgLg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*V0qWMQ8V5_NaF9yUoHAdyg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*-lDTOpuIP0FSwEqDAyvaYg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*TBVjIx-nVOpQdDVpl5Um1w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*sT2qfXTZTK1s95GwLEJrDQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*CHmajIxeqU0MhGYZ4ViZAA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*niQ0sAwUszuyNMyH.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*pZPMtIONqtJYi2xHYD_Ivg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*OOenjvxqWE1STWWu7JCVLw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*T9N3Et8jNZzkvSptC0W-pQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*-OB6qvYrcRPzK0Wo', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*psWVDpjOQ80Lfn6J0J2nmg.gif', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*9U9tJpX9FwXXxMGY.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*p6kCCpNZARkVEYv4OCH7GQ@2x.jpeg']",1-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@patricktankt?source=post_page-----799f5b0d20cb--------------------------------,54,9 min read

The Spark,"Sign up for the Quarterly (at most) readers’ digest here.,Written by Shahir Mishriki,About Me,My Interests,My Aspirations,My Day Job,How I do it?,What Do I Get From The Spark?,Tune in to find out who the monster in Bird Box Is.,FROM KETO TO CHEATO…,AI: Are we incentivizing uniformity or celebrating diversity?"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Shahir Mishriki Follow -- Listen Share Hello, and welcome to The Spark. After a couple of conversations, I’ve made the decision to re-boot my blog. As an introduction, I will tell you a little about myself, my interests and what you can expect from The Spark. My name is Shahir Mishriki, and I am a working professional based out of Calgary, Alberta. I studied chemical engineering before pursuing a career in business consulting. Prior to moving to Calgary, I lived in Edmonton for four years after immigrating to Canada from Cairo, Egypt when I was 14 years old. I have been fascinated by the make of a strong leader, which I will unpack throughout The Spark. Outside of work, my passions include food, politics, law and technology. I am curious about the ‘inverse’ of patterns and how they can change our perspectives. My dream career is one that combines Business, Technology & Law (or Policy). If I had any job in the world, I would want to be a chief editor for the Economist (maybe the data-driven sections). After graduation, I opted for a career in consulting. As a manager, my full-time job is to lead a team of problem solvers assigned to tackle a business challenge, mostly for Global 2000 Resources [Energy, Mining, Chemicals and Utilities] Companies.

You Probably Don’t Want A Thicker iPhone,"Even if it has better battery life, a thicker phone isn’t always advantageous.,The Apple product experience,The iPhone XR Problem,Conclusion,Written by Isaac Young"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Isaac Young Follow Techstream -- Listen Share If you’ve ever bought or seen any Apple products, you’ll know that first and foremost, they are a design company. From the trendy iBook to today’s MacBook, Apple’s devices look stunning. However, if you’ve owned an iPhone, you’ll know that battery life is one of the iPhone’s most limiting factors. My personal iPhone 6s lasts barely 4 hours with my usage. Like many online, I’ve always wondered: “Why doesn’t Apple make a thicker phone with better battery life?” It sounds perfect on paper: a phone with great thermals, unending battery life, and performance to boot — and all you have to trade is a little heft. But are you really willing to take that deal? When Apple debuted the ultra-thin MacBook in 2015, it was a controversial device. The knee-jerk reaction of the community was to incessantly question it. Was one port too few? Was the keyboard too thin for its own good? Would people pay the premium for it? The answer to all those questions turned out to be yes, but in person, the main reaction was to look at it. “Look at it! It’s so thin, it tapers off to almost nothing!” If you thought that was a one-off, take a look at what people were saying about the new 5.9mm thick iPad Pros. “Yes it bends, but have you seen how thin it is?” Apple knows all too well the reaction of its customers when they see their products — first impressions count. People that fall in love with a product at first sight will most likely buy it, so Apple wants to create a positive first impression. Apple has also built a reputation on sleek and slim devices. Since the MacBook Air, introduced in 2008, Apple has been squeezing devices as slim as possible, and people like it. The MacBook Air released to much fanfare, and sold in droves even though it was monstrously overpriced, with a $1,399 64GB SSD. This has been Apple’s modus operandi for so long that people have come to expect it, and are shocked when anything is released that doesn’t look as elegant as they expect. While often glossed over in day to day debates, “handfeel” is one of the most important things for a product that is placed predominantly in the hand. A thicker phone, even by a little bit, is noticeable when you use your phone day in day out. Of course, with their expansive R&D department, Apple knows this, so phones are made as ergonomically as possible, with thickness kept in check. Apple is so focused on ergonomics, that when originally releasing the iPhone 5 with the taller display, they set out developer guidelines for ‘safe zones’ where a right-handed user could and couldn’t touch without stretching. This kind of thoughtfulness is thrown out the window if your phone weighs 400 grammes and has the portability of a brick. Since the iPhone 6s, Apple has reversed their stance and started thickening their iPhones, bit by bit. The response was mostly positive up to the iPhone X, which was the thickest iPhone since the iPhone 4s. However, things changed when Apple released the iPhone XR at 8.3mm, a full 0.6mm thicker than the iPhone X. The iPhone XR was meant to be everything that people had been asking for, for almost a decade. It was cheaper than the flagship phone. It had the same performance. It had better battery life, and as a result, it was a little thicker. Aiming to please everyone, it debuted with a multitude of different colors, including the sought after Product (Red). What was not to like? But the community went bonkers over it. “It’s too thick!”, they cried. “Look on the bezels on that!” “Why is the screen so low resolution?”. These three quotes show Apple’s true market. Apple fans, no matter what they say, don’t want a thick phone with great battery life. Never before have Henry Fords words rung more true: “If I’d asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, ‘A faster horse!” — Henry Ford The iPhone XR is a great phone. It’s everything people have been asking for, and some extra. Yes, the screen is lower resolution than the iPhone X, but if you’re looking close enough to notice the pixels, then you should check your viewing distances. The resolution doesn’t need to improve past what Apple dubs “Retina” — There aren’t any VR headsets for iPhone, so your eyes shouldn’t be that close to the screen anyway. And yet, people refuse to buy the iPhone XR. It isn’t selling nearly as well as Apple had hoped, and the fanfare is minimal. The iPhone XR simply doesn’t have the sex appeal that past iPhones have had. This is the problem with the proposal that people have brought up for years — it simply isn’t viable for a company like Apple to produce a phonezilla with unending battery life. If you’re in the market for an iPhone right now, I would highly recommend the iPhone XR. It’s not good looking by any means, but it has almost all the features of the iPhone XS at a fraction of the price. It has better battery life than both flagships, and will likely have better performance, thanks to it’s lower resolution screen. However, if you’re like most, your gut will tell you the iPhone XR isn’t right for you, because it probably isn’t. It doesn’t feel the same in the hand, and it doesn’t have the flagship feeling of the XS and XS Max. It isn’t the quintessential iPhone experience you’ve come to know and love. While the voice of reason is telling you to buy the XR, it won’t be the one living with it for 3–5 years. You will. -- -- Techstream Technology enthusiast, Freelance Writer, and Mobile Developer at PaperKite.

Messaging Queue? Makanan apa itu?,"Apa ya MQ ini?,Sebentar, kok dari tadi gua ga paham maksud Queue dalam MQ?,Pusing bos, ada contoh kasusnya gak?,Keuntungan lainnya bosque?,Hmmm, Kayanya pernah tau konsep ini di jaman kuliah dulu, ini Observer pattern gak sih?,Akhirnyaa….,What is message queuing? - CloudAMQP,What is a Message Queue?,Observer vs Pub-Sub pattern,Written by danish jatmiko"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in danish jatmiko Follow -- Share Happy New Year 2019 for everyone who celebrate! Selamat datang di post pertama saya di medium. Salah satu hal yang ingin saya mulai kerjakan di tahun ini adalah untuk mulai menulis dan sharing beberapa hal yang saya ketahui melalui pengalaman dan hasil pembelajaran saya selama ini dengan sesederhana mungkin. Untuk post pertama ini saya menggunakan Bahasa Indonesia agar lebih memudahkan saja, pastinya juga karena saya sadar bahasa Inggris saya buruk XD. Mengenai topicnya sendiri, mengapa MQ(Messaging Queue)? Saya memilih topic ini karena ini adalah salah satu konsep yang paling challenging untuk saya pahami saat join Tokopedia pertama kalinya, dan sangat menarik untuk dipelajari terutama untuk teman-teman yang baru masuk ke dunia web engineering. Sederhananya MQ adalah suatu bentuk komunikasi antar service secara asynchronous. Dimana konsep ini banyak digunakan dalam dunia web yang menggunakan microservice architecture. Biasanya konsep ini digunakan untuk memisahkan banyak proses yang berat, batch processing, dan untuk segala sesuatu yang tidak harus diselesaikan secara synchronous. Ada 3 komponen utama dalam sebuah konsep MQ. Yaitu Producer, Queue Platform, dan Consumer. Sama seperti artinya, Queue berarti antrian dalam Bahasa Indonesia. Queue Platform sangat berperan dalam mewujudkan antrian data dari Producer ke Consumer. Data yang diberikan oleh produser tidak akan didistribusikan langsung ke consumernya, melainkan akan dibuatkan sebuah antrian dimana consumer akan memproses data satu per satu sesuai dengan antrian yang ada. Contohnya, suatu saat Producer melakukan publish 1000 data dalam 1 detik, namun consumer yang ada hanya mampu memproses 10 data per 1 detik. Maka akan dibuatkan sebuah antrian dari 1000 data tersebut menggunakan konsep FIFO (First In First Out). Dalam kasus ini semua data akan terselesaikan dalam waktu 100 detik. Dari contoh tersebut bisa dilihat penerapan MQ untuk batch processing. Lalu untuk sedekar informasi juga, kita bisa menggunakan 2 atau lebih consumer untuk memproses data yang sama. Dalam kasus di atas kita menganggap bahwa hanya ada 1 consumer, bagaimana bila kita memiliki 5 consumer untuk memproses sebuah antrian (1000 data)? dengan kecepatan 1 consumer = 10 data/detik, maka bila ada 5 consumer = 50 data/detik. 1000 data akan bisa diselesaikan dalam waktu 20 detik saja. Untuk lebih memudahkan untuk memahami konsep MQ, saya akan berikan sedikit contoh sederhana dalam penerapan MQ. Bayangkan saja anda adalah engineer akan mendevelop sebuah marketplace online, dimana ada salah satu order yang akan di konfirmasi oleh pembeli bahwa barang telah sampai. Kira-kira proses yang akan terjadi setelah pembeli konfirmasi adalah: Mungkin pada saat pertama kali marketplace online anda release, semua poin di atas tidak masalah bila dijalankan secara synchronous. Namun bagaimana bila semakin banyak business model yang diinginkan? Misal ingin menambah pengecekan fraud, atau notifikasi berupa Whatsapp, bahkan memberikan bonus dan promo tambahan ke pembeli? Kita perlu memikirkan kembali arsitektur kita. Dalam kasus di atas, kita bisa menggunakan konsep MQ. Producer dalam kasus ini adalah service yang bagian mengupdate status transaksi saja, lalu setelah itu publish data ke Queue Platform, dimana data ini akan didistribusikan ke services consumer bagian update status toko, barang, tambah reputasi, kirim notifikasi, promo, dll. Setiap consumer akan memproses data yang diterima masing-masing tanpa mengganggu consumer lainnya. Update status transaksi menjadi selesai merupakan proses synchronous yang tak dapat dihindari, namun untuk mengirim email, notifikasi, update status toko, tambah reputasi, berikan uang kepada penjual merupakan proses yang tidak harus saat itu juga berhasil, atau dalam artian lain masih bisa dimaklumi bila terjadi sedikit delay. Dengan hanya proses Update status transaksi yang menjadi proses utama dan synchronous, maka process time web service anda akan relatif lebih cepat daripada harus menjalankan lebih dari 10 business model sekaligus. Selain itu ini juga baik secara UX karena user tidak perlu menunggu lama. Menurut saya pribadi, fungsi utama dari MQ adalah kemampuan untuk berkomunikasi antar service tanpa harus berhubungan dengan langsung melalui API atau HTTP Protocol lainnya. Jadi antar service itu bisa tak saling mengenal, tapi masih mungkin berkomunikasi. Atau dalam bahasa Inggris dikenal dengan istilah Decouple. Dalam dunia microservices, ketergantungan antar service harus ditekan seminimal mungkin, tujuannya agar apabila suatu service down, maka service yang lainnya tidak perlu ikut down juga. Contohnya dalam kasus contoh konfirmasi buyer di atas, apabila saat ingin konfirmasi, tetapi service reputasi dan email down, apakah harus fitur konfirmasi ini ikutan gagal juga? dengan adanya MQ ini, apabila service email ataupun reputasi down, data untuk kedua service ini tidak hilang, tersimpan dalam queue dan dapat diproses kembali ketika kedua service tersebut Up. Dan secara UX baik karena buyer tetap berhasil konfirmasi. Pada awalnya saat saya belajar MQ, saya kira ini adalah observer pattern. Tapi setelah membaca artikel ini, saya jadi sadar bahwa konsep MQ ini berbeda sekali dengan Observer pattern, konsep MQ ini biasa dikenal dengan pub-sub pattern. Secara sederhana perbedaan utamanya adalah, kalau di pub-sub pattern, antara publisher dan subscriber itu tidak saling mengenal dan tidak terhubung secara langsung. Ada pihak ketiga yang berperan sebagai mediator untuk publisher dan subscriber saling berkomunikasi. Namun di Observer pattern, antara Object dan Observernya sudah saling mengenal terlebih dahulu dan mereka saling berkomunikasi secara langsung ketika ada suatu event. Untuk lebih jelasnya teman-teman bisa membaca artikel di link ini. Terima kasih teman-teman sudah meluangkan waktu untuk membaca artikel pertama saya ini. Saya tahu masih banyak kekurangan dalam artikel ini, oleh karena itu saya juga terbuka untuk saran dan kritik untuk kebaikan kita bersama. Bila ada konsep atau penjelasan saya yang kurang tepat, saya juga mohon maaf dan kita bisa diskusikan lagi di kolom komentar dibawah ya.

北歐創業論壇SLUSH工作人員申請介紹 下篇,"北歐創業論壇SLUSH工作人員申請介紹 上篇,Written by Wes Hsu,[會場的演講、推廣與招募],[會期的食衣住行],[芬蘭獨立日],[國際志工周的參訪],[志工限定會後派對],[小結]"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Wes Hsu Follow Wes Conference Review -- Share 前面介紹完志工申請的步驟，下篇將接續我在會場中遇到的參展攤位，以及當地的一周行程安排，其中還包含芬蘭獨立日與新創團隊工作環境的參訪。最後還有工作人員專屬的派對分享，如果還沒瀏覽上篇的讀者可以點擊下方連結。北歐創業論壇SLUSH工作人員申請介紹上篇。 medium.com 今年主場館有三大舞台，創辦人舞台(Founder Stage)，粉紅舞台(Pink Stage)，恆綠舞台(Evergreen Stage)，每個場地的演講節目表都十分緊湊，每場長度約二十分鐘，加入主持人的串場一天可以安排將近二十場講座，講者涵蓋了潛力獨角獸企業的創辦人、科技評論網站編輯、風險投資公司顧問、歐盟委員會官員、赫爾辛基市長、資訊科技教育家與加密貨幣發行人等，議題的設定也包括了農業科技、大數據分析、機器學習、擴增實境、區塊鍊、加密貨幣、資訊安全、教育創新、電子支付、物聯網、時尚流行產業與運輸物流業等，我一天基本上只聽兩三場，留下深刻印象的兩場，分別是無人機顛覆運輸產業(Launch: Transforming Delivery)，主講人是無人機貨物運輸服務公司Wing的執行長James Ryan Burgess；以及輿論戰場與媒體現況(Info war and peace: The current state of media)，採用訪談形式，主持人是富比世雜誌(Forbes)的歐洲編輯Alex Wood，接受訪問的是科技新聞網站TechCrunch的前共同總編輯Alexia Bonatsos。前者是從Google X專案中畢業的新創企業，在會議中也宣布明年春季開始在芬蘭試營運的計畫，並驕傲地表示會議前一周在寒冷環境下的成功試飛，給了工程團隊很大的信心，在歐洲後續的服務國家也能克服溫度所造成的續航力限制。然而二十分鐘過去，編號7000的原型機，還是只靜靜置於講桌，沒有實際起飛與展示包裹以繩索垂降的遞送方式，只用一分鐘的形象影片作說明，是讓在場眾多航空迷一個小小失望的原因。後者是討論媒體識讀(Media literacy)以及如何提升報導品質的論壇，由於紙媒與網路媒體對於閱聽人的生活影響力比例逐年改變，未經查證的資訊或是帶有偏見的評論變得更容易散播，而對民主與社會造成的傷害也是不分國界的，我想台灣能從國際間借鏡打擊假新聞的策略，來讓四年後的公投能反映出更加成熟的民主素養。 對於琳瑯滿目的講座選擇，大家不需要給自己太大的壓力把自由時段排入過多的節目，因為我並不建議將會場的時間都坐在座位上聽演講，一來是所以的演講影片都會在幾周內上傳影音平台YouTube的SLUSH官方頻道，二來是這些大型的演講大多不提供問答時間，除了少部分主持人接受觀眾互動軟體Slido的幾個問題，如果真的對於幾場演講有高度興趣，可以查看工作室訪談(Studio)節目表，兩個大舞台有想對應的如創辦人工作室(Founder Studio)與粉紅工作室(Pink Studio)，另一個同樣精彩的是展場工作室(Showcase Studio)。如果講者有前往工作室接受提問的行程，建議安排好換場步行時間，因為工作室的場地都是只能容納幾十人的小空間，比起上百人湧入的大舞台，需要更多捷足先登的策略。 除了這些固定節目外，場地其他部分如同我們在南港展覽館看到的攤位，只是換成深色的背景，搭配無所不在的霓虹燈配色燈光與雷射，再加上很多佈景主題甚至搭建起二樓的商務洽談專屬空間，讓投資者與創業者擁有更多的隱私。現場很多新創公司或是巨型跨國公司都展示虛擬實境(Virtual Reality)的服務，我在兩天親身體驗了三種不同的應用，第一個是名為Glue的芬蘭新創，可以連接地球兩端的團隊成員，在虛擬的會議室開會聽簡報，產品建模也能依照比例呈現，並且自由的在空間中翻轉；第二個是以柏林為基地的新創公司Athena，致力於原型車體內部設計，如座椅的擺設，而車窗以外的景色也隨著時間從郊區駛入市中心的高樓大廈環境，視覺化完整的乘車體驗。 最後一個是來自瑞典的機器人與自動化跨國企業ABB(Asea Brown Boveri)，直接引入電動方程式(Formula E)的競速遊戲，坐上可調式的低底盤賽車駕駛座，戴上虛擬實境眼鏡後手握方向盤開始比賽，由於過彎時的方向盤轉向反饋很強烈，視角畫面的流暢度很極高，我非常推薦大家在其他展覽也能親自體驗他們的遊戲。此外會場還有很多我這次來不及嘗試的服務應用，如芬蘭航空(Finnair)讓使用者潛入機場停機坪或是維修棚，模擬操作連結空橋的任務以及更換起降輪零件的工作，與醫療器材製造商廠嬌生公司(Johnson & Johnson)也導入醫院的手術模擬訓練，讓訪客可以依造指示進行膝關節手術。 當然，除了虛擬實境體驗外，單純跟參展者討論他們從事的科技領域也能帶來新鮮感。我在一個展示多音軌混音互動盤前面先是調整了幾顆球的位置，而感應器會依據位置改變節拍的頻率和節奏，隨著兩個八拍的反覆播放，可以輕易編出稍有節奏感的背景音樂。而後進了他們的展區，才發現這並不是一家音樂新創，而是北歐那斯達克(NASDAQ OMX)的上市公司，一家跨足工業解決方案、雲端儲存與數位諮詢的資通訊公司Tieto Oyj，他先介紹了赫爾辛基的能源管理服務，監控離峰與尖峰時段的電力配置，同時我們也聊到台灣近期公投的議題，因為芬蘭目前已有四座運轉中的核能發電模組，供應全國將近三成的電力需求，他也如實的說政府計畫在Olkiluoto與Hanhikivi兩地續建新的反應爐，在2025年預計提升至六成的發電總量，同時減少對於燃煤與燃氣的比重，也就是減少對於俄羅斯的能源依賴。另外我也在歐洲太空總署(European Space Agency)的攤位前遇到熱情的參展人，跟我介紹他們利用衛星監看泰國的河川流量變化，藉以預警曼谷潛在的洪水入侵，是與政府合作的一個成功案例。在全球盛名的新創論壇SLUSH，我們的科技大國當然不會缺席，參展攤位是由經濟部選出的潛力新創企業所佈展，我也跟兩家企業的參展者聊了自家的產品與服務，分別為防近視智能筆以及天晴青年旅店，前者研發一款偵測過度寫字角度與身體傾角以收回筆頭的智能筆，同時限制在低光源的環境下使用；後者是注重隱私的青年旅館，比起歐洲常見的三十床混宿房間，他們只提供雙人到六人的上下鋪房間，讓亞洲旅客安心入住。 短短的兩天要體驗所有的會場特色，我覺得我連一半都無法達成，例如官方企業媒合(Matchmaking)的線上平台，給予志工與新創與會投資客等交流機會，在SLUSH的系統內填寫自己的專業、經驗與想要工作的產業與角色，就可以瀏覽各個潛在合夥人的檔案，並直接送出會議洽談邀請，成功媒合後在會場區域(Meeting Area)就可以安排時段使用官方的小型面試空間。雖然我這次沒有嘗試這項功能，不過我的交換生志工朋友(非歐盟公民)，面試成功的例子可以讓大家當作參考，他是碩士班的資料科學家，預計在明年六月畢業，而應徵上了挪威新創的科技長位置，在撰寫畢業論文同時處理工作簽證，我也期待在近期內聽到他的更多好消息。會期的大量周邊活動(Side events)，我也因為排班時間錯過許多節目，像是台灣新創競技場(Taiwan Startup Stadium)與芬蘭的創業加速器中心Maria 01合作推出台灣芬蘭發表日的活動(Taiwan x Finland Demo Day)，讓十組新創一同交流展示服務。 前面談了那麼多的場內場外大小活動，接下來再回到志工的日常，還有如何準備這幾天的吃住等細節問題。我們排班的時間都有些許空檔可以用餐，組長會負責盒裝的簡餐，不過在志工訓練當天會拿到另外的一張餐券，在會場的二樓自助餐使用，瑞典肉丸是少不了的，還有各式沙拉吧，不過有時間效期的限制，像我拿到的是晚班的餐券，使用時間約是九點至凌晨一點。除此之外，志工休息區備有簡單的食物跟飲品，像是堅果、洋芋片、香蕉或是咖啡跟氣泡飲料等，而新奇的食物也有，如花椰菜鹹派(Broccoli quiche)。不定時也會出現棉花糖的融絲機，志工可以手作纏繞自己的粉色棉花糖。會場覓食也是一個選擇，需要大排長龍的甘草糖(Liquorice)口味冰淇淋或是碰巧遇到發放肉桂捲的與會者也都是刺激味蕾的好方式。 關於住宿的部分，主辦單位只有提供志工住宿的建議，兩個選項都是青年旅館，一是會期三日的宿舍床位，地點離會場只需要十分鐘的軌道電車，三晚大概五十歐元；二是一整周的市區青旅，搭乘同一班軌道電車需要約半小時的時間，七晚約一百八十歐元。而關於交通，包含會前訓練與會期總共三天的行程，主辦單位會提供赫爾辛基區域交通局HSL (Helsingin Seudun Liikenne)的三日交通卡，可以搭乘赫爾辛基市區的大眾運輸工具如軌道電車、火車、公車以及捷運，從會場到市區可以選擇7號軌道電車或是密集的火車直達車。如果後續的行程也需要搭乘，可以買七十二小時的三日票，十八歐元，換算下來一天搭乘超過三趟，價值就超過手機購買每張二歐二十分的電子單程票券。 會期結束後的第一天(Dec. 6th)剛好是芬蘭獨立日，也適逢赫爾辛基中央圖書館(Helsingin keskustakirjasto Oodi)對外開幕的第二日。 三層樓的空間擠滿了各個年齡層的家庭成員，從入口停放的嬰兒車數量就能探出端倪，頂樓的玻璃帷幕內部是藏書超過一萬本的開架室，同時包含一個小舞台與一個講座空間，當天有童書故事時間和小提琴演奏，讓小孩與小小孩自由的在舞台前或坐或躺度過午後時光。我在翻閱書籍時也發現芬蘭人對性別平等教育的重視，中央區域的書櫃有幾排貼上彩虹標籤的英文書與芬蘭文書，這樣的題材能增進讀者對己身的性別意識。二樓則是多以工作室型態，多台3D印表機與裁縫機，讓樂於手作的市民可以不受手邊缺乏工具的限制。最後，一樓不意外的是設置茶點桌椅區，在芬蘭也能體會到瑞典式的Fika咖啡文化。中午過後人數抵達參訪上限，隨即管理入口的人流，讓進出的人數平衡，同時也能看到兩個出入口都排了超過百人的隊伍，讓我有種回到家鄉的錯覺。 芬蘭人慶祝獨立日的方式很平靜，夜幕低垂的時刻，即使還不到四點，學生舉著火把從郊區墓園旁的小教堂開始遊行，一路朝著市中心前進，繞過總統官邸後，在赫爾辛基主教座堂(Helsinki Cathedral)前面聚集，唱著聖歌(Choral singing)接著聽取市長的演說，也就是前天登上SLUSH恆綠舞台的座談人之一，不過如同芬蘭人含蓄的個性，整場遊行非常安靜，我參與了部分的路段，沒有聽到任何口號，也沒有施放狼煙的火炬。至於當天其他的利益團體是否也有上街頭抗議與示威，我本身只有目睹反法西斯團體高舉布條呼喊口號，內容是自由、友誼與團結(Vapaus, Toveruus & Solidaarisuus)，周圍雖然有警車戒備，但氣氛並不緊張，因為我們可以看到很多警員其實是拿著手機或是相機對著群眾拍照。雖然我沒有看到極右團體的出現，但是隔天的新聞也報導了示威中揮舞的右旋萬字旗(Swastika flags)被沒收並且有四人因此被羈押，隨後也遭各界嚴厲譴責。然而，我認為整體的氣氛也就如同另一項芬蘭傳統一樣沉著，即獨立日接見典禮(Linnan Juhlat)，超過千名的重要貢獻人士會被邀請至總統府，排成兩列緩緩前進一一與總統和第一夫人握手，不過這樣的節目卻能超過兩百萬人的收看，以總人口五百五十多萬人的芬蘭而言，我認為這是極高的比例。 為了讓遠道而來的國際志工能對北歐創業圈有更多了解，SLUSH也提供了國際志工周的行程，參訪了創業加速器，並且到當地新創的工作環境，與員工面對面談論開發產品的願景及未來的產業影響。大會結束後兩天是新創的參訪，第一站來到Maria 01，也就是三天前台灣芬蘭發表日的合作夥伴，他們是創立於2016年的非營利組織，志在打造一個北歐最大的新創校園，而場地就選在超過百年歷史的一座醫院遺址，而市政府也同意他們的企劃。取名來自於原本醫院的名字(Maria Hospital)，後面加上零一的靈感來自於風險資本家彼得提爾(Peter Thiel)的暢銷書。 而目前一萬兩千平方公尺占地的工作空間已容納九十家新創公司，活絡的氣氛讓人很難想像這裡曾經是一座醫院，除了不定時在官方帳號限時動態發佈他們在地底通道又發現幾張遺棄的病床。 而後我們到了當地的風險資本(Venture Capital)企業MAKI.VC，雖然是2018年一月才開始注資的基金，但已手握八千萬歐元，投入三十家新創，而其中之一就是我前面寫到的虛擬實境公司Glue。在聽取財務長的簡報時，我們才逐漸了解獨角獸企業的概念，也就是在上市櫃前即估值超過十億美元的新創公司。而風險資本家投資標的就是找尋下一隻獨角獸，因為資本公司的投資報酬並不是計算每個項目的利潤，而是只要有一家明星標的的高報酬可以覆蓋其他虧損的新創，整體策略就算成功，因此獨角獸對於整個新創圈的投資氛圍是很重要的。最後一站，我們到了新創網路銀行Holvi，與我們常見到來自英國的Revolut或是Monzo以及來自德國的N26單純的消費金融卡不一樣，因為他們目標客群是線上購物商的經營者，也就是加強收款的功能，讓中小企業主給與消費者更多的付款選項，此外還有一個特點是他們與愛沙尼亞的電子公民計畫(e-Residency)有身份驗證的合作，如果使用者並非目前營運國家如芬蘭、德國與奧地利等的居民，可以運用電子公民的選項，而填寫其他地區的住址。 在芬蘭一周的尾聲，是在周六晚上的志工專屬會後派對(Volunteer afterparty)，但是這次不像四天前官方的會後派對在主會場的巨大場地舉辦，而是移到郊區的改建倉庫活動場館，前身是國家鐵路局的火車頭生產廠房。派對的性質則是與先前相似，有廣大舞池與DJ台，飲品也是似曾相識的琴酒長飲、蘋果酒和拉格啤酒。 不過整場派對最大的不同是，這次在工作崗位上的都不是先前看到的志工，而是指派工作給我們的頭仔，也就是在志工手冊上面看得到照片的大人物。當我們走進衣帽間準備領取號碼牌時就看到整場論壇的執行長，或是排隊領取盒裝食物時就是從營運長的手中接過泰式炒麵。這也是我整場旅程中對於芬蘭平等文化的最深刻印證，不論頭銜或是資歷，於不同時段在團隊中相互合作，切換工作角色以增進同理心，共同提升顧客體驗，也讓我想起十一月拿到的手冊中，他們花了三頁的篇幅敘述志工應該展現的正向態度，並且詳列行為準則，嚴禁各種形式的歧視，都是為了打造友善包容的組織文化以及優質的工作環境。 一場看似能夠濃縮成兩天的大型活動，我認為用兩周的時間都無法路過每個攤位，或是僅僅了解每個區域的功能。而赫爾辛基也是，一周的時間無法見到她的全貌，這是我第三次拜訪辛基，但仍然是每天在不同角落發現嶄新世界。踏上歸途之前發現行李箱多了三本新創產業的出版品，分別是《Startup Guide Nordics》、《CoFounder: The SLUSH 2018 How To Pitch, Succeed & Win Issue》、《The State of European Tech》，完整消化應該是幾個月之後的事了，文章打到這裡也超過九千字了，最後做個簡短的收尾。希望計畫前往北歐創業圈發展的朋友能在論壇中找到合夥人或是天使投資人，也希望其他單純逛展的學生能認識新朋友也對北歐創業圈有多一點了解。歡迎讀者在下方留言，點擊掌聲或是分享給更多朋友。 -- -- Wes Conference Review

Or at the very least, certainly the most influential. If you doubt that fact, consider this: Shortly after its release, the iPhone was almost unanimously viewed as the gold standard for smartphones. As a result, many other companies looked to Apple for hints at what consumer and mobile technology could and would become. And by mimicking Apple’s products in the hope of competing, those companies ultimately reinforced Apple’s vision for the future. In short, we’re living in a world where many of the products we use today, whether they have an Apple logo or not, were made in Apple’s image. But 2018 hasn’t been the best year for Apple, especially where the iPhone is concerned. After several generations of the same form factor and tired design, Apple unveiled the iPhone X as the next evolution of the iPhone. One of the most polarizing characteristics is the removal of the home button. To compensate, iOS gained a new gesture-based UI in an effort to bring us closer to the dream of an all-screen slab than we’d ever been. Though the new gesture controls and form factor made it somewhat polarizing at first, many reviews praised the iPhone X, calling it “the smartphone of the future.” In fact, there was so much excitement regarding what the iPhone X said about the future of the smartphone that at the start of 2018, the hype was only just starting to dissipate. Since we’ve turned a corner into the new year, it’s time to look back on Apple’s biggest hardware and software launches of 2018, paying particular attention to the mistakes that are obvious with the benefit of hindsight while also giving Apple due credit for several successes. The HomePod was supposed to be Apple’s answer to voice assistant-powered smart speakers like the Amazon Echo and Google Home. Originally announced in June 2017 for a December release, HomePod ended up getting delayed until its eventual launch in February. Unfortunately for Apple, once the HomePod was released and its limitations became clear, there simply wasn’t as much hype for the HomePod as there had been for the iPhone X. As a product, HomePod is only appealing if you’re already deeply ingrained in Apple’s ecosystem. HomePod is, as a product, only appealing to consumers who are already deeply ingrained in Apple’s ecosystem. Siri is the sole voice assistant on offer here and she’s proven, time and again, to be far less capable than the Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa by no small margin. [Just read “Apple’s Siri is an Embarrassment,” published by Forbes, if you don’t believe me.] Worst of all, HomePod lacks basic functions that competing high-end smart speakers have been offering, and much of that is due to the ineptitude of Siri. However, beyond the fact that Siri gets outclassed by all three of her main competitors when it comes to answering questions, most smart speakers let you connect multiple units simultaneously for stereo sound. While this was originally marketed as something HomePod could do, the feature wasn’t available out-of-the-box. Anyone who purchased more than one HomePod unit at launch soon discovered they needed AirPlay 2 for stereo sound and multi-room audio. In a review for CNET, Megan Wollerton highlighted another major drawback to the HomePod. Though she commended the HomePod for its incredible audio quality, making it a great speaker for audiophiles, Wollerton pointed out how HomePod has native support only for Apple’s own streaming music service, Apple Music. Spotify, Pandora, and other popular music streaming services — which are more ubiquitous than Apple Music — weren’t available without using AirPlay as a workaround. Normally, a speaker that doesn’t offer native support for your desired streaming service would offer a work-around with Bluetooth, but that’s not an option here. Just to be totally clear, let me state this clearly… Apple HomePod doesn’t have Bluetooth. For some reason, Bluetooth 5 is, in fact, listed among HomePod’s specifications although Android and Windows devices can’t leverage the Bluetooth to connect to HomePod. To use HomePod, you must have an iOS device. Assuming you have an iPhone, you could theoretically use AirPlay to push music from Spotify or your other music streaming service of choice to the HomePod, but for the steep price of $349 — which is higher than any Amazon Echo speaker but less than the Google Home Max — HomePod has niche appeal at best and is just too limited to truly be a smart speaker. Needless to say, it didn’t appear on many holiday wishlists. [Side note: Apple has continued updating HomePod’s software throughout the year. For what it’s worth, HomePod now offers better integration with other Apple products like Apple TV. It also now offers the ability to pair two HomePods for stereo sound with AirPlay 2, integration with your calendar, and several other features that, honestly, should’ve been available from launch.] In hindsight, the education-focused event held in Chicago in March 2018 ended up being one of Apple’s best moments of the year from a critical standpoint, so I’m including it here to give credit where credit’s due. However, there’s really not a ton to talk about. At the event, Apple unveiled the “New iPad,” revealing the long-awaited addition of Apple Pencil support, which makes the 2018 iPad newly relevant for educational uses. Best of all, you could buy the newest Pencil-compatible iPad for as little as $329, making it the lowest-priced device in Apple’s current hardware lineup. So, yes, this was certainly one of the bright spots of Apple’s year. There’s not much to say about the launch of PRODUCT(RED) versions of the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, either, besides Apple’s frustrating decision not to give iPhone X the PRODUCT(RED) treatment. The release of PRODUCT(RED) iPhones is bittersweet. Sure, they look really cool, but the spiffy red color doesn’t necessarily warrant waiting months to upgrade. If you like PRODUCT(RED) devices but didn’t want to wait for one, you might be tempted to buy your device a second time when the PRODUCT(RED) version finally hits shelves. Delaying PRODUCT(RED) releases feels like a last ditch effort to boost iPhone sales before everyone becomes fixated on the next model. I can only think of one real reason why Apple didn’t just release the PRODUCT(RED) iPhone 8s at the time of the iPhone 8 launch. Delaying PRODUCT(RED) releases feels like a last ditch effort by Apple to boost iPhone sales before everyone becomes fixated on the next generation that’s right around the corner. The omission of the iPhone X from the PRODUCT(RED) lineup was leaked in advance, so while it wasn’t really a surprise, the exlusion was a huge oversight on Apple’s part, not to mention a missed opportunity. With a portion of proceeds from each PRODUCT(RED) purchase being donated to a great cause, it probably would’ve pushed some iPhone X holdouts over the edge; however, since the iPhone X was more expensive to manufacture, it’s likely Apple probably didn’t want (RED) donations eating into their per-unit revenue. Again, I want to give credit where credit is due, and the long-awaited AirPlay 2 was a highlight of 2018. AirPlay is Apple’s proprietary wireless technology for streaming media between Apple devices. Traditionally, AirPlay was designed for use with music, video, and gaming, but there were inherent limitations — particularly regarding latency and a general lack of utility— that restricted AirPlay’s usefulness. Originally intended to be baked into iOS 11, AirPlay 2 was delayed so Apple could further refine HomePod and its multi-room audio capabilities. Originally intended to be baked into iOS 11, AirPlay 2 was delayed so Apple could spend more time refining the HomePod and fine-tuning its multi-room audio capabilities. Then AirPlay 2 was finally released in May 2018, which was mere days before the first beta of iOS 12 was unveiled. When it was finally released, AirPlay 2 was a welcome improvement and delivery on promises that had been made since before iOS 11. [Side note: As mentioned previously, AirPlay 2 was designed with the HomePod in mind since it allows you to connect two HomePods simultaneously for stereo sound.] In terms of hardware, Apple played it close to the vest at WWDC 2018 in June. Of course, WWDC is a software-focused event, so Apple took the opportunity to unveil software that would pave the way for the remainder of the year. Most of Apple’s WWDC coverage was positive, especially when it came to iOS, tvOS, and macOS. On the mobile side, Apple was universally praised for the work that went into iOS 12. Of course, the company really needed this win to help weather a pretty serious storm. In late 2017, users discovered their older iPhones were getting throttled, meaning processor performance was intentionally reduced. Amidst accusations of planned obsolescence — in other words, intentionally slowing down older phones, which essentially forces users to buy new devices — Apple said the purpose of doing this was actually to maintain user experience. According to Apple, iPhones with old batteries could experience random shutdowns if their processors continue maxing their respective clock speeds. So Apple quietly lowered those processors’ performance caps. In hindsight, the fact that Apple wasn’t transparent with the practice of limited processor speeds on older iPhone devices is surely what rubbed users the wrong way. Then iOS 12 came into the picture. Both the industry and consumers were extremely impressed with what Apple delivered in iOS 12. The company reportedly dedicated a ton of resources to this version of iOS so it would work exceptionally well on older devices. Suddenly, older iPhones like the iPhone 5S and iPhone 6 had new life. [Side note: It’s very possible — perhaps even likely — that the performance improvements iOS 12 brought to older iPhones contributed to the lackluster sales of 2018 iPhones, too.] With both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos support, Apple TV 4K is competitive and ideal for home theater setups. Though it shipped with Dolby Vision support, Apple TV 4K notably lacked Dolby Atmos support. Fortunately, tvOS 12 rectified this omission by bringing support for both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. In turn, Apple TV 4K has become much more competitive among streaming hardware and is particularly appealing to home theater connoisseurs. For the Mac, Apple unveiled macOS 10.14 Mojave, which notably brought system-wide dark mode — for which users had long been begging — to macOS for the first time. There were a slew of other additions and improvements besides dark mode, too; in particular, Mojave brings a revamped App Store, a new Home app, and dozens of welcome quality-of-life changes. Since the first Touchbar-sporting MacBrook Pros launched in 2016, Apple has released a new MacBook Pro each year. I personally think it’s because the MacBook Pro is one of Apple’s best-selling personal computing device — though I don’t currently have concrete numbers to verify this — so it behooves the company to keep the people buying these uber-expensive powerbooks happy. The 2016 MacBook Pro received mixed reactions. Though the design and build quality were praised (which is typical for Apple products), the MacBook Pro 2016 lost all I/O but a couple USB C ports, forcing buyers — largely professionals and power users who probably relied on all those ports — to adjust to “dongle life.” Then there’s the fact that the new MacBook Pro was technically outdated at launch, built on sixth-generation processors while competitors were offering the newer seventh-gen Intel “Kaby Lake” chipsets. In 2017, Apple addressed this gripe by updating the MacBook Pro again, offering the Kaby Lake chips to further boost the notebook’s power. So after last refreshing the MacBook Pro in 2012, we got two consecutive updates in 2016 and 2017. Apple has set a precedent for annual MacBook Pro updates, which could make it harder for consumers to buy a new MacBook Pro since a better model is always within reach. That’s why it was so surprising for Apple to update the MacBook Pro again at the tail end of July 2018. On the one hand, Apple has set a precedent for annual MacBook Pro updates, so we shouldn’t be surprised when it happens in 2019. On the other hand, these annual upgrades make it harder to buy a new MacBook Pro because you’re never more than 12 months from an even better version. And a MacBook Pro is no small investment. In the positive column, the MacBook Pro 2018 features Intel’s eighth-generation processor, so it’s an even better workhorse for anyone who needs power on the go. Specifically, this new MacBook Pro is great for graphic design, video editing, music production, and other intensive tasks. MacBook Pro 2018 features Apple’s T2 security chip. This is the first time Apple has put their own custom silicon in a Mac. The new MacBook Pro also features Apple’s T2 chip, which is an important moment in tech history as this is the first time Apple’s has put their own silicon in a Mac. Granted, the T2 chip deals primarily with security and biometric authentication via the TouchID sensor, so it’s not as exciting as, say, Apple’s A4 chip was in 2010. But when you consider the huge lead Apple has gained in smartphone performance by producing their own mobile processors, it’ll be interesting to see how long it takes for Apple to start making processors for their laptops and desktops in-house. Other new features added to the 2018 MacBook Pro include TrueTone display and native Siri support. You may recall that TrueTone debuted on the iPhone X, allowing for on-the-fly display recalibration that adjusts to the color temperature of your environment. Then Siri is… well, Siri, but now the MacBook Pro has support for “Hey Siri” just like an iPhone or iPad. Beyond the obligatory processor upgrade, the inclusion of Apple’s T2 chip, and a couple software tweaks here or there, the 2018 MacBook Pro was simply a slightly-improved version of the 2017 MacBook Pro. If the spec bump wouldn’t yield noticeable improvements in your workflow — which, again, is probably only significant for video editing and other intensive processes — the MacBook Pro 2018 probably isn’t all that exciting for most people. As in previous years, Apple kicked off the fall season with the company’s annual iPhone event at the Steve Jobs Theater on the new Cupertino campus. Whatever Apple planned to release in 2018 was inevitably going to pale in comparison to the iPhone X. To be fair, there really wasn’t much Apple could’ve done to top the iPhone X from the previous year. With 2018 being an “S” year, meaning incremental upgrades with largely the same form factor, whatever Apple was planning to release would inevitably pale in comparison to the hype and excitement that had surrounded the iPhone X. In the months leading to the event, numerous leaks spoiled those revelations. News of three iPhone models had been making the rounds; two of those iPhones were direct successors to the iPhone X, one with the same 5.8-inch OLED display and one with a larger 6.5-inch OLED display. The third device was the hotly-anticipated budget version of the iPhone X. Nobody could be certain what it would be called, but it was pegged to land in-between the two iPhone X successors in terms of screen size, sporting a 6.1-inch (likely LCD) display. Sure enough, at the event on September 12, Apple unveiled the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and the iPhone XR with the latter being the budget-conscious version marketed as “the new generation of iPhone.” Unfortunately, the price hikes of 2017 continued in 2018. The iPhone XS had the same starting price of the iPhone X at $999 in the US. If you wanted the bigger version, the starting price was $1099 and could climb as high as $1,449 for 512 GB of storage. The iPhone XR seemed cheap by comparison even though its starting price of $749 was already higher than mid-range Android phones like the OnePlus 6 ($529). All three of the 2018 iPhones featured the buttonless, FaceID-centric design that debuted with the iPhone X, eliminating the design language that debuted with the iPhone 6. Additionally, all three models features the same impressive A12 Bionic processor, meaning that you’re getting the same industry-leading power no matter the price tier you choose. The general public had several key issues with the 2018 iPhones. First, there’s the price creep. With the smartphone industry as a whole tending to follow Apple’s lead, smartphones hitting or even surpassing the $1,000 price point is becoming disturbingly common in the wake of the iPhone X. Then there’s the fact that none of the 2018 iPhones have TouchID fingerprint sensors, which had been a popular iPhone feature since the iPhone 5S debuted in 2013. TouchID wasn’t just fast, it was familiar. Apple should’ve had at least one transitional generation of iPhone that offered both TouchID and FaceID instead of immediately forcing FaceID’s learning curve onto buyers. It’s one thing to eliminate the fingerprint sensor in favor of facial recognition on a device that’s intentionally experimental like the iPhone X; however, it would have been smart to have at least one generation of transitional iPhone that offered both TouchID and FaceID instead of pulling the rug out from beneath buyers, forcing the slight learning curve of a brand new security method onto them. Having controversially discontinued the iPhone SE, iPhone XR might’ve been Apple’s saving grace if the device hadn’t started on the wrong foot. In particular, the iPhone XR’s display — an 828 x 1792 “Liquid Retina” LCD at 326 pixels per inch (PPI) — was considered by the majority of critics and tech journalists to be way too low for a 2018 flagship, and nearly as much of a deal-breaker for prospective buyers as the high cost of the iPhone XS and XS Max. Though many tech critics and reviewers would come to praise the iPhone XR and its display once they got their hands on the device, it’s likely the damage had already been done. It left users with two choices: Pony up for thousand-dollar iPhones or hang onto their previous-generation iPhones. If reports from Apple’s supply chain are any indication, a lot of people chose the latter. Alongside the new iPhones launched at the fall event, Apple introduced what could be considered Apple’s “sleeper hit” of 2018: the Apple Watch Series 4. Apple Watch has long been the gold standard for wearables, and it’s only gotten better with each generation. With the Series 4, Apple flexed its muscles, making a great product even better — and, more specifically, even more relevant — by adding some pretty groundbreaking health features. The new Apple Watch has a feature called “fall detection,” which is exactly what it sounds like. If the person wearing the watch takes a serious spill, the watch will give that person the ability to easily call for emergency services. Besides the fall detection, the Apple Watch Series 4 also brings electrocardiograph (ECG) capabilities to a wearable device for the first time. It’s works pretty brilliantly: Just put your finger on the watch’s digital crown to “close the circuit” and allow the Apple Watch to read your heart rhythm. Apple Watch Series 4 has become a legitimate medical diagnostic device. On paper, this makes the Apple Watch Series 4 a legitimate medical diagnostic device that will determine which type of heart rhythm you have and could, in theory, detect a condition like atrial fibrillation. Looking back, the Apple Watch Series 4 is arguably one of Apple’s strongest products of the year. If it weren’t for wearables being practically passé at this point, the Apple Watch Series 4 would’ve been a much bigger seller. But wait, there’s more. As we neared the holiday season, Apple announced the next-generation iPad Pro to mixed reactions. There’s no denying the new iPad Pro is a capable device. With slimmed bezels, FaceID, and a new utilitarian design language that’s reminiscent of the iPhone 5 era of Apple design, the new iPad Pro is inarguably the most powerful tablet on the market. Benchmarks have shown the A12X Bionic chip in the 2018 iPad Pro shatters records, raising the bar in terms of how much power a tablet computer can offer. And it’s not just the single-core scores impressive; the iPad Pro’s multi-core benchmarks rival even high-end laptop computers. There are two major problems with the iPad Pro 2018: price and the inherent limitations of iOS. So what’s the problem? Well, there are two. First, the iPad Pro is held back by the high cost. At a starting price of $799, the cost of the iPad Pro is comparable to what you could pay for a similarly-specced Windows laptop. It comes down to this: Who’s going to pay $800 or more for a tablet? If you’re hoping for the iPad Pro to be a productivity machine, you’ll have to throw down some serious cash: The Apple Pencil, which is basically a required accessory to really get the most out of the iPad Pro, also got a second generation with an accompanying price hike. Whereas it previously cost $99, the second-generation Apple Pencil retails for $129. Adding a keyboard, case, and the new Apple Pencil (because the first-gen Pencil won’t work with the new iPad Pro) to a 12.9-inch Wifi-only 64 GB iPad Pro, you’re looking at investing well over $1,200. For a tablet. But if you want to get a higher storage option, you’re easily crossing into MacBook Pro price territory. And don’t even get me started on the fact that the new iPad Pro doesn’t work with the first-generation Apple Pencil; Apple is strong-arming you into buying the newer and needlessly more expensive expensive version. The other major issue holding the iPad Pro back is iOS. Even with the industry-leading benchmarks, all that power is for nought if the operating system doesn’t let you to harness that power or take advantage of it in meaningful ways. As it stands, the iPhone’s mobile operating system just isn’t robust enough to take full advantage of the iPad Pro’s incredibly processing power. Plus, in the absence of support for external storage devices, a decent file management system, and support for desktop-class applications, the iPad Pro remains essentially a glorified media and web browsing machine. Assuming there are apps available to give you the functionality needed to be truly productive on the iPad Pro, again, you’re paying nearly the same cost as a decently-specced MacBook Pro, so what’s the point? The 2018 iPad Pro ended up being a powerful tablet that everyone would love to own and play with, but few can justify its price. There are just a few particular instances when an iPad Pro is a reasonable purchase; for instance, there’s a lot here for illustrators and artists to love. Otherwise, the iPad Pro serves as clear indication of how the future of computing isn’t quite ready to become our present. It was a long time coming, but Apple finally updated its lowest-cost Apple PC. And yes, the price of the Mac Mini increased, too. Before November 2018, Apple had last shown the Mac Mini love in 2014. Among its Mac lineup, the Mini was conceptualized as a budget-friendly, lower-powered option, ideal for home servers, as family PCs, or for less demanding tasks. But after four years, Mac Mini could no longer keep up. The new Mac Mini is a modern entry-level desktop in almost every sense of the word. Updated with Apple’s Thunderbolt USB-C ports and an optional 10-gigabit ethernet port, the Mini checks most boxes that are essential in 2019, bringing the miniaturized desktop up to snuff with competitors. At its unveiling, the new Mac Mini was a welcome improvement, but it hasn’t been without its problems. Apple has made the Mini non-user-upgradeable, which continues to be a point of contention for users. But Apple has thrown users a bone: It is technically possible to upgrade the RAM or SSD in your Mac Mini, but it has to be done by a technician at your nearest Apple Store. If you were hoping to use a Mac Mini for video editing, gaming, or other intensive tasks, you’ll probably need an external GPU. If you had hoped to use a Mini in lieu of an iMac for video editing, gaming, or other intensive tasks, be aware that the Mac Mini’s GPU is pretty lackluster. You’ll probably be shopping for an external GPU sooner than later. Perhaps the most controversial move was the price hike, a common refrain in 2018. Whereas the Mac Mini previously started at an entry-friendly price of $499, the 2018 Mac Mini starts at $799, which is an increase of nearly 40 percent. Admittedly, it’s not terrible value for what you’re getting, but the increased price puts it within throwing distance of more capable, powerful hardware like the MacBook Pro. So if you’re planning on getting a Mini and even considering upgrading its specs, you’re probably better off skipping the Mini altogether and getting a base model MacBook Pro or iMac that’s simply more capable. It’s clear that 2018 was a pretty rough year for Apple overall. The products — and the hardware in particular — Apple released throughout 2018 are great, but with the prices ballooning year over year, Apple needs to step back and really reconsider what kind of value these devices are bringing. Is it enough to warrant such high costs? Beyond the lackluster iPhone releases and the controversial HomePod, we’re still waiting for AirPower, the wireless charging pad announced during the iPhone X event in 2017 and originally slated for a 2018 release. We’re also still waiting for a follow-up to the Apple’s extremely popular AirPods. But there have been some wins, too. iOS 12 is more polished and capable than ever. The Apple Watch Series 4 is literally saving lives. The iPad Pro 2018 is posting benchmarks many laptops can only dream of hitting. Apple took buyers for granted, failing to provide compelling reasons or incentive to invest in new products. Unfortunately, most consumers don’t care about these landmark achievements, and Apple took for granted that the newest shiny toy with the Apple logo on it would be enough to buy. With most of Apple’s 2018 product releases, the problem is that Apple isn’t providing compelling reasons or incentive for consumers to buy new models instead of keeping what they already have. For 2019, I’d like to see Apple rein in the price hikes; it’s getting to the point where it’s hard to recommend Apple’s incredible products when the pricing is obscene and turns most people off buying new Apple products altogether. Moreover, I’d like to see Apple do something unique with the 2019 iPhones, something to renew excitement for Apple and re-secure its position at the front of the technology pack. -- -- 4 DataDrivenInvestor Designer & Creative Strategist, 10+ Years Building Brands & Digital Experiences | Covers Design, Marketing, Tech, Education, Entertainment & Business Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/0*ki1D3pkQEDsymsLd', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*gupdAMQBVBj4Pomo4hfoAg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2160/1*T5kDuHRr3sM8ysYwszGxZQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*hyTelTt94TRDB-g8A4aZWw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*gACGrkLg_gSxAX8tLvcAlA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1500/1*gfzF9c5JRE2GCPx8970amQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*RbxT2jWKAM5en8sepKRvWw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*97I50S_95pvHX4VECAxmyA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*6Z8-3mTTqEF1ht82h0aUlg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1500/1*yirpInYBZe3_sbj_Dyfn3Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*4eMUdpsklsdbRT2XIdBiaw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*sVLxFvcB3yYlAzBoom_juQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*dgHmu0eYprOXltLlvd30UQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*gupdAMQBVBj4Pomo4hfoAg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*t9dv394rc8dv84ygoxjn3w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*gupdAMQBVBj4Pomo4hfoAg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*vcNoq0SDXBl7nqnzNaSr7A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*xiFRgHfgfMR7S111UB2hMw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*RQ6IU5ZQqoSQocDbSyjC0A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*6mgEZmtgEIYKM-aqXYAgMA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*StUuQvvfQS5rAn73g1XZGw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*gupdAMQBVBj4Pomo4hfoAg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*_wvc1IOHe1qT5s7-hNm2JQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*wzwnJD8UpPtAd2YoIPEiNQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*TcF9rICJPQZsrzNignSvgw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*-Y9ozbNWSViiCmal1TT32w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*AscZbV1rFfGzqjJX8ofzNw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg']",1-Jan-19,https://medium.comhttps://daneoleary.medium.com/?source=post_page-----21a06d1f82db--------------------------------,0,19 min read

Og — selvfølgelig skjedde det … 2412 ting i React-verdenen! <ForrigeUke /> er en artikkelserie som oppsummerer hva som skjedde i React-økosystemet i uken som var (og i denne spesialutgaven, de to siste ukene). React-året oppsummert Jeg hadde egentlig tenkt å skrive noe lignende selv, men Harry Wolff slo meg på målstreken. Unge herr Wolff har skrevet en flott oppsummering av de største eventsa i React-året 2018, som er tilgjengelig både i video- og tekstform. hswolff.com Det var selvfølgelig haugevis av andre ting som skjedde i år også, og du kan finne mesteparten av dem ved å lese deg gjennom resten av årets <ForrigeUke />-er: blogg.bekk.no Blir du også av og til litt sjokkert over hvor unge noen av disse superstjerne-utviklerne vi ofte tillegger så mye kunnskap er? James Kyle (kjent fra Parcel, Babel etc) er 25, Ives van Hoorne (skaperen av CodeSandbox) er 22, og Dan Abramov er 26 (!). Vel, jeg har litt dårlige nyheter til deg. Revel er en 9 år gammel gutt som elsker React, og som akkurat holdt sin første talk på React NYC Meetup! Her prater han om hooks som en sjef, og er full av flotte sitat og kunnskap! Jeg tror ikke jeg kunne vært så rolig foran så mange mennesker! Se talken under, og følg han på Twitter-kontoen hans (kurert av faren hans). Føler du også på at alle kan alt, og at du kan ingenting? Velkommen i klubben. Få bransjer beveger seg like fort, med like mange deleglade profesjonelle som IT, og det er lett å få inntrykk av at mengden man må kunne for å i det hele tatt føle seg som en middels vellykket utvikler, er helt uangripelig. Heldigvis er det en kollektiv løgn. Du er flink — og du blir flinkere for hver dag som går! Hvis du ikke er sikker på sistnevnte — se på kode du skrev for 6 måneder siden. 🙈 Dan Abramov er en kjekk kar som halve internett (undertegnede inkludert) evangeliserer som en slags superstjerne. Da er det ekstra godt å føle på at selv Danny Dan ikke kan alt — og at det er okei! Han har nemlig skrevet en flott artikkel der han nevner en del ting han selv ikke er veldig komfortabel med. Artikkelen påstår basically at det er naturlig å ha visse gap i kunnskapen sin, og at man ikke trenger å kunne alt i et fagfelt for å kunne bidra med faktisk verdi. Videre prater han om sine egne kunnskapsgap. overreacted.io Mens vi har lagt på oss noen kilo i romjulen, har både Parcel, Webpack og Rollup lagt på seg en major (eller begynt å nærme seg en, i alle fall). Den mest brukte bundleren på markedet — webpack — er på vei ut i ny versjon, og allerede godt i gang med alpha-testingen. Changeloggen er full av nyheter, hvor blant annet persistert caching (les: kjemperaske bygg) og såkalt hot module replacing for flere filtyper er blant de store nyhetene. Det er mange som gleder seg til den komplette redesignen av zero-config bundleren Parcel kommer ut, men den rakk dessverre ikke helt ut i 2018. Det den rakk var dog en ny minor-versjon — 1.11.0 — som blant annet inneholder HMR-støtte for Elm, samt Kotlin-støtte. I tillegg har man begynt å ta i bruk endel pakker fra Parcel 2 — så man unngår de aller største oppgraderingskostnadene! Rollup er den foretrukne bundleren for pakker i React-økosystemet, og har endelig blitt sluppet i sin første major! Du kan sjekke changeloggen for en å se hvilke breaking changes som treffer deg, men i all hovedsak så er det støtte for code-splitting som er den store nyheten her. Nå kan biblioteker kanskje splittes opp i forskjellige bundles, basert på bruksmønster? Mulighetene er ganske enorme! Det er en tjeneste som heter Mybridge, som bruker kunstig intelligens til å kompilere lister over de “beste” artiklene i en gitt kategori. De har selvfølgelig laget en årskompilasjon av React-artikler også — og her finner du mye snacks! medium.mybridge.co Du har nok sett mange av disse blitt lenket til i tidligere versjoner av <ForrigeUke /> også, men her har du i alle fall den fulle oversikten på ett sted. Det har vært en glede å skrive for dere i år. Vi i React-gruppa til Bekk er utrolig glade for at dere har fulgt oss i året som har gått, og vi gleder oss til å levere nok et innholdsrikt år i 2019. For å bli enda bedre til neste år, har vi laget et tilbakemeldingsskjema. Du fyller det ut på et minutt om du er rask (kanskje 2 om du er litt sigen etter julen), og du finner det her Tusen takk for oss! -- -- Bekk Fagsjef at Bekk Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*4Mql0_VPh_PtFqPEYIBGeQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*Ak2KDk9IgEhVYVVPQ4Fp1g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1500/0*qKxz_uI7lx7lOBVO', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*4Mql0_VPh_PtFqPEYIBGeQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*Ak2KDk9IgEhVYVVPQ4Fp1g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*tAv-SbTG5IScdzhmrqvVVw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*4Mql0_VPh_PtFqPEYIBGeQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*AFadlwGIH5latUWI3TEDAQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*4jeuXqKIyy5LMoLb.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*yuVzMhCJyDENbyhwAsrkwA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*e7IFZBFmoStkpgAp.', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*3G9B3Q7bpiuC2aeu', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*4Mql0_VPh_PtFqPEYIBGeQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*ccCr8F6SL9sdxsfp.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*abnkL8PKTea5iO2Cm5H-Zg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*yr2O5U-a0-rfY34C6yOXMw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*_3WdkzQRqIq8tt3Wh-WhbA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*6QHaAGV4bp_AAGctwP3x5w.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*4X37q9wlsqgHnYLSgmlNaA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*cBIFfjjqzx8pzaemnAM0rQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*EhiV5eo34TIkvI6u-JFYmg.jpeg']",1-Jan-19,https://medium.comhttps://medium.com/@selbekk?source=post_page-----460793b0f3ea--------------------------------,36,4 min read
Internet of Things — shaping our future today,Written by Natasha F Saxberg," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Natasha F Saxberg Follow -- 1 Listen Share Internet of Things (IoT) is a well known buzzword, many people might have heard about for a couple of decades. At same time it can be difficult to understanding what IoT actually covers and how far it is from our mass reality. IoT covers a paradigm of technologies, platforms, and industry solutions. The basic definition of IoT is connecting any- “thing” to each other and/or the Internet. This will potentially affect any object in our lives, since everything that makes sense to connect will be connected. From our leisure time to our professional setting, anything from cars, jet engines and door locks to your shoes will consist of input/output. It is already a reality. EVERYTHING THAT MAKES SENSE TO CONNECT WILL BE CONNECTED. Industry experts give competing estimates on the number of IoT devices in the future, from 20 to more than 150 billion devices in 2020. As with all other technology, the key interaction will be human, since IoT objects will not only be connected to things, but to people. Whether we use big data and artificial intelligence to make better decisions, remotely control a robot, perform heart surgery in a refugee camp, or customise our physical environment through mixed reality. While broadband Internet has become more widely available, smartphone penetration is sky-rocketing. The worldwide smartphone market will reach a total of 1.5 billion units shipped in 2016, up 5.7% from the 1.4 billion units shipped in 2015. From there, shipments will reach 1.92 billion units in 2020. And the cost of connecting people and objects is constantly decreasing, enabling the perfect storm for Internet in Things. INTERNET OF THINGS WILL NOT ONLY CHANGE HOW TECHNOLOGY AFFECTS HUMANS, BUT ENFORCE A CHANGE IN MOST POWER STRUCTURES AS WE KNOW THEM, FROM DEMOCRACY TO AUTHORITY. Through 4,5/5G and IPv6 we are entering a reality where the world will consist of a giant network of connected “things”, shaping the future of work, facilities, and megacities. In this era, we will not only see a change in our use of technology, but in most of the structures and organisations, we know today. We will need a systemic upgrade to support our exponentially intelligent future, from the power structures of politics, democracy, and geographical borders to how we educate and the future of organisations. THE IOT STACKIoT is not only technology, but a paradigm, from protocols, hardware to software. To understand IoT, one must understand the IoT Stack, and the maturity of the layers. This Thing Stack consists of three layers: sensors, microcontrollers and internet connectivity, and service platforms. The defintion of IoT is the use of intelligently connected devices and systems that can leverage data gathered by embedded sensors and operators in machines and other physical objects. In other word things that can connect and process data connected with a network. As an example a pen with a RFID tag is not IoT, because it does not connect to anything and it does not process data — it can be used as an element in an IoT solution but more intelligence is needed to be captured under the IoT umbrella. IOT WILL CHANGE OUR WORLDThe world as we know it today will change dramatically, and we all play an essential part in cultivating this future as business professionals whether we work with startups, corporations or in the public sector. I will publish a series on future scenarios of IoT, how leading innovators and companies are developing IoT solutions affecting us now as well as in the future, to inspire others who are working with emerging technologies and/or who also possess a curious mind. -- -- 1 Digital Strategist & Author of: Homo Digitalis & Twitter!

(“Lambi race ka Ghoda”) Well, Just like after every Sprint in an Agile SDLC, we do retrospection, 2018 was part of Life’s cycle, which deserves Retro. Played badminton, cricket, soccer and Tennis this year — Wow Physical fitness is as important as mental fitness. Never been so regular to Gym. This is my favorite part. Yes, more often than not. I would say most of the time is going to be spent on reading someone else’s code, cleaning somebody’s code, reading more is definitely a sign of improvement. Have you read Good/recommended books? Here are must read books. (At least good to have in your shelf) Lets be honest, you can’t know everything. But, you can try. I read tech articles, read company’s engineering blogs, medium posts. Following AWS blogs has helped me tremendously in my project’s infrastructure. I have been reading/following serverless recently. How to launch a microservice? How to launch a product? All kinds of testing- Unit, integration, performance, canaries.

Innovation Elevation: A Myth and Some Initial Observations by Isa Lacuna,"About the author:,Written by Shiela Manalo"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Shiela Manalo Follow John Clements Lookingglass -- Listen Share “A Klee painting named Angelus Novus shows an angel looking as though he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. His eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress.” - Walter Benjamin, Theses on the Philosophy of History I am hesitant to talk about “innovation” or any kind of so-called “elevation” of the term (as the theme insists, as the theme presupposes, as the theme vehemently desires) because the word is, in my osmotic understanding of the popular imagination, aggressively optimistic and naively utopic to a fault in daily use. Before, when I was still in advertising, the rallying call was always to innovate (products, mediums, taglines, points-of-purchase, packaging designs, greeting cards, literally everything we had to work on) because it is supposedly the only manner by which businesses can stay afloat and through which advertising can ‘somehow’ disseminate the never-before articulated insights of national consciousness across a whole host of massive media outlets and endless commercial seasons. Simply put, everyone is being charged with the responsibility to innovate, ceaselessly and relentlessly, across all disciplines and all positions, and part of my reluctance regarding this whole endeavor of talking about it stems from the fact that for the past few years, I and the people I work with have done nothing but talk about and be governed by the concept of innovation, to the point that not only has it become nonsensical, in the way that any word gets when it is repeated incessantly, automatically, and fervently, but also tortuous in its endlessness. As a Philippine radio station ID constantly belts out, in monotonous succession: “What is the meaning of this?”¹ One can start answering that question etymologically. Innovation as a word emerged in the mid-sixteenth century, from the Latin innovat- ‘renewed, altered’ from the verb innovare, from in- ‘into’ + novare ‘make new’ (from novus ‘new’).² Interestingly, it was first used as a kind of invective, one hurled at heretical troublemakers who refused to follow the religious doctrine held sacred by sixteenth to seventeenth century Puritans.³ The logic seems to be that one could never hope to be a good person if one was always trying to break biblical rules, and that carried a lot of weight in a European setting where people were, contextually, undergoing massive upheavals both in their religious and political structures. It was a combination of the scientific turn, the Industrial Revolution, and the rise of capitalism which redeemed “innovation” from the bottom of the metaphorical trash heap moralism had buried it in and polished it with a veneer of progressiveness. Specifically, Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter “defined invention as an act of intellectual creativity undertaken without any thought given to its possible economic import, while innovation happens when firms figure out how to craft inventions into constructive changes in their business model.”⁴ From here, economics becomes the key feature which differentiates the term from creative invention, and up until now, we still operate under the same assumption. Innovation is pointless if it does not generate some kind of profit, because then it would be similar to art, which, while uplifting, is not financially remunerative. Or, if you would like to state it in another way, you’ll find it difficult to come across anyone willing to pay you for your art, but you’ll always find someone willing to pay you if you promise them innovation. Fast forward to 1991, wherein Fredric Jameson described innovation as not only characteristic of the postmodern condition, but also as one of the beliefs that alienates us from the history of the world. “The frantic economic urgency of producing fresh waves of ever more novel-seeming goods (from clothing to airplanes), at ever greater rates of turnover, now assigns an increasingly essential structural function and position to aesthetic innovation and experimentation . . . We now inhabit the synchronic rather than the diachronic, and I think it is at least empirically arguable that our daily life, our psychic experience, our cultural languages, are today dominated by categories of space rather than by categories of time . . .”⁵ In other words, there really is nothing new about the new, or the way we think about the new. In fact, we have become so used to the concept that we live in a state where it is constantly commodified to the point that is an expectation of the everyday. Jameson’s propositions mirror the mood illustrated by Walter Benjamin’s writing on Angelus Novus, which is quoted in the very beginning of this essay. While there are some dissimilarities with regard to how they envision the shape and function of history — from Benjamin’s single catastrophe to Jameson’s ironic alternatives — both nevertheless believe that innovation without history can only produce a future more bereft, more intolerable, and more alienated to real human conditions, than the present that births it. Where does this leave us then, on the question of innovation and its supposed elevation? Let me propose some initial observations, which I hope might be food for thought in at least the next few moments: First, that as a concept, innovation has been regurgitating its own logic since the 1800s; therefore, there’s nothing really innovative about it. All of its functions, its strategies, and its consequent maneuvers, have been apparent centuries ago, but its genius lies in the way that we continue to fall for the utopic myth it has been made to represent.⁶ If one would like to “elevate” the idea of innovation (elevate, from the Latin elevat- ‘raised’; from the verb elevare — from e- (variant of ex-) ‘out, away’ + levare ‘lighten’ (from levis ‘light’)⁷, then one must first grapple with the fact that historically, nineteenth century businessmen have already “raised” the idea. Innovation is already a cultural dominant, and you would be hard pressed to find a concept more favored, or more generative of interest from all business sectors. One needs to ask, what are we elevating innovation from, and is it even necessary at this point? Innovation is already the star of the show and the world is its captive audience; what more can we possibly do for it, and does it really need to be magnified even more? Second, and implicit to this whole argument is the function of history and the genealogy of ideas. Echoing Jameson, the way we work has blurred temporal categories so much so that it seems like we are living in an eternal present, willing to deny the function of history in our everyday lives. Ahistoricity, while easy to appropriate, is riddled with ignorance and only produces short-term successes and a whole host of invisible long-term failures. Innovation, which I do not doubt must still be delivered at the end of the day, no matter how suspicious I might be of the idea, can only benefit from analyses with a longue durée in mind. Whether we are talking about the innovation of a product, a campaign, a marketing strategy, or like this article somewhat hastily attempts, the innovation of innovation itself, the capacity to think about an object as a product of time can only be generative of insight, which is a rare but truly beautiful thing nowadays. So if there is any piece of advice I can only hope to propose and with which to end this article with, it is that one try to think of things historically, in as many ways as one can. While this project might not guarantee you financial and material compensation, it does provide, in a way, a kind of personal elevation. ¹ Supposedly the punchline to a series of running gags featured on the popular Philippine FM station, 101.1 Yes FM, in the Philippines. On a good day, sometimes the joke will be funny. On a bad day, there will be no joke, only the punchline on repeat, which might be its own joke altogether. ² English Oxford Living Dictionaries, s.v. “innovate.” https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/innovate ³ Emma Green, “Innovation: The History of a Buzzword,” The Atlantic, June 20, 2013. https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/06/innovation-the-history-of-a-buzzword/277067/ ⁴ Ibid. ⁵ Fredric Jameson, “The Logic of Late Capitalism,” in Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism (Durham: Duke University Press, 1991), 4, 16. ⁶ This point does not attempt to detract from the myriad number of ways innovation continues to have a function in our lives. Take for example, the rise of the internet and the way it has redefined our conception of work. The digital network is still a product of late capital, it is still mainly a function of our desire to reap more profit by collapsing our ideas of time and space (everything should be quicker, faster, and should have a more global reach, etcetera etcetera), but definitely the paradigms by which we enact this logic are not similar to the those lived by seventeenth century peasants, the monarchists, the industrialists, or the other numerous historical demographics that have either risen or fallen in the past two centuries. ⁷ English Oxford Living Dictionaries, s.v. “elevate.” https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/elevate.

Reviews Of All The Tech I Bought In 2018,Written by mwc," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in mwc Follow -- Listen Share I hate the end of the year. This is the time when everyone else comes out with photo albums and essays detailing just how wonderful and transformative their 2018 was. I’m the same self I was 365 days ago. I spent some of those days meeting people, exploring, growing, changing, and broadening my horizons. But I spent most of them playing with tech. I’m no good at writing reflective thinkpieces, but I do know how to criticize consumer technology. So I’ve dug through my Amazon account and various bank statements to pull together a list of all the gadgets I bought this year. Here’s what I thought of it all. Surface Book 2 Story time. In August I sent my boyfriend the following request: “Please find me the cheapest place to buy the Surface Book 2.” It was finally time to break up with the Macbook Pro. I love macOS, but that keyboard is a flaming pile of flat, ugly, clickety-clackety nonsense. I’m sure Tim Cook is sobbing for the loss of my patronage. He found it, from a seller called Julitech Deals, almost $500 below MSRP. What could go wrong? I ordered it, with a core i7 and a 1050 TI. These are words that Mac-Monica would have heard as gibberish. It came in a fancy box, I unboxed it for Instagram, and I loved it the minute I opened it. I began to play real-time strategy games in bed, an activity of which Mac-Monica had dreamed, endlessly, for years on end. I even used it as a tablet once or twice. You know, just to do it. Then, about a week into my dream world, my boyfriend burst the bubble. “That thing isn’t running on a GPU,” he told me, peaking over my shoulder at my game of Civilization V. He dug into my system and, sure enough, there was no GPU to be found. I’d been scammed into purchasing the model with an i5 and integrated graphics. Julitech Deals, illustrious and established as they are, did not respond to my flurry of angry emails. Luckily, Amazon had stamped its “Fulfilled By” sticker on the brand, so we could make it their problem. Within a week, I’d returned the inferior unit, and called back the one I was supposed to have, from Amazon directly, at a much higher price. I love it. I guess the moral of the story is: Get you a man who can distinguish between Intel integrated graphics and a 1050TI on sight. Lay-N-Go Wired Tech Bag I moved to New York City to like, follow my writing dream or whatever. My cohabitants are rich, fast, and busy. They all seem to have plans, and large social networks. I’m sure they’re not actually thriving in that fast-paced mess, but god damn are they good at pretending. “I’m busy until 6, can we do 7?” “I was out with friends yesterday, and I heard…” I don’t feel like I belong there. As much as I’d like to be one of those people, I’m not. Rural Connecticut looks more alien every time I come home. The children seem younger. I recognize an old teacher (barely) and don’t say hi. According to Instagram, my high school group of friends is getting together without me. It’s fine. I didn’t keep in touch. I don’t know how to explain my job or college major to the people who live in this town, and with new piercings, a new hair color, and many pounds lost, I’m not sure they’d recognize me anyway. There’s nothing left for me here. When I’m sitting on my couch feeling bummed about it all, I pull out this bag. My Lay-N-Go contains multitudes: my Bose noise-cancelling headphones, an iPad, a charger, a smart watch, a couple apps, an e-book or two, and the afternoon is my own. Not New York’s, and not Lakeville’s — mine. It’s a piece of the city I’ve brought with me to this tiny village in the hills. A taste of things that are expensive, busy, and made for one person alone. “Just flip the bird,” a friend once told me. Flip the bird at them all. Hormonal IUD I will never forget my male gynecologist’s face as he inserted this thing into my body. “Ah, the things women have to go through,” he mused, chuckling to himself, as I squirmed, biting my tongue to keep from screaming, watching myself bleed. If you’re inclined to make quips like this, perhaps consider a career other than a gynecologist. The following is not an exaggeration: Every time I mention to someone that i have an IUD, they tell me they know someone who knows someone who almost died or is now infertile because of a complication with their own IUD. Honestly, just stop. Stop telling me about these people. I don’t need you all spooking me about what science conclusively says is probably a safe procedure if you do all the proper things. Just go. Shoo. Anyway, no babies yet. Amazon Echo Show I did a real review of this thing, so I won’t get too into the weeds here. I fell in love a couple times this year. My first love brought a woman home when I was out of town, fed her my drugs, and kissed her on our couch. I was in Seattle when I found out, and I cried for ten minutes in a bathroom stall. Sometimes I scroll back through our messages, just to make myself feel something. I don’t want to forget what he did. My second love was the Echo Show. It has never once cheated on me, and also comes with Hulu, NBC, and two browsers built in. As it has no legs, I never have to worry about it packing it in and walking out while I’m out of town on weekends. It’s never going to convince me that something I was a victim of was my fault. And, best of all, it’s never going to lie. Right, Alexa? Don’t lie. Now play Mrs. Maisel. Please. TP-Link ADSL2 Modem I don’t care how much Spectrum throttles me (and I know it is) — my modem is my modem, and there’s nothing you all can do about it. After moving into my current apartment, I cried almost all night. Everything around me felt alien, and I was viscerally aware that I’d left a life behind. I would have watched Netflix to distract myself, but the modem that Spectrum had given me wasn’t working. The next morning, I bought one of three modems that I found in the back corner of Best Buy’s basement, covered in plastic and dust. I watched Netflix the rest of that day, and I haven’t cried since. Rubik’s Cube At one point this year, I was working a job where my boss thought I was bad. It happens. But it was my first job out of college (save a summer internship) and it hurt. Multiple times, I left crying. I began the job thinking I wanted to be a journalist, and ended it thinking I wasn’t worthy of flipping burgers. I’m the only person I know who can solve a Rubik’s cube. It was hard at first, but I figured out the algorithms, the way the pieces work together. I hate myself for it, but I smile when I watch others struggle. I finally bought myself one of these as a reminder — you are a thinker. “Do not let one idiot stop you from achieving greatness,” a friend texted me after I left a meeting crying. My boss had, in sugarcoated terms, told me I wasn’t very smart. At the time, and throughout the job, I reminded myself that I could be great, that I shouldn’t listen to the haters — all the things they say on motivational posters. But after a year of reflection, what I saw as an injustice I see now as a necessary douse of cold water. My boss wasn’t the main obstacle I needed to overcome: My ego was. I wasn’t good enough. I won’t be until I’ve proven myself — and I didn’t do that this year. So I’ve put the Rubik’s Cube away. I need to work on other things. Raymor and Flanigan Lamp Chrome Floor Lamp There is a man who does not love me, who I am not sure I will ever stop loving. I have loved him for years. I bought this lamp because its title sounded similar to his name. That’s all I’m going to say, because it’s very possible he’s reading this, and I don’t want to ruin our friendship which is, outside of the feelings-y weirdness, very nice. Then again, isn’t that all friendships? Dude, I’m glad I met you, but I’m sad that I still love you. Please get bad plastic surgery, or go work at Burger King or something, so that I can return this lamp. At the moment, it’s still in the corner of my living room, so I’m still thinking about you. Audible Subscription Everyone says you need to read to be a good writer. I don’t doubt this. But I never liked reading, for whatever reason. The internet pulled me away from it in early high school, and I never went back. I’ve tried to read a number of different books, but nothing sticks. It’s just not fun for me. I bought this Audible subscription at the beginning of 2018, hoping it would help me learn to love books. But so far, I’ve found audiobooks even easier to put down than books are. My brain just tunes them out when it’s bored. When I tune back in, I’ve lost the plot of the story, so I’m bored again, and the cycle repeats. I don’t doubt that my writing suffers because I rarely read. Please let me know if you have suggestions, because Audible didn’t help. Prose Shampoo I get why you’re all upset with Facebook’s collecting and selling of our data. I’ll admit that it makes me uneasy at times. But here’s a silver lining: In early September, I complained to a friend (via Facebook Messenger) that I couldn’t, for the life of me, find an affordable shampoo that I liked. A few hours later, an ad for Frose appeared on my timeline. I punched in my info and ordered it. It’s perfect. My hair feels like satin after I’ve used it. Where has this shampoo been all my life? Thank you, Mark and Sheryl. Off-World Trading Company I bought this game to play with a man I’ve been in love with for too long. The game is everything I see him as: beautiful, tongue-in-cheek, fiercely analytical. The narrator’s voice reminds me a bit of his. But I suppose the closest thing I have to a new-year’s resolution is to stop being hung up on those who don’t love me back: lovers, friends, family, and all. I guess the first step to that is getting rid of this game. -- -- trying my best.

Taking back the control,Written by Siddarth Kengadaran," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Siddarth Kengadaran Follow Siddarth Kengadaran -- Listen Share Great technology should improve life, not distract from it. It was 11 years ago when I first got my mobile phone. Mobile phones have evolved in so many ways in this 11 years from monochrome graphics to 16M colored OLED touchscreen. As they have moved from a product of luxury to a product of necessity, it has changed the way we buy things, communicate with people, eat, work and also what we do, how we think, what we focus on and our habits because technology is evolving faster than we are! Mobile phones haven’t just impacted the lives of individuals but at large as a society. With the increase in problems such as social comparison, self-comparison, fear of missing out, smartphone zombie, decreased attention, shortness of temper, sleep disorders, depression etc., we can’t just stop using mobile phones but we can control how we use them rather than diving into the infinity pool. Few things which have worked for me and which can help you to gain back the control, 1) Uninstall all the applications which takes your time unnecessarily (infinity pool) instead use them on the computer when you have real necessity or on a mobile browser, atleast there is a resistance. 2) Disable lock screen notifications. 3) Disable notifications from apps which don’t need your immediate attention. 4) Set up wind down time for your sleep routine. 5) Don’t check your phone first thing in the morning. 6) Leave your phone in a different room or far from reach when you want to concentrate on a piece of work. 7) Monitor your app usage, both iOS (Screen Time) and Android (Digital Wellbeing) have dashboards to monitor your app usage. 8) Stop being reactive These are just a few tricks which have helped me which I am trying to master. If you have any other ideas or tricks do share! Let’s build a future where technology stands behind and life stands ahead Wishing you a very happy and focused new year 2019! -- -- Siddarth Kengadaran Product Consultant, Enabling teams to strategize and build with conscious intention.

Big guys getting bigger,In closing,Written by Andre Podnozov"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Andre Podnozov Follow Predict -- Listen Share LinkedIn approached me about expressing my views on what will be the Big Ideas of 2019, in a similar vein to their prediction piece. So I came up with my own list, except these are not predictions per se — after all, I’m no shaman and I can’t see the future. Instead, the ideas on this list — they are simply in the air and I’m only channeling them. Some of these ideas will materialize in 2019, whereas other ones are clearly long-term and they will play out over the course of years if not decades. With de-globalization picking up steam, deeper economies of scale are becoming increasingly unsustainable. This presents companies with a challenge and an opportunity at the same time. The challenge is that they have to bring additional portions of manufacturing chain in-house. On the other hand, it gives companies the opportunity to ensure excellent end-to-end user experience with their products. Of recent examples, Tesla has been masterful in using vertical integration to its advantage. But the big-picture benefit here is growing re-industrialization and diversity of domestic manufacturing capabilities, which will have very positive long-term effect on many aspects of life: from improved standard of living for the population as a whole, to strengthened geopolitical position of the country. In another consequence of fragmenting global markets, the pace of innovation is slowing down, especially in the R&D-intensive areas. Just see how much difficulty Intel is having with their 10nm products. Another example is advanced display technologies. Currently the buzz is hot around flexible displays: folding phones and roll-up TV screens. While technical feasibility of such products exists, their high prices will not likely be conducive to wide-spread market success, especially in the climate of decreasing consumer purchasing power, tied to projected economic downturn of 2019. I mean, how many flat-screen TVs does a reasonable person need in every room, including bathrooms? That’s not to say that advanced research should not be done, however it would have to be re-angled from near-term commercial profitability to more strategic goals. As the ancient wisdom says, nobody can enter the same river twice. By the same token, it’s not possible to carry out re-industrialization using last century technologies. In order for the economy to regain its industrial strength in the competitive landscape, we need a lot of breakthroughs in all areas of science. Unfortunately, core scientific fields are not as popular with American college students nowadays, compared to Business degrees for example. In fact, hard majors like Physics don’t even register in top-40 rankings, according to some studies. While the focus on STEM is gaining momentum, we still have ways to go before this society starts producing required amounts of scientific brainpower. How glorious will be the day when a PhD in Materials Science, for example, becomes more desirable than an MBA! It is high time for this country to set aside its disagreements and work together towards common goals. Some of these goals may be technological in nature, for example: spreading human civilization beyond planet Earth; while others may be focused on social progress, for example: eradicating poverty and hunger. Naturally, technology will be heavily involved in anything we do in this day and age, but that’s not the main point. Advanced modern technologies would allow this society to set such ambitious and worthy goals that the overwhelming majority of the population can get behind in full consciousness — this is the uniting factor. And these goals will actually be demonstrably achievable through the course of scientific progress, which will reinforce confidence in the initiatives. Could this be the foundation of the New American Dream? Because the old promise — that children live better than parents — does not hold true anymore. Just ask the millennials. There is a lot of opportunity in using technology to further social goals. For example, the society would benefit from increased sense of trust between all participants. Alas, all the cat and dog videos crowding the social network feeds don’t go quite far enough towards building that sense of community. I look forward to new generation of social technologies that are aimed at bringing out the best in people, rather than monetizing the hours they spend in front of the screen. I wrote a separate article on this, so I’ll just link to it rather than be repetitive: Basic Needs as a driver of the Next Industrial Revolution Ok, over-hyped technologies, you know who you are… yes I’m looking at you Blockchain. Well, if I were to be serious for a moment, commonly circulated decentralized money would have far-reaching consequences for our civilization because it would challenge the millennia-old status quo. And that’s exactly why this would never be allowed to happen — not until a major climate disruption in hell, I would think. In the meantime, the exaggerated amount of attention devoted to over-hyped technologies is distracting and counter-productive. It would be best to focus our collective energies on higher-priority goals. Big players tend to weather the trying times better than smaller companies. In the end of the day this allows the big guys to get even bigger — that’s the “last-man-standing” reward of sorts. Let’s take a specific example — cloud providers. At this point I think it’s safe to say that we will not have more than 3 cloud providers in the US anymore. We may even see this number starting to get reduced to 2. Challenges and opportunities always go hand-in-hand, so let us enter 2019 with optimism and the best New Year wishes all-around! What are the great things you are looking forward to in 2019?

Instagram TV: The Product I Most Recently Used That Took My Breath Away,"About the Author: Who am I?,Written by Rashaud Savage,Introduction,How IGTV Works,My Takeaway"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Rashaud Savage Follow -- Listen Share ** Note: As apart of KPCB’s Product Fellows Program application, I have been asked to describe “the last product you used that took [my] breath away.” ** In recent years, Instagram has grown considerably from an app that shares photos amongst friends into a social network where users can interact with friends and many different forms of media. A significant change that has happened recently is the introduction of Instagram TV (IGTV). IGTV was created as a long-form (less than an hour) video hub for videos longer than the 1- minute videos you may encounter in you normal instagram feed. It is also distinguished differently from the 10 second videos located in Instagram stories. IGTV is accessible from a button inside the Instagram home screen, as well as a standalone app, IGTV will spotlight popular videos from Instagram celebrities and creators. IGTV enables anyone to be a creator, not just big-name celebrities. People can upload vertical videos through Instagram’s app or the web. Everyone except smaller and new accounts can upload hour-long videos immediately. The IGTV app is available globally on iOS and Android, as well as in the Instagram app through a TV shaped button above Stories. Viewers are able to swipe through a variety of longer-form videos, or swipe up to visit a browse tab of personally recommended videos, popular videos, creators they’re following and the option to continue watching previously started videos. Users also get callouts from the IGTV button alerting them to new content. IGTV lets creators develop Instagram Channels full of their different videos that people can subscribe to. Creators are also able to put links in the description of their videos to drive traffic to their other social presences, e-commerce stores or websites. Below is an 1 minute demo of IGTV. Instagram has created an opportunity to settle into a sweet spot between YouTube and Snapchat Discover. YouTube offers an incredible breadth of content, but it’s so packed with amateurish videos that it can be tough to find the gems. With algorithmic, personalized curation and a narrower set of sources, Instagram could raise the likelihood that users will like what they’re shown. That could encourage users to fill a 7- 10 minute Uber ride or 30-minute commute with Instagram’s long-form video platform rather than aimlessly wandering the web. On the other end of the spectrum, Snapchat has focused on heavy-handed curation for Discover, only working with chosen partners. But that means it can be tough to find something to watch that really resonates. The recent redesign drowns polished Discover video in rivers of friends’ Stories and semi-pro creators. And Snapchat has just 186 million daily users compared to the 500 million-plus Instagram has. That reach could lure in creators who want to build their brand and audience, as well as (although not finalized how) earn money from their content. I suggest that it take the form of pre-roll ads or mid-break commercials, with creators potentially earning a revenue share. This is all what Facebook was hoping to do with Facebook Watch, but that original video hub was filled with third-rate reality shows and documentaries that haven’t piqued the interest of the younger crowd. Facebook is a ubiquitous utility, but it’s certainly not cool any more (according to todays youth). It’s NBC. Here, Instagram has a chance to be the second coming of MTV but for the newer generation. As someone who aspires to be a product manager one day, I would love to meet with the team and the product manager behind IGTV. I strongly believe that IGTV is a success because it lives at the intersection of technology, creativity, and business. Rashaud Savage of course! Currently Residing in Atlanta, I am now a senior working toward a Master of Science in Computer Science degree at Georgia Institute of Technology. For fun, I code Android and IOS apps and have many ideas for startups. For work, I have aspirations of being a product manager. I would love the opportunity to be a part of the KPCB Product Fellows Program! To join a community, that spans beyond companies, schools, disciplines, locations and traditional networks. Who put themselves in the shoes of others and do their best to gain perspective and create mutual respect. I look forward to the opportunity to make lifelong friends who grow and learn together.

How to maximize the usage of your mobile data?,Written by Cindy Chuah," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Cindy Chuah Follow -- Listen Share Thrashing your mobile data every month? Good news to every mobile subscriber who has excess mobile data out there! Now, you have a choice! An international award winning start-up, Simplify, has launched a mobile app to let you sell your unutilized monthly mobile data bandwidth for cash. In its mission to make Internet more affordable and accessible, Simplify aims to rechannel unused Internet bandwidth for the needy. Remember, there are still 4 Billion people on the planet without Internet access. The company first launched its service in late 2016 and since be crowned two major accolades which includes being named as one of the Most Innovative Companies and Most Disruptive Business on the planet. Its notable use cases cover Grab drivers selling to passengers as an extra income, tour guides selling to foreign tourists who didn’t purchase a local SIM card or refused to turn on the expensive data roaming. Interestingly, Simplify tends to create a new sharing economy in the mobile broadband space to benefit 3 major segments of mobile users: 1) Unlimited data plan; 2) Mid-tier data plan with huge data quota; 3) Prepaid plan with very limited quota. If you fall under the first two categories, Simplify has the right solution for you to sell off your unused data bandwidth to subsidize your own mobile data plan! This app has created a win-win solution to the consumers: You sell your unused mobile data for cash, and buyers get to buy your data on a pay-as-you-go basis. Sellers can fix the rate they wish to sell, for example RM8/GB. Like Grab and AirBnB, Simplify will take 20% commission out of the total data revenue sold (p/s: the company needs it to maintain their server). No contract, no hidden cost, all you need is to sign up a PayPal account to start selling your unutilized bandwidth. All transactions are cashless. On top of that, connecting on Simplify is convenient as buyers are not required to key in any Wi-Fi password in order to access the Internet, as Simplify will connect you smartly on the fly. All you have to do is just to choose which connection has the strongest network strength, click it, and there you go! You’re connected. Fret not on the security of this app, because you are in safe hands of Simplify as the app double-encrypt your hotspot password in the phone, and it does not forward or store your Wi-Fi password on the cloud. Simplify takes security and privacy of their users as first priority. Smart, Seamless and Secure, as its name suggests, Simplify caters for convenience and security. Have you Simplify?

ABOUT SIMPLIFY Simplify, one of the World’s 50 Most Innovative Companies, creates a marketplace for users to buy and sell excess mobile data from their monthly plans, extending sharing economy to the mobile broadband space. Simplify enables sellers to set their data prices at a single touch and the service dynamically creates an encrypted hotspot password so buyers can seamlessly piggyback on another person’s internet access on the fly. Headquartered in Malaysia, Simplify idea was validated and refined at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The technology that powered Simplify has since granted a US Patent.

Haley Kirk_Design Thinking Exercise,Written by Haley Kirk," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Haley Kirk Follow -- 1 Listen Share Whole Bank is transitioning from a conventional bank to a bank that puts tech and customer service at the center of its focus. In an ever more globalized economy, being able to give customers global solutions is no longer an option, it is a requisite. Whole Bank would like to take away the stress and lack of clarity that often comes with paying for things internationally. Whole Bank looks to do this while maintaining their high standards of personalized customer service. Our interviewees ranged from young professionals traveling on business and pleasure to retirees traveling for cultural experiences and family visits. Although their motives for travel and their spending habits varied, we found 5 similar topics arise in most interviews. Most interviewees indicated that their biggest concern was avoiding extra fees and bad conversion rates while traveling. We decided to focus on this issue while creating an app design for Whole Bank. We came up with several solutions to avoid extra fees and commissions. We focused on 2 specifically: We created a process that quickly educates the consumer about the country’s conversion rate through a visual aid. From there, the consumer is brought to their digital wallet where they can see their various card providers at a glance. This was an important solution we thought we could easily incorporate as many consumers said card acceptance was an issue. We wanted consumers to easily be able to tell if their card was Visa, AMEX, Mastercard, etc. While in their wallet, the client can slide out a card to see the full card details or to make a payment. Each card will show details regarding fees, points, and conversion rates. Almost all interviewees indicated that they found it necessary to carry at least some cash on hand. For this reason we also included an ATM finder option. The ATM finder would work with Google Maps and show pins in green, yellow, or red depending on the ATM’s fees and conversion rate. One important comment from an interviewee was, “I like the personal attention I receive from my bank.” We wanted to ensure that consumers felt taken care of, even while using a mobile app. We tried to convey this sentiment through the tone of the copy and through the inclusion of a live chat that connects consumers to a bank representative. I found this challenge fun and also eye-opening. There were several key points I took away from the experience. 1. The prototyping process is much more involved than I expected! Realistically, my prototype needed to include many more screens. There were certain features that I did not draw out a screen for. For example, the button that indicated “€ -› $” would have “flipped” to show the digital wallet in the user’s home currency. 2. There are certain features that I don’t know how to communicate through a prototype sketch. I had many features that in my mind seemed intuitive but I wasn’t really sure how to communicate them on a sketch. For example, I wanted a haptic response when a user has selected and is sliding out a credit card in the digital wallet. How can I communicate that in a sketch? Similarly, there were certain screens I wanted to fade in and out. I didn’t know how to convey that through a sketch. 3. When is it necessary to explicitly put something in writing for the consumer and when is it visually more pleasing to leave it up to intuition? For example, I first considered not including the button that indicated “€ -› $”. I thought I would just have the consumer click their amount total in their account and have the screen “flip” to the other currency. However, I wasn’t sure if this would be intuitive for most users, so I included a separate button. After showing the prototype sketch to one of the participants, she commented, “There are too many screens before I get to my wallet. I want to be able to just log in and go.” I wasn’t sure if this was just one consumer’s opinion or if I needed to pare down the instructions at the beginning. All in all I found the process gratifying. When I “finished” the prototyping I wanted to continue developing different ideas. I look forward to tackling more projects! -- -- 1 The Journey of a UX/UI Designer: People-focused, fiercely fun.

The Role of Social Media in Election 2016,Written by Ed Newman," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Ed Newman Follow -- Share What really happened? And what next? Here are some clues. This past month I read and wrote about the book LikeWar: The Weaponization of Social Media by P.W. Singer & Emerson T. Brooking. I found the book so eye-opening I felt compelled to ask for it for Christmas. The authors address a whole range of subjects related to the new media, but devote special attention to the 2016 election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. The degree to which social media has been in play in our elections is mind-boggling, and only now seems to have become apparent. It’s not like the 2016 election was the first to utilize social media influence. Obama was adept to a certain degree with the emerging possibilities of social media, as this Atlantic article notes. But that was all warm-up compared to election 2016. Very early on Hillary’s army took to the trenches, making moves to gain an advantage. According to Nick Allen’s article in The Telegraph, “Mrs Clinton employed more than 100 people in her digital team and spent tens of millions of dollars targeting millennials with a series of hi-tech messages on Facebook.” -- -- An avid reader who writes about arts, culture, literature & other life obsessions. @ennyman3 Look for my books on Amazon https://tinyurl.com/y3l9sfpj Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*iO1iqVuK2MbHbZ0z-bd0fQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*igl56Qp6weBrv9Eqi2s3wA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:410/0*x0CUzM3VgIk3AHTk.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*iO1iqVuK2MbHbZ0z-bd0fQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*twJ55FnZ4o5HOFWwD8-UHQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*iO1iqVuK2MbHbZ0z-bd0fQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*_ChoU3lntcOpreA4sE3v1A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*iO1iqVuK2MbHbZ0z-bd0fQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*FuJhdMd4ytROQviZDgks4A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*iO1iqVuK2MbHbZ0z-bd0fQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*t8Q6VEDGctfSlsamTKQ_bg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*iO1iqVuK2MbHbZ0z-bd0fQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*_eYHSSUS0abUxmDU', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*wXgeNtz5OJ5O9T3c3mQRRw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/0*tIipcmrInD5UMpQI.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/0*3OsUtsnlTx9Svm4c.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*IPZF1hcDWwpPqOz2vL7NxQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*0fHUKyg3xtpNWpop35PR4g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/0*r4yjMpEmqzHCUvWC.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*bv2KUVNLi2sFNjBTdoBmWw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/0*zsngbTOmFCy6sUCx.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*swd_PY6vTCyPnsgBYoFZfA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*8sSAHftNwd_RNJ3k4VA0pA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*uNyD4yNMH-DnOel1wzxOOA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*niQ0sAwUszuyNMyH.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*pZPMtIONqtJYi2xHYD_Ivg.jpeg']",1-Jan-19,https://medium.com/?source=post_page-----46666d28c063--------------------------------,121,4 min read

Lambda School: Extending the Frontier of Online Schooling,Written by QBR Editor-in-Chief," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in QBR Editor-in-Chief Follow -- Listen Share January 1st, 2019 By: Julia Sun A Software Engineering Manager was deemed by LinkedIn to be the 2nd most promising job of 2018, having a year over year growth of 38% and a Career Advancement score of 8/10. In today’s business environment, the demand for “tech skills” is only increasing with technology playing a pivotal role in core business operations. Employers are intensifying their search for tech-enthusiasts who have built up the skills to be able to thrive in this ever-changing industry. It isn’t just the technology industry that is driving demand for those with tech skills; it is becoming a prominent trend across industries. In sales, big data analysis can produce higher quality lead generation and increased revenue. In marketing, candidates with knowledge of SEO, HTML, and CSS are more likely to stand out from the crowd. Even in the Finance industry those with knowledge of Python are more highly valued by recruiters. Experience with AI, data science talent, cybersecurity, mobile application development, programming knowledge, and coding and engineering experience are just some of the top tech skills that have been referenced by Forbes to be in high demand for 2018. Lambda School is one online schooling platform that recognizes the demand for tech skills and is striving to be at the forefront of the investment in tech skills for future generations with its innovative pedological model. Lambda School is a 30-week program that trains people to be software engineers. The school offers two academies — Computer Science and Data Science — along with two mini boot camps for Web Development and Machine Learning, all of which are entirely online and live. The live lectures are designed to be in small, interactive groups to make learning more engaging. Students can complete the full course in 30 weeks, with a forty-hour time commitment per week, and the Computer Science Academy offers the ability to become a part-time student and complete it in 12 months, with a 3-hour daily commitment for 4 days of the week. The school has also set up Slack, the common team collaboration tool, to make communication easier. By logging onto the platform, students can directly communicate with professors and TAs and that way, help is provided instantaneously during school hours. This complements the live lectures incredibly well and allows students to avoid the response lag that email brings. The key differentiator for Lambda school that sets it apart from the other schools in the realm of online learning? Students pay nothing up-front. Instead, once they secure a job and earn at least $50,000 per year, they pay back 17% of their annual income for the first two years, with total tuition being capped at $30,000. If for some reason, a student is unable to find a job with a salary above the set threshold, they are not required to pay anything. Students can also opt to pay a tuition of $20,000 up-front with no later income-based repayment. Lambda School is clever with this business model. They recognize that with the rise of AI and the increased presence of technology in many aspects, the job market for software engineering and data science is on the rise, fast. Companies are hungry for driven, knowledgeable, and skilled workers who have experience with back-end development, coding, and handling data and these companies are looking to hire good talent. When looking at job outlooks, according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics, Software Developers have an estimated 24% growth from 2016 to 2026, which is a much faster growth rate compared to the average of around an 8% growth rate. The drop-out rate for the school is roughly 10%, which is relatively impressive considering the intense personal commitment demanded by the curriculum. Through an application process, Lambda School allows itself to be selective about the students it accepts into the program, and it has found that the key to a good student is found in their drive. The students who are consistently out-performing their peers are the hard workers who demonstrate this trait from the beginning. A look at their financial payback set-up also proves the company has clearly thought of all its potential pitfalls. 17% of 50,000, the required minimum level of annual income, is $8500 per year. The typical entry-level software engineer salary has a median pay of $64,787 CDN. In more senior positions, the Bureau of Labour Statistics even reported a median pay in 2016 of $102,280. 17% of the median pay for an entry-level position is $10,996.80. It is typically difficult for an entry-level position to pay less than a $50,000 salary, which allows the school to mitigate the risk of a student not being able to pay tuition. To mitigate this tuition-default risk even further, Lambda School has established a strong employer partners network. They have over 75 industry partners who offer the school and its student’s ongoing support, as well as hiring newly-minted developers right when they’re finished the rigorous curriculum. These partners are actively looking to hire Lambda’s students specifically, and as industry partners, they’re able to give the school feedback on the curriculum and work with them on developing and changing it. This set-up means that students have a better chance of securing a reputable job following completion of the program, the companies are hiring quality talent who went through a curriculum that they approved of, and Lambda School is receiving their desired income-based compensation. It’s a win-win-win. Recently, an Apprenticeship Program was also launched. Companies commit to creating a 3 to 6 month long paid internship with the potential for a full-time hire at the end, and the school works on finding the perfect candidate for them. Both the ongoing expansion of the partners’ network and this Apprenticeship Program is a strategic move for Lambda as it plays well into the well-known knowledge of the cost of a bad hire, and the risk and anxiety that often surrounds companies when finding new, quality talent. According to the Society for Human Resource Management, the cost of a bad hire is 5 times the bad hire’s annual salary. These costs not only include the costs of re-hiring and replacing the employee, but also the effect it can have on the organization, its culture, and productivity and performance as a whole. Companies, especially in a field that is as fast-paced and innovative as computing and technology, want the A-listers of the technology realm. They cannot afford to keep around second tiered individuals who drive away the superstars and influence the organizational culture. Lambda strives to deliver these A-team programmers, who were primed with 30 weeks of intense learning and training, right to the company’s front doors. Above all, what truly makes Lambda shine is its mission of “investing in human potential”. Their desire is to aide ambitious individuals in their pursuit of building a new skill set, and they set a good example of what more organizations should be investing in. Lambda’s goal, at its core, is to grant access to higher education for those who may be getting left behind for different social reasons. According to a study done by the National Association of Student Financial Aid and Administrators, low-income students cannot afford 95 percent of colleges in the United States. It is a bit of a play into the division between the ‘haves’ and the ‘have-nots’, but their aspirations to invest in the ‘have-nots’ to help them achieve higher paying jobs is admirable. Beyond solely financial reasons, Lambda is certainly very cognizant of the additional fear that many students carry with them when beginning to walk down a new path. A lot of people in Silicon Valley underestimate how big of a risk it is to go to school for four years, take out potentially crippling student loans, and hope that it all works out on the other side. Especially if an individual doesn’t know if technology engineering is the path for them, it can be a big risk with a huge opportunity cost to go to school, spend so much time building a skill set, and then end up switching careers or programs. As Lambda so accurately phrases it, with their business model, it is school investing in the students, instead of the other way around. And this is truly what the mission of many educational institutions should be.

Microsoft + GitHub,Written by Mayank Kishore," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Mayank Kishore Follow Buzzwords -- Listen Share (original post date, 7/30/2018) 7.5 billion dollars. That’s the price at which Microsoft bought GitHub this past month. Why? Sure, GitHub is a platform accessed daily by thousands of coders, but what made it valuable enough for Microsoft to value it at 7.5 billion dollars? Was it to promote the use of Microsoft’s IDE, Visual Studio Code? Nope, as CEO Satya Nadella has assured us that there will be no major changes to GitHub’s infrastructure. Though no clear statement was made on GitHub’s use to Microsoft, it is clear that Microsoft is shifting its company ideologies in a new direction, emphasizing the importance of collaboration and open source. Instead, with GitHub’s 27 million+ software developers working on over 85 million repositories of code, it is quite apparent that Microsoft is focusing on serving software developers (whether those developers are coding for Windows or not). GitHub assures its users that this acquisition would have no impact on the platform they’ve come to love. Current CEO Chris Wanstrath said that “Their focus on developers lines up perfectly with our own, and their scale, tools and global cloud will play a huge role in making GitHub even more valuable for developers everywhere.” With Nat Friedman taking over GitHub as CEO and Wanstrath gearing up to join Microsoft’s board, Wanstrath’s faith in Microsoft is largely based on their ability to maintain a high level of autonomy and on the moves made by Microsoft’s current CEO over the past few years. In fact, let’s talk a little bit about the level-headed and forward-thinking vanguard of Microsoft: Satya Nadella. This deal shows the enormous changes that the current CEO has put in place since he took charge. Only a couple of years ago, Microsoft was taking yearly losses as it struggled to compete with the giants of Google and Apple. By ditching the Windows Phone, Microsoft has been able to focus on improving different aspects of its business model. With its emphasis on computing, Microsoft has taken leaps which show in their increased profits and (finally) some significant positive quarterly earnings. Nadella’s move to acquire LinkedIn in 2016 was no rushed decision either. A 26 billion dollar acquisition, Satya Nadella was turning the company around from Steve Ballmer’s costly mistake with Nokia, where Microsoft tried to capture the mobile market by pushing the Windows Phone. Nadella is committed to shaping the image of Microsoft from one of a closed community to one of open inclusion. His accomplishment with shifting Microsoft’s public image cannot be understated and, with his latest move, it seems that Nadella is making all of the right moves, opening his arms to open source software. But how will Nadella integrate Microsoft’s environment with GitHub? GitHub hosts over 27 million developers who depend on using GitHub’s services daily. Since these developers serve as the key market for Microsoft’s developer tools, Microsoft will be able to push its technologies to a larger market. Their goal is to be able to empower developers at “every step of the development lifecycle.” Their biggest plans come with the GitHub marketplace where Microsoft intends to utilize the marketplace in order to push all of Microsoft’s tools and services to make it available to everyone in the developer community. Finally, Microsoft is dedicated to seamlessly integrating Visual Studio Code’s environment directly into GitHub so developers can collaborate with less effort and boost overall productivity. The last bit of interesting news comes from Diane Greene, head of Google’s cloud, who mentioned, “I wouldn’t have minded buying them.” Google has two of GitHub’s largest projects, TensorFlow and Kubernetes, and are GitHub’s biggest contributor. Greene suggested that Microsoft’s bid may have been too high to prompt Google to throw its hat into the ring. She leaves off with the hope the Microsoft will keep GitHub neutral because GitHub was founded on the basis of open source. Finally, Satya Nadella’s explains the merger: “Computing is becoming embedded in the world, with every part of our daily life and work and every aspect of our society and economy being transformed by digital technology. Developers are the builders of this new era, writing the world’s code. And GitHub is their home.” Albeit polished, his words continue to reflect Microsoft’s bright future. The deal will close later this year, with the payment being completed in stocks.

But features such as GPRS, instant messaging and, most remarkably, intangible aspect “mobility”, revolutionised the industry and now we can’t think of a world without our devices. Such is the case with blockchain, and it’s not a great working alternative to the present solution. It’s hard to understand, difficult to code, difficult to implement and has a low adoption. But the intangible aspect that blockchain brings to the table is “trust” that is not centralised under a single authority. Now we can create money, documents, bills and many more things from anywhere for everywhere. But, it is going to take a few years before blockchain becomes a household concept. How is blockchain going to become a household concept? A 5-year-old doesn’t care about the inner workings of a mobile nor of blockchain. They only want to play angry birds. Similarly, a working professional doesn’t care much about the inner workings of a food and grocery delivery app, they are concerned about food being delivered at their doorstep. Mass adoption comes from distribution that does not disrupt the daily working of a consumer. To build distribution you need various catalysts at different stages. Bitcoin was for the early blockchain adopters, nerds who wanted to explain to 5 yr olds what blockchain is. Now comes the turn of the early and late majority for mass adoption. We need to wait and watch to see what will catalyse mass majority. Sectors and projects that will move the needle in the blockchain space in 2019 will be the financial, insurance and retail industry and projects such as Filecoin, Protocol Labs, Origin, and PROPS have the possibility to become mainstream options to the present alternatives.

"Our Kids Got Smartphones — Why I’m Okay With This, Seeing The Potential, Not Just Disasters",Written by Jon Lightle," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Jon Lightle Follow -- Listen Share We gave our kids their own phones recently. They are 7 and 9. Some parents may say it’s the norm these days, some may say my wife and I are bad parents by encouraging entitilement and so on. I disagree, with this highly, if we look this problem from all angles and help navigate our children through responsible use of mobile technology. After all, how can we say chidlren aren’t old enough, even when adults have bad phone habits themselves. (Myself included.) Working from home and learning from home (that’s what I call homeschool), my kids throughout the day may find me texting mom, checking email, making a post, sharing a story on instagram, researching, and so on. They see me use my phone for so many things, they don’t see how much has changed in a decade since these devices have taken over uni-tasking technology. It’s not their fault, look around anywhere in a modernized environment and observe how many adults have their heads hunched down flipping their thumbs up and down on the over the tiny smooth screen. If I was a kid in this era I’d be absorbed too, pondering what do adults do with these things. Actually, tablets and such are nothing new to my kids. They’ve been exposed to an iPad and old iPod touch that weren’t being used since I’ve been able to get a iPhone 4s. During that time my kids were interested in playing games and now they’ve become curious about how to make videos, taking pictures with legos, and how to make apps. Last year, we sold the iPad, the iPod touch was long gone, and were just left with our phones. The kids were okay with this as they trying to save money for a Minecraft Edition Xbox One. I allowed them to borrow my phone to use so they could watch Minecraft tutorials, videos for schoolwork, crafts and reviews for toys. Not long after they wanted to learn to make their own videos just like these. This was ok for awhile, however there were times I had needed to get a call made, a text out, a text back, an email out, a post made, spend time engaging, and in all honesty I was becoming frustrated. And that’s when my wife and I considered the idea of our kids having the responsibility of a phone. Sure, they could just have an iPad to do this, but this came down to cost for us. Yesteryears iPhones are much cheaper than they were before and my kids didn’t have to have latest and greatest. Just something small enough to take with them, snap pictures, record video and contact us if there was an emergency. In a sense, having their own phone was no different from having an iPad, just now they would use cellular data. What’s more is with recent updates on time limits for screen time and more security for kids I was really warming up to the possibility. I also knew at some point they would have to learn about saftey online and I couldn’t shield them from everything. There was one surprising idea that really opened the door for me on this issue. The internet of today has shifted social media and mobile engagement. For some time now businesses are utilizing Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. It’s not just big businesses, it’s little shops in towns, the auto repair shop and the bakery just blocks away. They’re using the live features, posting news, specials and engaging with customers on social media. As an example, a small local baby shop selling cloth diapers, natural baby soaps and toys is posting to stories and live video showcasing products and answering questions from customers viewing the feed. My point to this, is that my kids are seeing this, they’re seeing me do it too, as a freelance illustrator I have to engage in this social world as this is where the world is today. I don’t know what the future entirely holds for jobs and so on but I’d have to say this is a great time for them to learn where things are today. My kids are interested in making videos, they want to share their ideas, wild as they maybe to the world. They don’t know what they want to be when they grow up yet, but they’re willing to figure it out along the way. I know there is some backlash on letting kids have phones and using social media but what if it helped them solve problems going on in the world, what if it helped them take their ideas and make impact on someones life. Whether you agree or not, I feel like our children deserve to know the truth of where the worlds attention is, learn about issues going, and being an active part of this period of time. Yes I agree, there are lots of bad things in the digital world, but there is also lots of bad things in the real world. By holding our kids back, we could be losing kids who want to make the world a better place in the future. With some guidance and effort, we can can help our children see mobile technology as a tool for change, instead of our perception as these devices as a fun toy. -- -- Freelance illustrator who lives with a human wife and small humans and a dog.

Curation as Art,Written by Connor Miller," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Connor Miller Follow -- Listen Share The purpose of a librarian is to help the reader navigate overwhelm. The library is a huge place, that collects information that is organized by a set of rules. The librarian, familiar with the rules, listens to the reader and guides them to the appropriate section, author, or title. On the internet, we are faced with one of the largest libraries in the world. Similar to the moving staircases in Harry Potter, the rules change, the platforms change, and it can be difficult to find real news, useful information, or good content. Because the internet is vast and hard to navigate, I find we need guides, similar to librarians, who can take us to the places that contain the information that we need. The first librarian is our search engine (most likely Google). However Google is influenced by paid advertisements, and our results can be determined by what people want to sell us rather than what we actually want to read. This is why I have come back to a more humanistic approach to getting recommendations, since people tend to curate every day and can guide us (like librarians) to the real and true information. The second librarian, then, is our community. Every day I am on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, scrolling through a sea of content, liking, following, and unfollowing as I see fit. This is a form of curation that allows me to tailor my feed to my tastes. You do this, your friends to this, and anyone online does a version of this, making us all curators. We weed out what we don’t want to see and maximize what we do want. The result is a unique assortment of content that falls in line with what we want. Each person has specific taste, which makes each collection of online content singular and special. For example, I have a friend named Oscar who subscribes to an assortment of meme pages on Facebook, which he then shares through his own Facebook page. He shares the ones that he likes, and thus establishes a tone through his shared content. I enjoy the memes that Oscar shares, and even though he is not producing original content, the stream itself feels like original content. It is a little like making a music mashup. The final result is a piece of art build from the art of others. It reminds me of collages, or a scrapbook collection. Oscar’s product is his taste, which I support and subscribe to. In an effort to understand other people’s tastes and tendencies towards curation, I started a project called “CultureBucket”, in which I ask my friends every year to make a “Best of” list of media they consumed. This way I get a sense of what my friends are interested and the themes they follow in their own curation. I post these lists on a blog which you can read here. There are other folks as well who have really leaned in to the curation game. My favorite is Maria Popova, creator of Brainpickings (link). Self-described as a “curator of interestingness”, Popova reads a massive amount of books weekly, and shares excerpts of her favorites online. Many of the books she picks can be found at your local library. She will sometimes review bestsellers, but she also manages to bring in older books and authors that have insight that is still relevant today. On the topics of love, creativity, and living well, I find myself constantly coming back to Brainpickings for Popova’s exceptional taste. So, by taking note of how both Oscar and Popova manage to drive interest simply through sharing their collections, I think that we all can become conscious curators. Futhermore, I think knowing that curation is an art can help us find good accounts to follow as well. I find Joi Ito to be my favorite online curator. He has a podcast series in which he interviews his friends and colleagues in a informal manner, discussing extremely relevant and technical problems that we face today. Most recently I find myself re-listening to his conversation with Virginia Heffernan (link) in which they talk about how language and the internet influence each other. These conversations often serve as leads for other topics I am interested in. I am currently reading two books, each written by different folks Joi Ito has interviewed.

metadata management,Written by Janhavie," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Janhavie Follow Datacrat -- Listen Share According to a report published by IDC “Metadata is one of the fastest-growing sub-segments of enterprise data management.” Metadata is central component to the success of many of data management practices such as Data Governance, Master Data Management, Business Intelligence and Analytics, and other related activities in a data-driven enterprise. Data-driven enterprises are using data to generate new competitive advantage by systematically observing and analysing data. The role of metadata has become more pivotal than ever before. What is Metadata ? The most cliched and the simplest definition of metadata so far has been “Data about data”. With growing importance of data as strategic asset and trend of Data Driven Decision Making(DDDM) the definition have acquired a whole new meaning to it. The new-age definition by Gartner — Metadata is information regarding the characteristics of any artifact, such as its name, location, perceived importance, quality or value to the enterprise, and its relationships to other artifacts that an enterprise has deemed worth managing. Types of Metadata — Mostly metadata is categorised under 3 types - I much prefer the Business Intelligence broad categorisation into 2 over the above mentioned 3 types - And data represents actual instances. A very basic and not so fancy example below - What Is Metadata Management ? Metadata helps in understanding the data and metadata management helps in use of that metadata. Metadata management encompasses all the activities associated with metadata around creation, storage and control. The goals of metadata management are Metadata Management is intricately interlaced with data governance. Data governance incorporates and supervises all metadata management aspects and capabilities. -- -- Datacrat A traveler of both time and space...to be where I want to be…find me another space in another time.

#16 Snap: Ephemeral Philosophy 👻,Written by ㅤㅤㅤZakaria," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in ㅤㅤㅤZakaria Follow -- Listen Share When Snapchat hit the scene in 2011 It had a completely opposite idea as to how the Internet should be approached and didn’t see the need for photos to be archived in galleries or to share public posts. Those things eventually made the internet feel more fun by reducing competition and were relevant as our lives changed. Gen Z don’t just speak English we speak photo — it sounds grammatically awkward but it’s true when you really think about it so snap set up a platform that encourage you to capture authentic moments as they were happening. It felt like a breath of fresh air there was no pressure to look good sound good in fact the less stage you could capture a moment the better this is. By having an ephemeral concept it fits more oragnically into our natural social behaviours and made the relationships we had with people feel deeper. Snapchat keeping the camera as the first thing you see assumes your role on their app as a creator first whereas Instagram and Facebook assume your first consumer. There are even tinier honourable nuances like the fact that when you and a friend are both in a chat room on snap a smiley face will appear to make you both aware that you’re both virtually present in the room the point of this was to encourage instant messaging to be more resembling to an actual conversation. A chatroom on snap - whatever was said will disappear again this is modelled off a natural human conversation our words don’t cling to the air after we speak in person or on the phone which sets a different standard to what will be said again it honors the factor of the present moment through technology. We knew how intimate of an environment Snap had created and didn’t want to disrupt that in the name of ads but this became tricky. Most of these brands became impatient while keeping their users happy which meant balancing scalable money with unscalable work. Snapchat enables internet behaviours that are intimate and ephemeral which deepen the bonds, Facebook enables internet behaviours that are public and permanent which fragments them and makes them unmanageable. This is why philosophically snapchat and Facebook are not competitors if we really pay attention you can see how they’re almost opposites. I’m excited to see how snapchat will be using the next year to position themselves even more as a direct-to-consumer camera company and not primarily an advertisement business. The fact that they’ve already innovated new internet behaviours that other companies have had to steal just to stay alive. This what interests me in following their journey it’s so important to think about when why and how these platforms we use every day were designed. As I mentioned they absolutely dictate our behaviour which then influences our society are we going to keep praising companies just because of how much market power they have or because they actually add some sort of value into our lives. What good is it to keep rooting for a company that just uses our inability to focus to profit when we could be rooting for ones that earn our respect instead. I’ve read countless link pieces and reports on how Facebook was so smart for acting fast on eating Snapchat and getting those precious daily active users instead of taking the fall. But it wasn’t Facebook being smart that made us switch from Snap to Instagram it was that we’ve tricked ourselves into thinking the quantity and permanent public display of these views, likes and followers are more important than the intimacy and privacy of our relationships. It was because Snapchat created a thing that was sensitive about the parts of life that can’t be measured but we and these brands got lazy and impatient we wanted things we could calculate in scale. Facebook didn’t win simply because they got more use out of this they won because we let them what the numbers really show are not how brilliant Facebook was for stealing the stories feature but how much we wanted to compete more than we wanted to connect you. -- -- Present 👁 Interested in digital behaviour and building products Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*YIuW96T6VTU6a13TRaSYSg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*XOteEKXkDqzai1RwFZvqEQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*YIuW96T6VTU6a13TRaSYSg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*nmkI5zGhlj9KHZo67KJD5A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*YIuW96T6VTU6a13TRaSYSg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*nqQpee3uH2UEtd1jC5HFPA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*YIuW96T6VTU6a13TRaSYSg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*ulhBh17370fOALhXBNMP9Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*YIuW96T6VTU6a13TRaSYSg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*LWiqzOm2zEHt9-4D94Uh5w.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*YIuW96T6VTU6a13TRaSYSg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*_eYHSSUS0abUxmDU', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*wXgeNtz5OJ5O9T3c3mQRRw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/0*tIipcmrInD5UMpQI.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/0*3OsUtsnlTx9Svm4c.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*IPZF1hcDWwpPqOz2vL7NxQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*0fHUKyg3xtpNWpop35PR4g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg']",1-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@zackaria01?source=post_page-----f2e7c6849fe3--------------------------------,0,3 min read

I like to ask the question, “what about our work and lives today will feel ridiculous ten plus years from now?” What about the future will feel obvious in retrospect? Future forecasts are not an investment thesis because innovations, no matter how exciting they are, won’t happen until the present is ready for them (and this is why the best investors are more insightful about the present than they are about the future). But if you’re a product leader, entrepreneur, or very early-stage investor, future thinking tunes your attention and instincts. It also helps you determine whether a team is attempting to defy a likely outcome or make it happen in a better way. This year I shared some early thoughts on Twitter and solicited other ideas, which I have incorporated and attributed across the 8 themes below. I have also tried to connect some of my work and investments to these themes, which has been an interesting exercise. Let’s jump in. This is a trend I have been following for sometime and recently wrote about. As modern interfaces like voice remove options, augmented reality overlays our physical world, and artificial intelligence gains our trust by transcending our own reasoning, defaults will rule our lives and interfaces will compete against one another. I’ve come to call them disruptive interfaces — “drastically simpler and more accessible interfaces that ultimately commoditize everything underneath.” Consider some of the implications as modern interfaces like voice and AR go mainstream: I continue to believe that autonomous transportation, at least within city limits, will ultimately become a public utility, much like the subways, running water, and electricity. As transportation data in cities becomes the ultimate asset for scheduling and managing autonomous vehicles, it is much more probable that cities will operate autonomous vehicles and restrict access to main roads than a world where tons of privately owned autonomous vehicles using independent data sets roam the public streets. This one goes without saying, but the surprising thing is just how long it has taken for everyday life to be improved through readily accessible technology. In ten years, what about today will we recall with disbelief? The stars are finally aligning for environmentally-sound products, customer preferences, and distribution. As it becomes clear that factory farms are prone to bacterial outbreaks and so many foods and cosmetics contain questionable chemicals, we will crave more “natural” ways of living in every respect. This will change what we buy, the food we eat, and unleash a ton of innovation in the form factor of consumer goods. The ultimate promise of personalized experiences from artificial intelligence has, thus far, been mostly limited to advertising and ad-supported product experiences. Sure, there are smattering of other applications in medicine and your Netflix queue, but I am surprised by how much of daily life is still generalized as opposed to personalized. Online stores still show us every category, restaurants give us menus despite our allergies and diets, and we still become enamored by mass brands. How might artificial intelligence transform our everyday life experiences that would make today’s way of living look utterly ridiculous? I think we’ll look back at the next 5–10 years as a “great awakening” of sorts for our understanding of our bodies, psychology, and decisions. We’ll realize how blind we were to ourselves, ignorant of caloric intake, nutrient absorption, chemical exposure, UV light exposure, and the list goes on. No doubt, the state of social networking has degraded into a small number of mass-adopted applications driven by vanity and FOMO. Under the hood, most social networking and media products that proliferate our lives are optimized to keep us growing our networks and scrolling mindlessly through never-ending updates. As a result, we’ve ended up with larger loosely connected networks that provide more noise than signal for what actually matters to us. But something is changing in our desires and tolerances. We’re starting to mock these platforms, limit our time with them, or all-together delete our accounts. Perhaps it is our natural biological response to a superficial stimuli that has started to deteriorate our collective happiness and productivity? I anticipate (and hope) that the social networks of the future focus more on the problems to solve as opposed to fighting for our attention. What factors will drive these new social products? Finally, for all the talk of the dangers of artificial intelligence, we tend to skip over the fact that identity theft is a raging problem, that data breaches happen every day, that we’re always trying to moderate the impact of tech in our lives, and that spam and scams have become an everyday reality. Artificial intelligence is our best chance at a step-function more peaceful existence. These future forecasting exercises are fun, if nothing more. They spark conversation and debate with people you can learn from, so bring it on.

Understanding TypeScript Basics,"Installing Typescript,Class & Interface,Constructors,Access Modifiers,Written by Cem Eygi,What is this Typescript?,Installation,Strong Typing,Object-Oriented Features"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Cem Eygi Follow codeburst -- Listen Share Javascript is a flexible programming language. People who are familiar with programming languages like Java, C++, may have difficulties in using Javascript. Those languages are object-oriented, unlike classic Javascript (ES5). However, Javascript has evolved a lot in the last years. We are now able to write object-oriented JS code, with ES6. (If you don’t know ES6, click here for more). But there is also another way with additional features: Typescript. NOTE: In order to understand Typescript, you need to have at least some basic knowledge of Javascript and Object-Oriented Programming. Typescript can be explained as a superset of Javascript. It means that every Javascript (also ES6 & newer versions) code is valid Typescript code, but Typescript comes with some additional features: In Typescript, we can define a variable’s type with the strong-typing feature like we define a variable in Java or C++. Additionally, we are able to write object-oriented code with Typescript. Another important point is that Angular uses Typescript. So if you want to learn Angular, it’s an advantage to know some Typescript first. Let’s see how to start using Typescript… Before we can use Typescript, we need to install it on our computer. We can install Typescript with NPM, so if you don’t have Node.js installed on your machine, you can download it from here. After the installation is completed, go to your terminal and type node -v to check the version: Now you can install Typescript with NPM. Again from your terminal, type the following command to install Typescript: This command will install Typescript globally so you can use it in any project. After the installation completed, you can verify it with tsc -v . Now you can start using Typescript. Create a new file from your code editor and the extension of the file must be .ts. NOTE: Typescript files have a .ts extension. Browsers don’t understand Typescript code, so later it needs to get translated to Javascript. This command creates a Javascript file automatically and translates your Typescript code JS. Let’s move on with the main features of Typescript. Different from JS, we can define the types of our variables as number, string, boolean, array, any and much more. Below you can see some examples of strong typing: Another important feature of TS is that we can write object-oriented code. For example, we can define classes and interfaces: We have created a Student class and later we can create instances with the new keyword: After assigning the Student( ) object, we don’t need to declare its type again. It will be done automatically by Typescript. In Object-Oriented Programming, we have an important method called constructor( ). Every class has actually a default constructor method, and it is called when we create an instance of that class: The question mark makes the parameters optional. In Object-Oriented Programming, access modifiers are being used for restricting or allowing to access the variables of a class from outside. There are 3 types of access modifiers: All members of a class are Public by default, this is also an interview question :) So we can (and should) restrict access from outside by adding the private keyword to a class’s members: Javascript is evolving and will continue to evolve. Typescript is just one of the branches. I hope now you have a better understanding of Typescript, if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to ask them in the comment section.

Three Stories Every Entrepreneur Should Know,"Written by Joe Procopio,The Three Story Rule"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Joe Procopio Follow -- 7 Share What would you say your company does? It seems like a simple question that should have a simple answer, but that’s rarely the case. Here’s something I’ve done over my 20+ years as an entrepreneur to keep everyone focused on the tasks at hand while also keeping an eye on the future. Entrepreneurs usually blur the lines of what their startup is, what it will be, and what it should be. This is fine until you try to start planning around those stories. At that point, you need to be asking: What are the priorities today and how do we execute on those priorities without mortgaging the future? The reverse question is just as important: How much time do we spend working on those new things that aren’t generating revenue yet? Every startup should have three stories, loosely related to the three arcs most storytellers use in episodic storytelling. An easy way to think about it is a television series. When you watch an episode of a TV show, the writers are usually working on three storylines: Story A: Story with an arc that begins and ends in this episode (or maybe a two-parter).

The Mysterious ESP-EYE Development Board from Espressif?,Written by Alasdair Allan," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Alasdair Allan Follow -- Listen Share Sometimes new boards pop up on the radar almost entirely out of the blue, like the new Espressif ESP-EYE has done. This one made its way into the hands of Jean-Luc Aufranc, from the CNX Software blog, over the Christmas vacation. “…this is Espressif’s new AI development board featuring voice wakeup, as well as face detection and recognition. It has been built around our flagship chip, ESP32, and it is also equipped with a 2-Megapixel OV 2640 Camera, Microphone, 4 MB Flash, 8MB PSRAM, Micro USB and LED lights on a 21mm × 41mm board.” On the face of it, this is an intriguing addition to Espressif’s product lineup. With most of the major machine learning tools being heavily optimised for Arm-based architectures, Espressif with its Tensilica-based chips is in danger of being left behind when it comes to machine learning on the edge. One of the reasons I was so excited by Seeed Studio’s Air602 module released late last year is that it’s a price comparable ESP8266 competitor that’s built on Arm. On the surface, the board itself looks a lot like a neater, more finished version of the prototype Ai-Thinker CAM board we saw towards the middle of last year, as well a few of the other ESP32-based camera boards I’ve seen. What’s different here is of course that this is, presumably, going to be an “official” Espressif product and that implies a better level of software support than we’ve seen before. But, at least right now, there doesn’t seem to be any details of the software stack they’re using on the board, although it’s likely to be their own ESP-WHO framework. Which is sort of interesting. In fact, there really doesn’t seem to be many details of the new board at all; there certainly isn’t any information available on the Espressif website. Beyond the handful of boards that got sent out to the community over the Christmas break, the new board hasn’t made it into more general circulation. It isn’t yet for sale, and there is no word on pricing or even a release date. So, now all I have to do is figure out how to get my hands on one…?

Gradient Descent,"It is a slippery slope, but promise it gets better at the bottom4,Definition and Nomenclature,Mathematics,Exploding & Vanishing Gradients,Solution: Gradient Clipping,Conclusion,Written by Hamza Mahmood"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Hamza Mahmood Follow Towards Data Science -- Listen Share tl;dr Gradient Descent is an optimization technique that is used to improve deep learning and neural network-based models by minimizing the cost function. In our previous post, we talked about activation functions (link here) and where it is used in machine learning models. However, we also heavily used the term ‘Gradient Descent’ which is a key element in deep learning models, which are going to talk about in this post. Gradient Descent is a process that occurs in the backpropagation phase where the goal is to continuously resample the gradient of the model’s parameter in the opposite direction based on the weight w, updating consistently until we reach the global minimum of function J(w). To put it simply, we use gradient descent to minimize the cost function, J(w). An analogy could be drawn in the form of a steep mountain whose base touches the sea. We assume a person’s goal is to reach down to sea level. Ideally, the person would have to take one step at a time to reach the goal. Each step has a gradient in the negative direction (Note: the value can be of different magnitude). The person continues hiking down till he reaches the bottom or to a threshold point, where there is no room to go further down. Let’s formalize the analogy into an algorithmic form. We compute the activation for the incoming parameters, we carry out feedforward by taking the weighted sum of the activation and its bias. We extract the error term of the output sample by subtracting it with the actual ‘target’ value. The gradient descent process is exhibited in the form of the backpropagation step where we compute the error vectors δ backward, starting from the final layer. Depending upon the activation function, we identify how much change is required by much change is required by taking the partial derivative of the function with respect to w. The change value gets multiplied by the learning rate. As part of the output, we subtract this value from the previous output to get the updated value. We continue this till we reach convergence. In the code below, I wanted to highlight how one can write a simple code to get a visualization of how gradient descent works. Running this piece of code; using the Tanh activation function, we will observe the current value of 10 go down to a value of 8.407e-06 on the 10000th iteration, which is our global minima. There are a number of gradient descent algorithms out there. I’ll mention a few below: If you want to go into the technicalities of the more recent ones, I highly recommend going through Sebastian Ruder’s article on the topic. In deep networks or recurrent neural networks, there are two known issues explained in a paper by Pascanu et al (1994) — of exploding and vanishing gradients. This happens when are doing back propagation as we iterate through the code, there is a chance that the normal of the weight matrices going beyond 1. If this happens, the gradient explodes but if the normal is below 1, the gradient vanishes. If we want to visualize exploding gradients, you will encounter at least one of the problems: The solution to the exploding and vanishing gradient problem, we introduce gradient clipping, where we ‘clip’ the gradients if it goes over a certain threshold represented by a maximum absolute value. Hence, we keep the neural network stable as the weight values never reach the point that it returns a ‘Nan’. In a coded implementation removing the clipped gradients leads to ‘Nan’ values or infinite in the losses and fails to run further. The code below showcases how to perform gradient clipping. Given that we have a vector of losses and a learning rate, we are able to compute a vector of gradients which are next clipped based on a maximum L2-norm value, which in this case I have written as 5. So at the end of the day, when a question is posed to data scientist of what optimizer to use in order to minimize loss, there are a couple of factors to consider: Link of the paper referenced: http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/pascanu13.pdf In this write-up, we covered a number of things: We covered what is Gradient Descent is and how it works in a neural network. We went through the mathematics involved and implemented a coded version of it. Lastly, we covered the issues involving gradient descent in the form of the vanishing and exploding gradient problem and discussed the solution for it using gradient clipping. In the next lecture, we will explore what activation functions are and how they are crucial in deep learning models, so stay tuned for that! Spread and share knowledge.

Product Hunt Radio: Living phone-free in Silicon Valley and the future of music tech,"Written by Ryan Hoover,Quotes from This Episode,Companies and Products Mentioned in This Episode"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Ryan Hoover Follow Product Hunt -- 3 Listen Share With Justin Kan and Ranidu On this episode I’m visiting Atrium’s headquarters in SoMA in San Francisco to chat with two serial entrepreneurs, Justin Kan and Ranidu. Justin Kan’s career blew up in the mid-2000s when he started livestreaming himself 24/7 on Justin.tv, a Y Combinator backed startup that he co-founded. Justin.tv eventually turned into Twitch and sold to Amazon for nearly a billion dollars. He has gone on to found multiple startups since then, including Exec, Whale, and now Atrium. Ranidu has a unique background. Before jumping into tech, he rose to fame as an R&B and hip-hop artist (check him out here). He went on to join Google before founding the first of many startups, many of which have been centered around his passion for music. We talk about a few of them including The Drop, The Artist Union, and Audius, a decentralized audio distribution platform he started earlier this year. In this episode we talk about: We also discuss some of their favorite products including a gratitude journal app that will improve your mental health, a “social network for athletes,” and a tool to help organize your tasks at work. We’ll be back next week so be sure to subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Breaker, Overcast, or wherever you listen to your favorite podcasts. Also, big thanks to our sponsors, GE Ventures, Rally Rd, and AngelList for their support. 😸 “We [at Atrium] have some resources, [we] have expanded, but measuring your company’s success in headcount is like measuring an airplane in weight, so it’s not exactly the right measure of success.” — Justin “As an independent artist today, it takes between three months and eighteen months between the time you stream my music to get paid, and we [at his new company Audius] think that’s wrong in 2018.” — Ranidu “I think the sweet spot [to build a company in the Bay Area] was in 2010 through 2013 or so, where the costs were relatively much lower on the startup salary side. Now your million dollars is good for hiring two machine learning engineers.” — Justin “A lot of days [in my gratitude journal] I write about how awesome it is to live in San Francisco and have all these resources and friends. Life here is great and I think we get caught up in the little bit that is bad and think that everything is bad. To hate on San Francisco is very fashionable.” — Ranidu -- -- 3 Product Hunt Founder of Product Hunt. Weekend Fund investor. Follow at @rrhoover.

Designing With the 2018 iPad Pro,Written by Levi Patton," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Levi Patton Follow -- 3 Listen Share I’ll be to the first to admit that I’m kind of impulsive. And while picking up a new 11-inch iPad Pro definitely qualifies as an impulse purchase, it’s impressive utility as a design tool has more than compensated for some of the post-impulse-purchase guilt. Until now, I’ve never owned an iPad or ever really had the need or desire to own one. So when I picked up the 2nd generation Apple Pencil and started doodling on one of the new iPads to kill time in the Apple Store, my expectations were pretty flat. It was another super pretty piece of Apple glass with a $120 stylus. Oh, it costs another $200 to add on the ‘smart’ keyboard? Classic Apple play. Fun to mess around with on an Apple Store errand, but not something I’d actually consider shelling out for. I sketched a couple quick figures, some portraits, and other random doodles. Whoa, this thing was pretty sleek. The interaction between the pen and the screen was impressively smooth. The sensitivity of the stylus captured my sketchy/messy drawing style surprisingly well. I’ve always loved drawing with pen and paper, but have never really transferred over to digital mediums because you tend to lose that organic feel and style. Not the case with this magic little slate. Then I tried sketching out a couple basic wireframe shapes. I drew a crooked box that I didn’t like, so I double tapped the pen to bring up the eraser in a seamless and intuitive motion, corrected the mistake, and continued on with the sketches. Uh oh. I was officially delighted. Needless to say, I went home with the iPad with the insurance of an extended holiday return policy. I had a month and a half (instead of the usual two weeks) to explore and decide if it was worth the hefty price tag. Pack your bags Frodo, this was going to be a journey. For the next couple of weeks, I explored a huge range of design-oriented apps to put the iPad to the test. Right off the bat, it became clear that some of the most impressive apps (unsurprisingly) belong to the Adobe family. Each of these has its own impressive utility for illustrating and designing. They’re free and integrate with each other really nicely. For instance, you can use Adobe Capture to snap a picture and quickly generate a palette based on the colors in the image and export it to your color library in Adobe Sketch. Adobe Comp works as a quick and efficient wireframing tool for easily creating low to mid-fidelity wireframes: Adobe Draw and Adobe Sketch are both killer apps for drawing and painting. You have a ton of control over your brush tools and pallet; and, there are intuitive finger gestures for undoing and redoing strokes and controlling the canvas. Something else I’ve encountered in working on illustrations and designs with the iPad is how it has fundamentally changed my approach in the creative process. For instance, when I paint with oils, oftentimes I’ll have an idea for adding some shading or accents on a certain part of the painting. If I execute the idea and I end up not liking the result, I can sometimes undo the effect with more paint—at the expense of lost time—but it often ends up completely changing the feel of the painting. This creates a kind of risk/reward dynamic that directly influences decisions when drawing or painting. I’ll often end up being more conservative at the expense of experimenting on a potentially cool effect. Painting, sketching, or designing on the iPad is a distinct experience in the sense that nothing feels permanent. The shortcuts and gestures for ‘undoing’ are seamlessly integrated into your workflow, and it encourages experimentation without fear of repercussion or lost time. This is true for painting and illustration, but also when sketching out wireframes or designing infographics. The ability to move, merge, change, and rearrange so fluidly makes designing on the 2018 iPad Pro an absolute delight. With the cutoff for return quickly approaching, I think this impulse purchase has earned its permanent place in my quiver of design tools; and, it will be an awesome asset for creativity and design moving into 2019. -- -- 3 Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*KN6DJcBQdJvxQSmi-R8tRg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*8ocvfONDqb9f24NTCRivrA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*zcbNchUX2I_IA-qqA3Sk4Q@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:3582/1*whbmst2pgmIr_M_puVMQUg@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:3582/1*Zlnr00Ql1-ORt94CmuplMA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4098/1*fWMgljIso2dXznws1AolNQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:3072/1*0gvJSRup0lwfjsdxOQgV8Q@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4098/1*cxIeELyWqyp142XE56Knlw@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*s1VSNO75gQg1H3RXuNdS_A@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*KN6DJcBQdJvxQSmi-R8tRg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*fS3O2FVZO9h9t1E87ATaww.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*KN6DJcBQdJvxQSmi-R8tRg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*dEAaVbfjoi2PHNRwQfSTwQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*KN6DJcBQdJvxQSmi-R8tRg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*A1lBazmDaA5AHZZFHbWWVA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*KN6DJcBQdJvxQSmi-R8tRg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*6QHaAGV4bp_AAGctwP3x5w.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*4X37q9wlsqgHnYLSgmlNaA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*RNYCdpBO4YrohRtTRX5z4A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*nqaMr-ZyGH9A8kk8RzbQcg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjeiISlLLbvNqfvg8LoZ7w.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*4OSuVPNP-0-Ze8iUSsmY4A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*ACJL3IBZmO1Tw-huBtsu0Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*_wvc1IOHe1qT5s7-hNm2JQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*wzwnJD8UpPtAd2YoIPEiNQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*TcF9rICJPQZsrzNignSvgw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*VWXOGwAskgI1TPehmcx63g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*b4zYnss95wlW-JOhN6VwvQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*5F6PlHIqreKqb7o6', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*k64zdk6Y8nTjBXo5Emn1jQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*RR325hSR_UoWhUGsvDMRaA.jpeg']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@levihpatton?source=post_page-----1971f2157d00--------------------------------,772,4 min read
This Cartridge Turns Your Game Boy Into a Wireless Controller,Written by Cameron Coward," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Cameron Coward Follow -- Listen Share Emulators and remasters are both great ways to step back in time and play your favorite retro video games. But, your controller can definitely hold you back — nobody wants to play Dr. Mario with a computer keyboard, after all. Even if you have a controller with the correct layout, subtle differences in button feel can completely ruin the experience. But if you have a Game Boy, you can now use it as a wireless controller thanks to this special cartridge. The Wireless Gameboy Controller Device is a cartridge that’s compatible with the original Game Boy, the Game Boy Pocket, the Game Boy Color, the Game Boy Advance, and the Advance SP. It’ll turn your Game Boy of choice into a wireless controller that works with a PC, a Raspberry Pi, or a GameCube. That means you can play a game like Pokémon Red or Blue through RetroPie running on a Raspberry Pi, while using an actual Game Boy Color as the controller! The cartridge works by making your Game Boy think you’re playing an actual game. There’s nothing on the Game Boy’s screen, but the “game” still accepts all of the button inputs. Every 2ms, it checks for a button press, and sends those button presses to a wireless receiver plugged into your computer or Raspberry Pi.

Electrify Me: The Lightning Network,"2018 achievements…,So... how does it work?,DDoS vs. PoW vs. PoS,PoW,PoS,DDoS,The Power of Micropayments,In recent news…,Written by Digital Doppelgangers"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Digital Doppelgangers Follow Coinmonks -- 4 Listen Share The lightning network seems to be the answer to all Bitcoin and blockchain related ills: the ideal alternative to the clogged, clumped, over-crowded payment processing ecosystem we’re currently saddled with, with its slow speed, high transaction fees and all-around, ever pervading inefficiency. Surely, with Bitcoin being the natural evolution of currency (and by extension, humanity itself), improved levels of usability should freely follow in its wake — however, as is often the case within the launch of new technologies, the final infrastructure does tend to lag several steps (or miles) behind. With Visa able to process 24,000 transactions per second, Bitcoin Cash 61 and Bitcoin a mere 7 transactions per second, its inadequacy is glaringly obvious to all members of the crypto community. The lightning network grew into prominence during the more nascent architectural days of 2017, before its official, full-blooded incarnation in March 2018. Since then, particularly in recent months, it has travelled swiftly from strength to strength. One of the key players — and early adopters — within the lightning network space is Bitfury. Bitfury is “one of the largest full-service blockchain technology companies in the world”, providing both software and hardware solutions for businesses, governments, organizations and individuals to securely transfer assets across the blockchain network. Interestingly, Bitfury have been the first to fully implement a lightning-network based coffee-purchasing system. Their lightning network engineering team, known as LightningPeach, partnered with payments startup Paytomat in order to launch the lightning network via their platform — an all-around successful integration, garnering further faith in the Lightning Network, and pushing Paytomat up the rankings of revolutionary retribution platforms. Lightning Labs, the infamous proponents of the Lightning Network, have achieved a significant amount over the past year: regardless of Bitcoin’s dips, its ability to travel sideways, upside down and fling itself askance in every other direction, the lightning network itself has gone from strength to strength, unfazed by market volatility. November saw the network top 4,000 nodes and before burgeoning to uphold over $2 million value of bitcoin, its capacity continuing to rise after the spiral of BTC, experiencing an increase of almost 300%. Yes, it’s still possible to remain profitable during a stark, bleak crypto midwinter. For instance, the number of crypto ATMs around the world kept growing steadily, with 209 machines opening around the world in December. Canadian BTC mining company Hut 8 claimed a record high $13.5 million for Q3 2018, and Japanese IT giant GMO reported that its crypto businesses, including mining equipment production and its crypto exchange, gained 2.6 billion yen ($22.8 million) during the same period (although some fraudulent dabbling may have been involved). Open Node, a well-seasoned, dynamic member of the lightning network conglomerate, has begun to painstakingly facilitate the launch of the ideal bitcoin payment processing system, negotiating its widespread acceptance with as many merchants as possible, including Starbucks and Tesla, according to Tim Draper’s excited tweet last month. OpenNode charge a transaction fee of 1%: as far as revenue generation goes, it’s hardly outlandish, particularly when stacked beside a successful, all-encompassing payment network. Top Lightning Network Users of Q4, 2018: The lightning network's mechanism utilizes the relatively young Distributed Proof of Stake (DPoS) protocol, which allows separation of the voting power and block production, with no risks of a hard fork. The BTC Lightning Network, a second layer payment protocol that operates on top of the BTC blockchain, aims to solve the problems with scalability through the use of additional, separate payment channels — a secure and fast way to carry out transactions between a number of users without the necessity of recording them on the blockchain — until the moment the channel is closed. (You certainly can’t avoid it altogether, of course.) These off-chain payment channels facilitate instantaneous micropayments, and a greater, augmented performance for public blockchains. (We’ll expand onto private blockchains shortly.) According to Jack Zhang, “Pow and PoS are easily centralized, while DPoS represents true decentralization. Moreover, DPoS has the benefit of high efficiency, with little resource consumption”. If we’re to engage in a PoW, PoS and DPoS debate, first we need to establish the facts. Distributed proof of stake, alongside Proof of Work and Proof of Stake. The latter two are older, more wearied and time-worn hats, squabbled over copiously during the evolution of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. All three fall beneath the umbrella of consensus mechanisms, which the blockchain/cryptocurrency sphere relies upon — the oxygen of the industry, so to speak. Cryptocurrency, of course, uses distributed ledgers or blockchains to record information, as opposed to a centralised authority, such as a government or a central bank. In the welcome absence of this entity, it is necessary to rely upon an alternative: the consensus mechanisms, all of which borrow certain components freely from one another. All consensus mechanisms work to achieve one, unanimous goal: make it difficult to attack this network, and profitable to protect it. Achievable — yes. Simple? No. Everyone’s favourite — the sanctified system powering Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Miners endeavour to solve a cryptographic puzzle, consisting of the mathematical function (hash). The first mining pool forming a hash with specific properties are remunerated with a few Bitcoins, at estimated 10 minute installments. This acts as proof: they have completed the work required to verify all transactions in a block as valid — the product of their labours is then added to the blockchain. Cons: not energy efficient and lacking in environmental friendliness and adequate sustainability. With PoW, organizations that can afford faster and more powerful processing power usually have a better chance of getting the reward than the others — leading to a more unfair distribution of wealth, which Bitcoin itself was designed to tackle. Ethereum’s considering making a well-timed move over to this one. Why? Because it doesn’t need computers in order to perform repetitive computations, thus presenting itself as a more environmentally friendly, sustainable alternative. PoS replaces miners with validators, in a certain situation wherein they will lock up some of their coins as stake — or a deposit. A group of validators takes turns proposing and voting on the next block; the weight of each validator’s vote depends on the size of its stake. When the validators discover a block which they think can be added to the blockchain, they will validate it by placing a bet on it. The validators will receive a reward in proportion to their bets — we hope. Anyone who holds the blockchain’s base cryptocurrency can become a validator by sending a specific type of transaction to lock up their fund within firm lacerations of security. Also, rewards for the creation of a new block are different: with Proof-of-Work, the miner may potentially own none of the digital currency he/she is mining. In PoS, forgers are always those who own the coins minted — thus drastically reducing the risk of fraud. Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) is a more efficient form of PoS. DPoS uses a reputation system and real-time voting to achieve consensus. Community members vote for “super representatives” to secure their network — these super representatives (very aptly named) will be rewarded by validating transactions for the next block. Better? Yes. As the DPoS vote is consistently on-going, if a super representative does not comply with regulations or perform well, people in the community can remove their votes, essentially firing the bad representative — they are rendered useless. The super representative must obey all rules and keep the network uptime as high as possible, or face the guillotine: a swift, violent rebuttal from its community members. And the best part? It’s a democratic system. Instead of relying on processing power from a centralized authority, bad actors will lose their position and power within the network, at the network members’ behest. These members will maintain the decentralized architecture of the network, as well as benefiting from its speed and agility. As we’re all aware, the power of micropayments is undisputed. Efficiency is the most mandatory component of a financial ecosystem — and mciryopayments can serve as the missing flame, with the lightning network serving as much needed paraffin. “CryptoGraffitti”, the illusory, as yet unidentified crypto and fintech based artist, following the successful auctioning of a micro-painting depicting a black swan, released a statement extolling the many virtues of a future where “micropayments are omnipresent. Artists paid by the view…writers by the poem…musicians by the listen.” An almost intoxicatingly attractive proposal for any independent content creator — and an achievable goal as well. Roger Ver strikes again with what is arguably a barrage of insensitivity, ruthlessly preaching the virtues of Bitcoin Cash, far worthier of the prowess of the lightning network in comparison to its lowly sibling — Bitcoin. Open Node, a prolific lightning network company, has soundly rejected 2.5 million dollars from Roger Ver, to build a protocol on Bitcoin Cash. According to Open Node: “our vision of a better, more open financial system is only possible with Bitcoin.” Cue the sighs of relief from the old religion, crucifix-bearing, holy-water swigging portion of our crypto society, otherwise known as the “HODLers” or “Maximalists”. Bitcoin continues to reign supreme in our hearts and minds.⠀A return of the Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash wars of the past several months? Or another instalment in the battle of investor upon investor? Roger Ver appears reluctant to take on Tim Draper, the principal investor in Open Node, although he remains sceptical of his reluctance to combine BCH with the lightning network. According to Ver: “the Lightning Network would work far, far, far, far better on a system that doesn’t have a limit to the size of the blocks, (like Bitcoin Cash) than it will on BTC.” Point taken — the four “very”s really added some much needed oomph. More slightly negative updates: another ambiguous contributor to the Lightning Network codebase, under the username ZmnSCPxj, has pointed out a stark limitation of this promising network. Its ability to make multi-asset conversions is apparently limited by its current technical design: as the value of trade assets changes dramatically during specified trade windows, cross-asset exchange nodes on the Lightning Network will be exploited to create risk-free American Call Options. According to ZmnSCPxj: “significant liquidity will be tied up in such American Call Options, and they [the channels] find that they will lose funds — especially at times of volatility.” More on this in our next installment, in which we’ll also be addressing the relationship between the lightning network and XRP. -- -- 4 Coinmonks Aspiring tech journalists and innovators, rebuilding this world into a better version of itself.

The Mythical Million Dollar Run Rate,"Written by Founder Collective,Why is this startup going to make the leap?,Remember, you can always stop playing the game"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Founder Collective Follow -- Listen Share People obsess about college rankings, baseball stats, and other forms of numerology out of a natural human desire to simplify and bring order to their world. Seed stage startups often do this by fixating on a single revenue number — a million-dollar run rate. As far as round numbers go, a million dollars of annual revenue is a great sign of progress. Once upon a time, it really was a marker that made a meaningful difference in raising a Series A, but the imaginary milestone of $83K in MRR isn’t the ticket to a Series A that it was five years ago. Over the last half-decade, there’s been substantial inflation in round sizes, to the point where a Series A has the dimensions, and prerequisites, of what would have been closer to a Series B round 5 years ago. When evaluating decks, Series A investors won’t treat companies with $900K and $1.1M in annual revenue differently. Today, the benchmarks to land a series A often include several million dollars of revenue, accelerating at an impressive velocity, and combined with well-rounded leadership teams, and impressive customer rosters. The bar has meaningfully moved from five years ago. Still, many founders fetishize it this one number. They insist it’s what’s keeping VCs from taking them seriously. They’ll increase their burn and spend inappropriately to get to it. And most of the time, this is a waste of focus and resources. The better advice is to grow revenue as quickly as you can, sustainably, and focus most of your attention on helping investors answer one critical question. Venture capital is a velocity business and every good VC’s portfolio is going to have a few companies that have taken off like a rocket ship. Investors want to know why you’ll be like that company, and not one of a dozen slow-growing zombie startups from whose boards they can’t escape. Casper earned $100M its 2nd year in business. Coinbase got to a billion dollars in revenue in under five years. These are outliers, to be sure, and most VC’s portfolios are filled with more modest growth stories, but VC is an outliers business and investors want to believe they have a chance to invest in one. If your current run rate doesn’t put you in that category, you must answer the question of how you will become one. VCs have an idea of what the outlier trajectory of a successful startup should look like, and the steps necessary to achieve it. It’s the founder’s job to connect the dots for the investor and present a credible picture of how they’re making it happen. The challenge is, the longer it takes a company to accelerate, the harder it is to believe the company can become a unicorn. You want your startup to be perceived as a “potential fund returner,” not a “solid business.” When a VC looks at your deck and sees that you’ve spent $5M in various forms of seed funding over the space of four years to get to a million dollar run rate, it gets harder to believe this startup is going to make “the leap” in year four. It’s the founder’s job to tell a credible story about the product launch, marketing channel, or new customer that will triple (or more) your revenue in 18 months. To be clear, the point isn’t that you should mount a PR campaign to try to build buzz for an otherwise struggling startup or start telling stories that won’t come true. Instead, the point is to focus on the substantive changes required to massively accelerate organic revenue growth. Your job is to provide evidence of sustainable and accelerating growth, not to chase expensive and temporary “hacks” to add a small amount of revenue in hopes of meeting a mythical benchmark. More importantly, if your company isn’t on this path and starting to connect the dots to the hope curve, not only will fundraising be somewhat painful, but artificially trying to put your company on this path can be catastrophic. Put simply, don’t spend your last $1M of funding on ads to grow revenue run rate from $600K to $1.1M. Use it to figure out how to demonstrate you’ll be able to go from $1M to $5M. Everything else is a distraction. As David Frankel has explored previously, there are many reasons that revenue alone won’t guarantee funding. A million dollars in revenue won’t get you funded if you’ve got a direct competitor that was founded at the same time and has managed to get to a $10M run rate in the same time. Or if what you’re building a business that doesn’t have a network effect, data asset, or another strategic asset. Instead of obsessing about an arbitrary notion of what some investor might care about and spending your finite resources in a low-probability bid to meet that goal, consider how you might use those remaining seed dollars to get to breakeven and change the game.

‘There’s So Many Different Things!’: How Technology Baffled an Elderly Congress in 2018,"In hearings with Mark Zuckerberg and others, the House and Senate revealed a lack of familiarity with our digital ways,Written by Washington Post"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Washington Post Follow The Washington Post -- 2 Share By Avi Selk If you’re trying to recall what your members of Congress accomplished in 2018, the answer is: They grew older. The 115th Congress was already one of the oldest in history when it convened at the dawn of the Trump administration — average age 58 in the House, 62 in the Senate, 90 billion or so in the relativistic time scale of the online generation, in front of which Congress spent much of the year embarrassing itself. By the time the 115th hobbled into extinction at the end of 2018, artifacts from its attempts to engage the younger folk and their digital ways lay strewn across the Internet like the fossil record of an obsolete species. There were the agonizing video clips from April’s Facebook hearing, in which 68-year-old Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) attempted to ask Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg a question about data privacy, and revealed a conception of social media resembling a wad of tangled Christmas lights: “Do you track devices that an individual who uses Facebook has that is connected to the device… -- -- 2 The Washington Post News and analysis from around the world.

Heinlein for his 1961 science fiction novel Stranger in a Strange Land. ‘Grok’ means to understand so thoroughly that the observer becomes a part of the observed — to merge, blend, intermarry, lose identity in group experience. There are a lot of tech predictions at the beginning of each year. Scientists, engineers, and industrialists trying to sum up results of the past year and identify trends for the new. But as it happens, opinions even from famous experts worth nothing. So I think that we can trust only data for figuring out what is going on in the world. Not forecasts, not estimates, only proven stats from trusted sources. Therefore I want to share with you the most incredible facts and numbers from 2018 which were helping me understand our sophisticated technologies.

The past ten years has seen internet access grow by nearly three billion people, from around 20% of the global population to over 50%, improving literacy, access to information, and introducing the ability to instantaneously communicate on a global scale. Meanwhile, computing power is following Moore’s Law and roughly doubling in cost-to-output every 18 months. Some even predict a technological singularity between human and artificial intelligence when the linear chart ‘goes vertical’. Combined with the realities of climate change, regressive political policies, and coordinated disinformation campaigns, this watershed moment brings the possibility of either catastrophic consequences or vast improvement to global conditions in a relatively minuscule amount of time. In this piece, I will give a brief overview of current conditions in politics, society, and technology, their effects on each other, and how the advancement of blockchain systems can address some of the challenges faced today. In the summer of 2015, when Senator Bernie Sanders announced he would be running for President of the United States, I dropped everything to return to the U.S. and help. What began as volunteering to knock on doors grew into opening campaign offices, organizing events, recruiting volunteers, and more face-to-face political conversations than I could count. Collectively, a small grassroots campaign for awareness began to snowball into the largest ground-swell of political involvement in modern US History. Advocating for Bernie was easy, you just need to empathize with others and share Bernie’s own words. For nearly every reactionary mistake that the US federal government has made in the last 30 years, Bernie has been speaking in favor of progress. Supporting civil and gay rights, opposing military interventionism, and advocating for education and social welfare, Bernie has been tireless in his advocacy for a sensible government that works for everyone. However, there was one campaign slogan that many found hard to support — Political Revolution. For many, the word revolution conjures imagery of violent coups, anarchy, and the guillotine. While this interpretation is not without historical justification, it is not inherent in the broader definition of the word: The paradigms of politics and technology are being challenged, with major adjustments in the very way that we organize and interpret the world around us. Wealthy interests and corrupt politicians continue to manipulate economic markets and governments, often eroding democratic institutions, but the shifting power of technology, communication, and information has presented us with great opportunities. In a democracy, the ability to have open, honest, and fair elections is the foundation upon which all other problems can be addressed. With social media allowing information to be spread faster than can be credibly fact-checked, it is not surprising that falsehoods and outright propaganda have become a major problem. In Brazil, conservative anti-minority and pro-torture Jair Bolsonaro coordinated with international firms to spread lies and propaganda against his opponents through WhatsApp, the popular Facebook-owned messenger. In Russia, the “Internet Research Agency” employed thousands of people to create and disseminate propaganda to US voters, visible to over 126 million users on Facebook alone, and the Mueller-led investigation into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia so far has issued 36 indictments and 5 Trump aids have struck plea deals. We must also be careful, however, we do not react with censorship on the internet itself as a utility. While individual companies like Facebook and Twitter are obviously free to operate freely, banning users, language, and images as they wish, the internet itself as a utility must remain open and transparent, letting the good outweigh the bad. In Syria, the volunteer White Helmets rescue group uses social media, combined with aircraft sensors and machine learning algorithms, to quickly warn of incoming bombs and missiles and coordinate rescue efforts. It is estimated these decentralized early warning systems have reduced casualties by 27% in heavily bombarded areas. The pro-democracy “Arab Spring” movement began with a rapidly shared video of a street vendor setting himself on fire in front of a local government office, protesting the government harassment of his fruit stand. Online communication and coordination spread through numerous countries faster than efforts to censor it. While the spread of falsehoods and propaganda is disruptive, it can be combated with the truth. The more existential threat to elections in the USA is dark money and Super PACs. A Super PAC is a Political Action Committee that is technically separate from and has no communication with, a political candidate. Thanks to the Supreme Court decision in Citizens United vs Federal Election Commission, a Super PAC can raise and spend unlimited sums of money on advertising, not disclose who their donors are, and advocate for or against specific candidates as long as there is no evidence of direct coordination. This is a perversion of electoral democracy that allows secret funding of political organizations to bombard all forms of media with advertising that is often misleading or inaccurate. In the 2016 elections, over $1.4 billion of dark money was spent by Super PACs. Wealthy individuals and corporations give massive amounts of money to both the official election campaigns and Super PACs, and in turn elected officials make decisions at to their benefit. That is, unless you believe it is purely coincidence that Internet Service Providers gave over $100 million to congressional campaigns before Net Neutrality was destroyed, or that Halliburton won massive no-bid government contracts in Iraq while Dick Cheney, their former CEO, was Vice President, or that oil, gas, and coal companies spent $354 million in campaign contributions in 2016 while receiving $29.4 billion in federal subsidies? Or perhaps when President Trump’s Justice Department settled a $230 million Russian money laundering case involving New York real estate for just $6 million dollars, it was a coincidence that the lawyer representing Russia had previously organized the now-famous Trump Tower meeting between herself, Donald Trump Jr., and Trump campaign officials. Speaking of shadowy money, it has been estimated that the Department of Defense and Department of Housing and Urban Development have misappropriated $21 trillion in unsupported adjustments from 1998–2015. The complete lack of voter oversight of how tax dollars are spent is astounding. We also recently witnessed the largest document leak in history known as the Panama Papers, detailing information on more than 200,000 offshore entities and exposing how world leaders, businessmen, and celebrities from over 200 countries used shell corporations for fraud, tax evasion, and skirting international sanctions. Yet despite 1,260 companies named in Nevada alone, almost no prosecution has happened in the USA because companies and wealthy individuals have perfectly legal ways to hide their money offshore. Compounding onto the problem of voter disinformation and dark money influences, the USA faces very real problems of electoral fraud and voter disenfranchisement. While some issues have seen progressive advances in recent decades, such as returning voting rights to felons, the ability for eligible voters to be registered and able to vote should be a non-starter. The 2018 elections were rampant with election fraud and voter disenfranchisement. In Ohio, heavily African-American neighborhoods saw ten percent of registered voters purged from lists, compared to four percent in surrounding areas. In North Carolina, the evidence is mounting that absentee ballots were collected by political operatives and only turned in for Republican voters. In Georgia, 53,000 voter registrants were placed in a “pending” status due to minor misspellings or missing hyphens prior to the election, and a predominantly African-American county had to reject a plan to close seven polling locations. The Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp had removed an estimated 1.5 million people from voter rolls during his tenure and oversaw the very election in which he was running for Governor. Dodge City Kansas, with a population of 27,000, had its single polling location moved outside the city. All across the country, fewer polling locations have resulted in longer lines, with many voters unable to take enough time from work to participate. These conditions happen despite the USA having a very low turnout of around 50%. Studies show that automatic voter registration increases participation, with twelve states having passed legislation since 2015. Moving election day to a weekend or having a national holiday may also increase turnout. The key to addressing major regressive policies is to first confront electoral fraud, voter rights, and the influence of money in politics. From there, voters will have the electoral tools to fight numerous injustices still prevalent in modern society. We could begin with the $5 billion for-profit prison industry that is unaccountable to the public, the growing number of civilians killed by drone strikes, whistle-blowers being punished for legally and ethically telling the truth, or the $100 billion in taxpayer funds awarded to war profiteers like Lockheed Martin and Boeing every year. With better civilian oversight of taxpayer funds, we could implement a universal healthcare system that is not only ethically and morally just, but a Koch brothers funded study found will save money in the long run. Empowering the electorate with transparent, free, and honest elections is the foundation upon which progress is made. Let’s look at how technology will help us in the process. To explain the basic structure of a blockchain, think literally of the words ‘block’ and ‘chain’. In computer terminology, a block is a ‘piece of text processed as a unit’. A blockchain is literally a long string of computer code, with piece after piece ‘chained’ together. In isolation, this is nothing more than a growing ledger of information. The advantage blockchains offer is operating peer-to-peer with no central database. This means every network user reads and writes to the exact same blockchain, also called a distributed ledger. Imagine a giant typewriter, with everybody able to access the keyboard and add their text one at a time. There is just one piece of paper, constantly getting longer. Anything typed onto the paper is permanent and unalterable. This is known as immutability and is one of the most important facets of blockchain technology. Another key function is that blockchains incorporate cryptography through hashing, most often SHA256. This is the act of applying mathematical functions to text, ensuring that only the correct cryptographic key can decipher it. In this way, there are different ‘private keys’ that unlock the ability to access specific parts of a blockchain, known as a ‘public address’, but there is no ‘master key’ that can access everything. This use of decentralized cryptographic networks shifts us from earlier paradigms of law and order. In more chaotic times, the sword was law and disputes were settled by force. As civilization advanced, word became law, and through democratic elections, the populace began to shape legal frameworks. However, words are still open to interpretation by lawyers, and unjust legal practices often apply the law unequally. Distributed ledgers offer many advantages of a trustless system where the code is law. To show how this operates, let’s look at the first and most famous blockchain, Bitcoin. Bitcoin (also written BTC) started in 2009 with a single block being ‘mined’ by the creator, to this day known only by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Mining is when computers on the decentralized network solve the encryption hash to create the next block of BTC and write the network transactions onto the blockchain. Anyone can view any address or transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain by running the network software, or viewing a ‘block explorer’ website such as blockchain.com. By reading the ledger backward, you can trace every fraction of BTC through every transaction back to its origin. For instance, you can view the genesis block at 000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f, where 50 BTC was created at ‘Block #0’ and sent to the public address 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa. This wallet still holds 66.90222543 BTC, and only the person who created this public address (Satoshi in this case) was given the private key necessary to send these BTC to another address. Because the Bitcoin software is open-source, anyone can view and verify the integrity of the software, with no vulnerability or ‘backdoor’. Any change in the open-source code requires a consensus of the decentralized network of miners and users, meaning changes in the code are hotly debated. Bitcoin operates peer-to-peer and encrypted, with full immutability, meaning no individual, company, or country can alter or censor it. This decentralization also allows transactions to happen safely with no trust in other users or a third party required, and double spend transactions are prevented. Bitcoin also has a controlled supply written into its code, with over 17 million BTC currently available and new BTC creation slowing until a finite number of 21 million BTC. This is a stark contrast to traditional fiat currencies such as the Dollar, Euro, or Pound, which can be printed at any time. While sometimes slowed by heavy network usage, the Bitcoin network once processed a transaction valued at 300 million dollars for just 4 cents in a matter of minutes. Using the international banking standard SWIFT costs $15–35 dollars, takes 1–2 days minimum, and cannot be used independently of banks. Because discussion of Bitcoin inevitably turns to prices, I will state simply that early technologies see many price increases and corrections, and it’s best to look beyond this. The internet was not abandoned after Pets.com went bankrupt and Amazon lost 90% of its value in 2000. In 9 years, BTC has exponentially risen from pennies to dollars, from hundreds to thousands, dropping by more than 50% over 8 times, and it is the first generation of new technology. While I must move on, there is much to discuss regarding Bitcoin, including that an estimated 3–4 million BTC will never be accessed due to lost private keys, protecting the network from quantum computers that may one day break SHA256 encryption, how ‘forks’ happen when the network users disagree on updates to the source code, and digital currency competitors that offer faster, cheaper, or fully untraceable payments. To understand how most of the following examples utilize blockchain technology, it’s first necessary to introduce the concept of ‘smart contracts.’ Thousands of blockchain-based ‘cryptocurrencies’ have been created, expanding the capabilities of blockchain and distributed ledgers. While many simply focus on payments and transfer of value, whether faster, cheaper, easier, or anonymous, a growing number are utilizing distributed ledger technology in creative ways. Ethereum, EOS, and other infrastructure cryptocurrencies have code scripting that can be deployed by users. This allows the creation of smart contracts, which are immutable code placed on a blockchain, stipulating what parameters must be met for an action to take place automatically — a permanent and secure ‘if-this-then-that’ statement operating on a decentralized system. Where Bitcoin revolutionized the ability for censorship-proof exchange of value with no middle-man, smart contracts allow for distributed computer networks to run decentralized applications, known as ‘DApps’. In this way, no trusted third party is necessary for an agreement to be made between two users, with any form of digital data being stored or exchanged upon specific code being processed. This is where blockchain technology expands its real-world utilization, and the possibilities are fantastic. Unsurprisingly, numerous cryptocurrencies are focused on the exchange of money or goods. In addition to payment channels, there are blockchain-based companies integrating stocks and securities exchange, allowing users to trade cryptocurrencies pegged to assets such as publicly traded stocks, gold, silver or various national currencies. This breaks down barriers of entry and eliminates brokerages and banks as middlemen. Some cryptocurrency exchanges are even fully decentralized, requiring no centralized system of accounts, passwords, or databases, allowing users to keep control of their traded assets locally. Projects such as Humaniq are working to help members of developing nations who are largely unbanked, bringing beneficiaries out of poverty through financial independence. Manna is a non-profit that’s created a Universal Basic Income available to anyone and distributed through their blockchain. Other companies use smart contracts to ‘tokenize’ real-world assets, such as land and home ownership, art and high-value objects, wills and legal agreements, even electricity usage, and carbon credits. By operating on a distributed ledger, owners can hold the private key or pass legal ownership of assets independently. Agreements can be coded into a smart-contract, eliminating the need for lawyers, making arbitration simpler and cheaper, and ensuring stipulations of the agreement are enforced by immutable code. Further, private or government-run blockchains can provide legal frameworks that are fully transparent, automated, and secure. The Republic of Georgia is currently testing just such a program: “By building a blockchain-based property registry and taking full advantage of the security provided by the blockchain technology, the Republic of Georgia can show the world that we are a modern, transparent, and corruption-free country that can lead the world in changing the way land titling is done and pave the way to additional prosperity for all.” — Papuna Ugrekhelidze, the Chairman of the National Agency of Public Registry of Georgia Because most distributed ledgers are fully transparent and all transactions are traceable and immutable, corruption and misuse of funds can also be addressed this way. Spain has committed to building EU-wide blockchain and AI applications to fight corruption in the EU single market, and the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) is replacing its current system with blockchain technology to cut transaction costs, improve security, and fight fraud. If a government truly wanted all taxpayer funding to be appropriated transparently, a blockchain-based system could audit every penny quickly and easily. Funds paid to contractors, employees, or government programs could be monitored with complete trust and any corruption, bribery, or misuse of funds would be easily identified. Complete transparency and the prevention of fraud is also needed in the global supply chain of goods, where the negative impact of counterfeit goods and piracy are estimated in the trillions, with $200 billion lost annually to counterfeit medicines alone. Tamper-proof packaging with a blockchain-based tracking system that can independently verify the origin, shipping, and handling of medicines will save lives, money, and establish trust between producers, handlers, and consumers. Numerous startups all over the world are competing to secure contracts for their supply-chain ecosystems, IBM is building its own supply-chain blockchain, and DHL has partnered with a blockchain company to track pharmaceuticals from origin to purchase. It’s no surprise that tech companies like Facebook and Google have large amounts of data on users, but recent revelations that Facebook literally gave Amazon, Netflix, and Spotify access to hundreds of millions of users’ private messages expands the scope of unethical use of user data. In the new interconnected global economy, data is currency, but everyday users are left out of the equation. Companies like 23andMe have become popular by mapping your DNA, but there is the caveat that they are able to sell your biological data once it has been ‘de-identified’. Companies such as Civic are using blockchain security to create secure identity login systems with the user in complete control. The Unification Foundation, a company I helped incubate in its early development this past year, is finalizing development of a blockchain-based protocol to standardize data across industries and give consumers full control of every data point. This lets users visualize, manage, and even monetize the data they create, all secured through a decentralized encrypted network they have the keys to. Startups focused on DNA testing, insurance and coverage, medical records, and clinical trial matching are all working to bring ownership of medical data back to consumers. The ability to truly own and control access to your online, medical, and financial data is paramount to personal freedom. Another important use for distributed ledgers is in structural systems of communication and file storage. The ability to communicate freely, without censorship or surveillance, is rapidly being lost. In China, it’s estimated that over 30,000 people are employed as ‘Internet Police’, monitoring websites and personal chats for dissenting opinions to censor, such as the Tiananmen Square massacre or criticisms of President Xi. In the USA, the National Security Agency (NSA) has collected massive amounts of data on its citizens going back to the 1960s, with revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden showing just how pervasive current surveillance is. Projects such as Adamant and Mercury Protocol allow for completely decentralized, censorship-proof, anonymous communication and data transfers. This allows the creation of truly secure data transmission for users as well as applications themselves. Decentralized file storage systems such as IPFS allow users to securely and permanently store or share data. In Thailand, an activist uploaded an anti-government song by Rap Against Dictatorship onto the IPFS storage system, then used the anonymous cryptocurrency ZCoin to safely share the link. The ZCoin blockchain at block 111089 permanently displays the IPFS link, mXFf5QLQi3DhbwyrgR7qH8tHAZcGyWtWtsBy6iij4B7aL, which can be used to access the song. The ability to safely and anonymous share information that cannot be censored is incredibly important. In 2018, 53 journalists were murdered, and at least 251 imprisoned worldwide. Perhaps one of the strongest ways blockchain technology can help secure a stable and free society is through voting systems. In the USA, elections are handled by local and state officials, which has many advantages of not centralizing electoral authority or providing a single failure point. However, this means that there is little consistency between states regarding method of voting, paper trails, or voter identification laws. One major issue in the USA is the use of voting machines. Numerous studies have shown that the machines are severely at risk of tampering and hacking, and one vendor admitted to installing backdoor software into the voting machines. Some states use Direct Recording Electronic voting systems, storing the votes on a hard drive, but have no form of paper trail backup. Voting on a blockchain system would mean that at the time of submission, a voter could view the literal code being input to verify its contents. Voters could be provided a transparent record of votes cast while protecting their, and also providing voters with a decryption key to verify that their vote on the blockchain is correct. Voter registration could be standardized and secure, errors, operating costs, and fraud could all be dramatically reduced by utilizing bio-metric verification of voters. The nation of South Korea, a political party in Thailand, a city in Japan, and the US state of West Virginia have all begun trialing blockchain-based voting systems. In the USA, states that have ballot initiatives and direct issue voting could hold secure real-time voting on a variety of measures. Some states have already begun to adopt election methodology other than the first-past-the-post electoral system which results in only two major parties over time, a phenomenon known as Duverger’s Law. Integrating safe and secure technology into our voting systems can help the push for more fair and democratic election methods such as ranked-choice voting, where voters rank their choices and an automated run-off system determines the most preferred candidate. Human beings are wired for connection. However, we also require privacy, protection, and individuality. As technology brings us together on a global scale, we must ensure that the general population regains control of the structural foundations that our interconnected world is built upon. This applies to communication, finances, personal data, elections, and much more. We are on the cusp of a fully connected and decentralized internet that incorporates not only our phones and computers but increasing numbers of devices in the Internet of Things. We must ensure that the structural systems of communication are transparent, free, and uncensored. And most importantly, empowering ourselves with technology can empower society collectively through transparent code-based agreements, uncensored speech and journalism, secure personal data, and direct democracy that is secure and fair.

Why I Joined TourRadar,"As the company’s first VP of Engineering, here’s why I decided to be a part of this growing travel-tech startup.,Solving an Unsolved Problem,People,Skill Fit,Personal Growth,Written by Paulo André"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Paulo André Follow TourRadar -- Listen Share When I landed in Berlin in the early hours of 2015, I had no idea what was in store for me. Almost four years later, I look back on a journey of massive personal development, thanks to the rollercoaster that is working at a hyper-growth technology startup. Throughout my time at HelloFresh, change was the only constant; my role kept morphing every few months, even if the job title sometimes didn’t. The company quickly went from startup to scale-up and being an early employee on the tech team — eventually moving up to a Director of Engineering role — gave me the opportunity to amass a lot of experience in many areas: technical leadership, hiring and firing, performance management, organisational design… the list goes on. But eventually, the time came when I felt my personal growth was no longer aligned with the company’s growth and I knew I had to move on. Being ambitious — and sometimes a little too eager — I wanted to leverage all the learnings by taking a shot at leading an engineering organisation within a smaller startup looking to scale up. I yearned to be given the trust to build a world-class engineering team. With this in mind, I started opening my ears to all the executive recruiting approaches I was getting, engaging with those I found interesting. That’s how TourRadar soon popped up on my radar and, once I went through the whole interviewing process, I had a decision to make. It has now been 3 months since I joined the company as their first VP of Engineering. So why did I join TourRadar? The first thing that got me excited about TourRadar was that it seemed to be solving a problem that had not yet been truly solved — bringing multi-day touring online, a business that for the longest time was done through brick and mortar travel agencies. I quickly realised the challenges in selling this type of product online had to be very significant: a marketplace model, with high basket sizes and multiple touch points on and off-site. No wonder it was being touted as the “last frontier” of online travel. The fact that travelling, especially for longer periods of time, can be transformative, coupled with the technical and business challenges I could perceive, made the company’s vision of “connecting people to life-enriching travel experiences” one I felt compelled to work for. And from a business perspective, it became obvious that solving this challenge at scale, with no real incumbent in sight, could mean massive upside in a global, multi-billion dollar industry. Naval Ravikant once said of choosing a co-founder: “If you can’t see yourself working with someone for life, don’t work with them for a day.” While it may be a bit exaggerated, I think there’s a lot of truth to this. Working on interesting problems is only truly rewarding when you do it alongside great people that bring out the best in you. It was therefore important to me, throughout the hiring process to try and figure out whether I saw myself working with the people at the company. As I was interviewing for an executive role, and thanks to a well-designed interview process, I had the chance to talk to multiple people in the organisation. I felt somehow immediately connected to the leadership team, to whom I was asked to do a presentation, and was appreciative of the fact that they all gathered to attend my presentation live, including those in Canada and Australia at odd hours of their day (or night). As for the engineering team, to whom I also gave a talk on a topic of my choice, they listened closely and proceeded to grill me on different subjects, which I really enjoyed as it showed they were genuinely curious and truly invested in their work. Overall, what struck me is that everyone asked really great questions. The clincher on the people side was talking to two board members. Instead of selling me the company, they sold me the challenge, and that made all the difference. It was encouraging to see the company being backed by very experienced people, with their feet firmly planted on the ground, but obviously believing (and invested) in the company’s long-term success. My time at HelloFresh exposed me to many stages of growth and scale, something that I imagined made me an interesting prospect for TourRadar. The way I understood the role of VP of Engineering, the company was looking to scale up given their clear product-market fit. This, for me, meant working hard at setting up a tech platform that would enable TourRadar to scale its operations as smoothly as possible and continue on a strong growth trajectory. When thinking about what goes into building this platform, more than executing anything hands-on, I believe the VP of Engineering role is about creating an environment where excellent execution takes place. This means hiring the best and best-suited talent for the company’s goals, developing the people already on board and maximising their potential, designing the tech org in a way that reduces friction and promotes agility and flow, ensuring we are collectively building the right tech stack, and so on. All of these I was exposed to, at scale, at my previous role. While I would definitely have opportunities to improve existing skills, I could also see myself being pushed way out of my comfort zone — which would be crucial for my personal growth. To name a few examples, it would be the first time… Some trepidation aside, all things considered, the opportunity was just too good to pass up. It also helped that when discussing it with a mentor of mine I got nothing but encouragement. And in any case, I knew that if I worked hard, focused on asking the right questions, and connected with mentors outside the company, things would be alright and I would be able to really grow a lot in the process. When thinking about the next steps in your career, it is important to understand that interviewing is a two-way process — companies interview you as much as you are interviewing them. However, without a clear idea of what matters most to you next, it becomes quite difficult to suss out those things in a future employer. For me, the ability to have a significant impact in a high-potential business, with a challenge that pushes me beyond my current abilities while working with great people is the “superformula” I was looking for, and I can’t wait to see what 2019 has in stock for us.

How Game jams are an amazing way to learn game development,"Where to find one?,How to get a team?,Can I do these solo?,What if I fail my teammate?,Idea…?,What tools to use?,How does submission work in these?,Written by Parminder Singh,What is a Game Jam?,My Game Jam Experience!"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Parminder Singh Follow Chingu -- Listen Share So you have a lot of interest in game development but you have no team. Also where will you get an idea to build a game about? Game Jams! It is a contest where you get a theme in start and a deadline before which you need to finish and submit the game. It is like a hackathon but for game developers. There are always 10+ game jams running simultaneously on Itch.io. So you can easily find one that fits your schedule. If you are very busy you can pick a weekend one like I did. One amazing thing about these game jams is that there are always Discord channels or Forums associated with each. Here you can post the type of work you want to do and you can team up with others that are finding you. It can be scary most of the times to ask out someone. But has it ever been easy? Think it this way, you are here to learn. You want to enter this contest so at end of it you know a thing or two more about game development than your current self. These jams are popular enough that you will surely find another newbie teammate. Yes, there have been game developers that are successful as solo devs. But personally I prefer working with a team. It divides the work and you finish faster. Speed is important in these jams. Keep this pressure, use this as a motivation that you want to prove yourself. There is a limit to your knowledge but you have to push it. Also your team should always decide a game idea that would not cause a lot of pressure. Keep a simple and enjoyable idea. As a beginner your idea must be simple like a platformer, endless runner or a puzzle game. Mix in the game jam theme in it. e.g. if the theme is “hangover”, make an endless runner with an alcoholic man. If the theme is “sun”, make a platformer where the main character can drop a sun beam from above. In games, the best fun arises when you use something familiar to the players and add a twist to it. I used Unity engine as it is very beginner friendly and you can easily search your errors. It uses C# for its code. Don’t worry if you don’t know C#, there are a lot of other solutions too like Phaser (JS), Godot (Python-like), Pygame (Python), Pico-8 (Its own lang) and many more. You can choose the one that compliments your coding skills. For the art and music, there is no special need. Use whatever image editor or audio editor suits you. It depends on the organiser but there is mostly public voting. You put in your game files and create a eye catching page and description. You need the attention of people! So that you get more plays and you get more reviews. The players then rate your game on various factors like Art, Sound, Story, Innovation etc. At end of the judging period, your game is given some rank which you can brag about. The reviews show the ratings on each aspect so you can improve on those next time. This ends the motivation part :) I had bought a Unity course recently and I started to follow it. Unity started to seem interesting and easy to work with. Now I wanted to build using it! I knew about game jams by then because I had made a game previously. It was very bad because I went the solo path. This time I wanted a teammate along with me! I have an online friend from Sweden that loves to make art. She had never worked on any game either so I asked if she could join in and she agreed. Her first question was an obvious one. But what will we build? I looked on itch.io’s game jam calendar. Christmas Game Jam looked great! The exact theme was to be declared the next day. The themes I pre-planned were, Now we waited, and on Saturday morning I open up the page and theme was “You’re on the naughty list”. I brainstormed for fifteen minutes and then came up with the following idea: An endless runner where Santa will drop gifts into houses that can have nice children and naughty children! With this idea in place we had the key elements of our game. We had to be fast as we had just two days! Every game needs some music, and I found some stock Christmas music that sounded good. Then I needed to make it turn on and off. I needed the settings on the main screen. We decided the game name will be… “Santa delivery”. At end of the first day, I learned to build a Game Manager singleton! It made everything very simple. It is like a store in Redux if you have a React background like me. Now, instead of making the game itself, we made the gameover screen instead. Then we called it a day. Next day we had to build the game! Here is the advantage of being in a team: while I am working on orienting a bunch of white squares on the screen and making them work, she was building the assets for Santa, houses and gifts. Asynchronous execution is beneficial if the Promises resolve. :) When the Santa was done, I had finished the gift dropping Meanwhile I also caused some “weird” bug. But at end, everything worked out. We submitted the project, Santa Delivery, on Christmas Eve! :) I even published it to the Google Playstore for showing to my android friends in the future. Then I got the feedback from friends and family. They loved it! Meanwhile I also got comments on itch.io submission. And finally, we got the score and ranks! To conclude, if you are into game development, I highly recommend taking part in game jams. You’ll have something to show your next employer, you would get tons of ideas that you won’t make for the game jam but you can build those in the future. You get a quantified score and reviews that help you in finding out what skill you need to improve. -- -- Chingu https://trion.me I write code and blogs!

How to be successful in your first tech interview,Written by Colin Smith," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Colin Smith Follow -- 1 Listen Share Looking back, I have no idea how I passed my first interview. I remember I did alright but definitely failed one or two portions of it. I also did it completely over Skype which made the whole process way more painful. Definitely not a performance I can look back on and be proud of but it did land me my first internship. Back then, I had no idea what companies were looking for. I thought that finishing most of a problem would be enough. Or showing that I somewhat understood what the solution might be might get me through. I thought that was all I needed for a company to give me a chance. I was naive. Companies are taking a huge risk whenever they hire a new employee. You need to make sure that the company you are interviewing for will be excited to have you onboard. If you’ve achieved that, then you’ve nailed the interview. Looking back, I have no idea how I passed my first interview. First things first, highlight your strengths. What makes you a strong candidate? What will set you apart? I knew my background in teaching gave me a unique perspective and skill set. Regularly presenting in front of a lot of people allowed me to bring something extra to the table. And I’d much rather speak in front of an unimpressed software engineer over a group of pissed off teenagers any day. I made sure to take advantage of this skill during the interview. It especially became useful when chatting with the CEO of the small company I was interviewing for. I also had gone above and beyond on a website project I did for my degree program. The requirement was to have a basic HTML page with some JavaScript backing it. I decided to go the extra mile and to dive in and learn Angular and integrate it with my page. I am glad I did that because I got a new, fancy framework on my resume by taking on the extra work. On top of that, I got a great working of example of the shiny UI which was a great show piece. It showed that I was interested in new technologies and applying them to the work I did daily. It was also a great talking point during the interview. It gave me the chance to show that I could learn a new skill in a short amount of time and apply it meaningfully. You may find that you are stretching your resume to meet the requirements of a job. If you find yourself in this situation, then consider doing some open source work or applying for an internship. Both of these experiences will give you the valuable opportunity to contributed to a larger codebase. It also shows that you can collaborate with other people in a codebase. This is a skill most companies look for when hiring since it is vital for thriving in most modern tech companies. The second thing I would recommend is reading up on the company that you are applying for. What would a hiring committee for that company look for in a good candidate? Maybe some companies want a candidate that writes a lot of code quickly. They may want a quick learner that they can put on a project right away. Other companies may want a deep thinker that can plan out architecture and write comprehensive tests for code in production. It all depends on the kinds of projects that the company is working on. Sending a rocket to Mars requires much different code and processes than sending a tweet. Sometimes employees and ex-employees at companies will list projects that they’ve been apart of on their LinkedIn. This can give you a better idea of what kind of skills and the type of employee the company values. You can also ask someone directly involved in the hiring process about the current projects the company is working on. Don’t be afraid to ask questions about the company and the interview process itself. This is a two way street, and companies want to take on people that are excited to work for them. This can also lead to some insights on how the interview process will be structured. In general, I tend to ask if the interview will be more algorithms and data structures based or more domain knowledge based (in my case I ask if I can expect mostly questions around iOS). The last thing I recommend, is to practice. It sounds lame, but practicing with a friend in person does wonders for getting used to the interview environment. At first it might feel strange, but try to take it seriously. And always put on a timer for each question. You will have a limited amount of time to solve a problem during an interview, so getting used to tracking time is a good habit to get into. After you get the hang of solving questions on a computer, move on to a whiteboard. A lot of tech companies still force the use of whiteboards during interviews so having some practice with them can be helpful. Once you’re ready, go in with confidence. You can breath easy knowing that you’ve prepped and put some effort into getting ready. If you fail, no biggie. There are a ton of companies out there looking for candidates. You will have gained some knowledge on that particular company’s interview process. You will have also hopefully taken something away from the interview that you can go home and improve on. I’ve failed over 30 interviews in the past 4 years. We all fail. But as long as we’re picking ourselves up again and learning something from our failure, then we can treat each failure as a little badge of honor. -- -- 1 From wandering ALT in Tokyo to top tech company (think FANG) in NYC.

Escaping Into Virtuality,Written by Alice Bonasio," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Alice Bonasio Follow Tech Trends -- 3 Share Is Virtual Escapism going to become a thing as our reality becomes increasingly hard to deal with? As the late screenwriting legend William Goldman famously said; “nobody knows anything” so predictions — specially about technology — always run the risk of making people look silly in the not-so-distant-future. That said, I’m going to go out on a limb and say that in the next few years we’re going to see more people becoming “Virtual Reality Refugees.” By which I mean that immersive technologies will provide increasingly attractive alternatives for those wishing to escape the dreamlike madness that has overtaken our real world. 2018 has been a remarkable year for immersive technologies (which include the whole spectrum of Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality). We’ve seen compelling use cases emerge for AR, VR and MR across education, industry, retail and training, as well as the increased acceptance of it as an art form, with festivals all over the world dedicating space to showcasing VR strands. The Raindance Film Festival, for example, received 600 VR submissions this year, including the first feature-length feature in the format.

Hello World,Written by Brittney Ball," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Brittney Ball Follow -- 8 Listen Share I would first like to Thank You for taking the time out to read my first “official” blog post! Since this is THE FIRST I think I should give a somewhat brief introduction on who I am, why I decided to start blogging, what you can expect from my blog, and why I chose to title my blog “The <B> Word”. I am originally from Washington D.C. (born and raised), but decided to relocate to Charlotte N.C at the beginning of 2018 to start a new life in a city that I was somewhat familiar with. I had heard that the Tech scene in Charlotte had been developing and since my contract with Georgetown University was ending soon I felt like that was the universe giving me the green light to take a chance and start over fresh. I was able to secure an apartment for my boys and I and immediately started the dreaded JOB SEARCH after. I had been meeting with different recruiting agencies, sending out hundreds of resumes, and it always ended with similar if not the same results… “ Dear Ms. Ball, we appreciate you coming in to interview with us but at this time we are looking for a candidate with a little more experience.” Can you say discouraging! I began to doubt myself and my decision to move my little family to Charlotte. One day, I decided to try a different method of getting my foot in the door of one these tech companies. I decided to research companies in Charlotte and find the top five that I would like to work for and look up developers who were already working there on LinkedIn and introduce myself that way! Hey, they say sometimes its not what you know but who you know that gets you in, and what did I have to lose? Luckily, the first developer I messaged on LinkedIn immediately responded back. He informed me that the company he worked for was currently not hiring but he recommended that I join a local meetup group called the “Charlotte Devs”. He said that they might be able to assist me on my job search. I wasted no time joining the meetup group and was added to the slack workspace. I introduced myself right away and shared how the interview process had lowered my confidence and how I really just wanted to find a great company that saw my potential and would be willing to invest in my growth. Moments later I received a private message that reassured me that Charlotte was where I belonged. “ Would you be interested in interviewing for a position here at SKOOKUM?” Ummm, YES PLEASE!!! By this time I had heard amazing stories about the Skookum culture and how it was voted one of the number one places to work in Charlotte. I was soo excited! Ok, let’s fast forward 6 months into my internship at Skookum, which was originally suppose to only be a 6 week contract role (big smile)! At this point I’m full of nerves because the internship is almost over and I didn’t know whether or not I was going to have a job offer in the end. I couldn’t sleep. Anxiety started to set in. I turned to twitter for motivation and to reassure me that “I’VE GOT THIS”. As I sat in bed reading everyones testimonies about how coding had changed their lives I decided to post a tweet to remind myself of how far I’ve came and to let others know that with determination and desperation you can change your situation. I woke up the next morning and my tweet have went viral! I was amazed that what had seemed like such a simple tweet to me resonated with soo many people. This was thousands of strangers telling me how proud they were of me, that they were rooting for me, and had NEVER met me in person. My day had been made.. or so I thought. I went in to work and shared what had happened with a few of my coworkers who were just as excited and shocked as I was. By the end of the day I received the message I had been anticipating…a slack message from the Engineering Director asking to meet with me. I instantly thought “aww man let me find a box to toss my stuff in” LOL. I can’t remember how long we talked honestly because I was soo nervous that it seemed like everything was moving in slow motion and then I heard it… we would like to keep you on FULL-TIME as a Software Engineer!! Tears of joy burned my face because even though my learning journey wasn’t over I had finally found a company that believed in me and wanted to help me grow! A viral tweet and I was brought on full-time that same day!! November 28th was honestly the best day for me in 2018. Since I was now officially a Skookum employee I had decided to share my story with my coworkers since the tweet sparked some curiosity and they were already aware that I had taken a non-traditional route into tech (Self Taught). After hearing my story I was asked if it would be ok to publish my story on the Skookum blog and of course I said “YES”. Since then the article and my tweet have been shared all over the different social media platforms, it’s been featured in different tech newsletters, and shared on other websites. You can read the article HERE. Which brings me to why I decided to start a blog. It wasn’t because I’m a millennial and almost every millennial wants to be a successful blogger LOL. It was because I feel like I have something important to share with others. I want to show people what my journey through tech looks like as a working SINGLE mother, as a minority, and as a woman who happens to be self taught without a college degree. I want to continue to inspire those that may think that they can not succeed by sharing my truths no matter how ugly. I want to show people tech through my eyes. As I learn I will share my methods of learning, the difficulty level, and what I struggled with. I also want to give my thoughts on important nontechnical issues that matter such as diversity and inclusion in tech that often gets swept under the “rug”. Majority of the time when I read tech blogs and feel intimidated because the authors seem so senior and robotic. I can’t relate or really follow what they are trying to teach because it doesn’t seem like they are writing for the newbies. That’s where I plan on picking up the slack (ha ha). My plan is to make this blog the “watering hole” for developers of all skill levels. And now i’ll explain the why I chose to title my blog “The <B> Word”…. It honestly took me two weeks to find a name I liked that correlated with my blogs purpose. It had to be edgy, punny, and simple. After being smothered in brain fog I decided to use one of those name generating websites LOL. The first name that came up was The B Word. I thought “hmm I like it” but how can I incorporate tech? Presto!!! I turned the B into the <B> tag!! Which gave the title soo much more meaning!! I knew that seeing the title peoples immediate thought would shift to the profane word most commonly used to degrade women, and I wanted to challenge that way of thinking by adding a positive twist. The <B> is bold, strong, and demands attention and that’s EVERYTHING I want this blog to be. So there you have it! A brief introduction of what you can expect from my blog in 2019! I hope I piqued your interest and you continue to come back. Thank you for being apart of this journey with me and HAPPY NEW YEAR! -- -- 8 Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*fCCCBSeaq4oqAEmB2mjZGA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*Vbs-5WcCjvZ1JDojrhb41Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*fCCCBSeaq4oqAEmB2mjZGA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*od_NEb8qyh9bPvfDaClmXA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*fCCCBSeaq4oqAEmB2mjZGA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*FqrBHT_S1rz67AQdhd3nJA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*fCCCBSeaq4oqAEmB2mjZGA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*8bLw9pVaRfqJzMYy', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*fCCCBSeaq4oqAEmB2mjZGA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*Eh-FKByN1sxVd_y-Z9Hf-w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*fCCCBSeaq4oqAEmB2mjZGA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*yr2O5U-a0-rfY34C6yOXMw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*_3WdkzQRqIq8tt3Wh-WhbA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zPtGTCNOwu1p3kzn_sZFVQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*kQIvhDkl0ixPpv4z', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*ERYx0IB1pN-5ZX98cKAoUw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*nChshyHhYer985FIUWu6TA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*maC8NLpto3tNwluhoRODsw.png']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@brittney.ball07?source=post_page-----e6933ff22ac7--------------------------------,563,6 min read
ONEROOT Announces New Economic Model of RNT,Written by ONEROOT," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in ONEROOT Follow -- Listen Share Related video: https://youtu.be/ItZ0D04Gohc Founded in April 2017, ONEROOT is a blockchain technology solution provider focused on the development of underlying technologies. It is committed to building industry infrastructure, breaking the application threshold of blockchain technology and facilitating more external resources to enter the blockchain industry. Over the past year, ONEROOT has successively developed a decentralized transaction protocol R1, a distributed decentralized exchange DDEX, a distributed centralized exchange DCEX, high-performance public chains RNC, a user terminal Touch Wallet and other products, which have won recognition from top international partners in the industry. Mutual benefits and shared achievements are the consistent concept of ONEROOT, of which the core is fair and efficient transfer of value. RNT is the bridge connecting all links of the ecosystem, and therefore has a solid value base. With the rapid development of the blockchain industry, ONEROOT ecosystem continues to expand. As a result, the service targets have become more diversified, and new application scenarios have been emerging. Meanwhile, the functions and positioning of RNT have also changed. To this end, we have refined the application scenarios, clarified the relationship between supply and demand, and explained the value base of RNT from the function aspect. Transaction Scenario Transaction is the most mature application scenario in the blockchain industry and one of the main development directions of ONEROOT. Insufficient liquidity along with high development and maintenance costs is a challenge for all exchange operators. Guided by the concept of mutual benefits and shared achievements, ONEROOT’s trading solutions allow operators holding traffic to quickly deploy distributed exchanges, share transaction data and liquidity, meanwhile, improving transaction efficiency and greatly reducing the cost of R&D and maintenance as well as access to traffic of operators. As DDEX and DCEX bring together more and more exchanges, all participants will win through sharing. Within the ONEROOT distributed trading system, RNT has the following functions: (1) Stake or pay a certain amount of RNT to cooperate with ONEROOT to build DCEX or DDEX; (2) Discounts will be obtained for using RNT to pay transaction fees (see the rules of each cooperative exchange for specific rate); (3) After fully circulated, RNT will be used as the basic token to open trading pairs on all DDEX of ONEROOT; (4) Holding a certain amount of RNT will allow you to apply for token listing on ONEROOT DDEX where all RNT holders will vote. Once passed, the token will start for transaction on all ONEROOT DDEX; (5) RNT holders can participate in the vote for token listing. Public Chain Scenario Public chain is the underlying infrastructure that connects the ONEROOT ecosystem. For this reason, ONEROOT has developed an asset-friendly, high-performance public-chain RNC. By mapping external assets and built-in decentralized exchanges, it is possible to securely and quickly realize the registration, distribution and circulation of assets. This also, breaks the performance bottleneck of Ethereum, which greatly enhances user experiences of decentralized transactions. RNT will serve as fuel to drive RNC operations, including: (1) Be used as Gas when transactions are sent, contracts are executed and other operations are conducted on the chain； (2) When trading on DEX, you can get a corresponding fee discount if you hold a certain amount of RNT; (3) Be used as GAS fees for operations on other chains Technical Services and Ecological Expansion As a leading blockchain technology service company, ONEROOT can provide all-round and reliable support for the demand side. With the continuous increase of partners, the ONEROOT ecosystem will continue to expand, giving RNT a more solid value base: (1) ONEROOT will provide technical services such as decentralized transactions to the demand side without charge. However, in order to protect the rights and interests of users, the demand side needs to stake a certain amount of RNT as a security deposit; (2) Due to limited human resources, ONEROOT cannot provide technical services to all demand sides at the same time. Therefore, users can get priority by paying a certain amount of RNT. This part of the tokens will be directly transferred into the address of the ONEROOT Foundation and be managed by the Foundation. Tips: As a digital business infrastructure, ONEROOT welcomes all merchants to provide services in the ecosystem. However, in order to protect the rights and interests of users, merchants need to stake a certain amount of RNT. The benefits that ONEROOT receives in the ecological cooperation will be returned to the holders of RNT in the form of airdrops. Metaphorically speaking, if a blockchain project is regarded as a human body, tokens are the circulation system that connects various organs, transports nutrients and transmits values. Meanwhile, the economic model is the operating mechanism of the system, which directly determines whether the project can develop healthily. How to design a self-consistent economic model is a proposition that all projects are constantly exploring. The significance of RNT is to rationally distribute relevant benefits so that value can be circulated among all participants to form a fair and efficient business collaboration model. A healthy economic model is not static. While ONEROOT is still a new project and with consideration given to the development of the ecosystem, we acknowledge RNT will face various problems. However, we believe that with the support of the community, ONEROOT team will adhere to the initial and make positive adjustments. At the same time, RNT will also play an irreplaceable role, and continuously enhance the intrinsic value with the support of global traffic. Tips: The total amount of RNT is 400 million and there will never be further issue. Currently, RNT can be traded on dozens of exchanges around the world: ________________ English: Telegram-en/ONEROOT web/R1 protocol Reddit/Twitter/Medium/Linkedin/Facebook/Github Instagram: @onerootnetwork Youtube: @OneRoot Project Korean: Naver blog/Kakao Chinese: Telegram-cn/Weibo Official QQ group: 6644849 Official WeChat account: oneroot_admin -- -- oneroot.io Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*FDvvDBPT447tUBsJWORTQg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*lFMLplWpmyX5DXc6BugOFg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*QaWyN3_43hQVkosOjAmESQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*eXrwazkqNGHaixAPLj4_YA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*ipt4o-4BuQzAJlM6ib8Y8g.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*bWxiCBQVkNTtS5VhY47OdA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*FDvvDBPT447tUBsJWORTQg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*yuVzMhCJyDENbyhwAsrkwA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*FDvvDBPT447tUBsJWORTQg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2RAQDluxcHsWB-N9htmeTA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*FDvvDBPT447tUBsJWORTQg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*_DOv-KQWvoKkaOuotPQ2Tw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*FDvvDBPT447tUBsJWORTQg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*yuVzMhCJyDENbyhwAsrkwA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*FDvvDBPT447tUBsJWORTQg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*cBIFfjjqzx8pzaemnAM0rQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*EhiV5eo34TIkvI6u-JFYmg.jpeg']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.com/?source=post_page-----3c9ce69ef622--------------------------------,3,5 min read

ByteDance is Beating Facebook in India"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Melanie Mohr Follow -- Listen Share While we’re busy at WOM Protocol creating a brand new user-generated marketing channel that incentivizes and rewards honest word-of-mouth recommendations, I’m going to talk about marketing and social media trends in this article of 2019. I’m digital media professional and entrepreneur with 20 years of experience in editorial strategy, content creation, digital marketing and mobile applications. I’ve founded YEAY and WOM Protocol to help Gen Z creators truly expand their digital footprint as pioneer creators. But enough about me, marketing and social media are incredible domains of mobile, storytelling, video and youth culture that’s creating a tapestry of engagement never been seen before in the history of the internet. While some of us are bringing word-of-mouth and content distribution to distributed ledger technology and dApps, older social platforms continue to evolve as consumers prefer new behaviors and more trendy channels. With 8,000 followers on LinkedIn, I’m posting across channels bringing awareness and advocacy for GenZ-centric solutions. As retail and technology brands need to scale their influence they are realizing the importance of establishing peer content and relatable influencers who create user generated content that are relatable to their audiences and truly foster the spirit of their brand communities that reflect and build true loyalty among their customers. The push for social media followers and engagement online is augmented by real people, someone that is the face of the brand that’s not only knowledgeable, but someone you can trust that has customers and their preferences at heart. The personal brand has never been more important as in 2019. Vitalik Buterin makes Ethereum relatable, just as Elon Musk makes Tesla have its own magic. Trust is a funny thing with brands, it’s hard to build and can be lost easily enough. Social media and marketing isn’t just about engagement, but mattering to consumers. Nike’s Ad on Colin Kaepernick wasn’t just inspirational, it was genius. Nike sales reflected that. Brands need to connect with the values of their target audience and truly connect for both trust and inspiration to occur. In many cases, it’s really that simple. The modern consumer is on mobile, while chatting, while perhaps consuming another screen. So how do you stand out with a brand story? Increasingly micro video, stories, and micro video apps are engaging Millennials and emerging Gen Z consumers that break through the noise for a few powerful moments. TikTok grew its user base in 2018 while acquiring musical.ly but providing a new kind of storytelling. Instagram became even more popular in 2018 by adopting Snapchat like disappearing micro video stories. The social media feed has been altered in 2019, and will never be the same again. If you are an advertising platform like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or any other big one — chances are a lot of your traffic and accounts are not real. The bot purge of 2018 has led to other adaptations of fake traffic, such as fake sponsored content, fake influencer marketing metrics, and campaigns that are able to alter human behavior into “bot-like” behavior patterns online. Therefore newer platforms with more AI are likely to have an edge over older platforms that are easily hacked by collective sentiment manipulation. In our transition of mobile consumption patterns to video, YouTube > Instagram & Facebook combined. Considering the traffic changes in 2018, 2019 is the year of YouTube and Twitch (Amazon) like experiences that younger consumers prefer. They consume a lot more video content and the rest of the world is only starting to catch up as how we behave on social media changes. This means creators on YouTube can grow more sustainable brands that transition better to other micro video apps. YouTube’s algorithm appears superior to Instagram’s for getting high quality content to rise to the top. YouTube and Netflix are likely to have a good 2019, because it’s all about creating high quality content. It’s a bold statement but I believe blockchain tech will truly begin to impact content distribution and social media platforms in a more mainstream way in 2019. Video and social apps might start to utilize cryptoeconomic principles, incentives or a cryptocurrency like a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar that might go more mainstream such as one on WhatsApp that is planned by Facebook’s blockchain division. If FAANG stock and crypto are both experiencing “corrections”, what’s to say that the two won’t get married and overlap in some significant way? Obviously I’m biased to the WOM token based on the WOM Protocol. In an era of media publications going the subscription model route for the best revenue generation without advertising traffic manipulating their results, something incredible is occurring. Brands are bundling their subscription to target shared audiences. Recently in China, Alibaba backed Ele.Me teamed up with Bilibili in a promotional discount subscription, to get the best of both worlds. Both of these services target Millennials and GenZ mobile users hyper-active with digital consumption. Alibaba in fact, has a kind of joint subscription model for many of its related apps and partners that reminds one of Amazon Prime, but for content and O2O service apps. For discount savvy Millennials, this is the ultimate strategy. Brands in 2019 will need to do less Ads (they won’t be as efficient) and drive more organic traffic via authentic content. Besides creating incredible content, influencers and brands need to participate actively on niche channels such as LinkedIn, Twitter chats, Facebook Groups, Subreddits, apps that relate to their domain (such as Telegram and Discord if blockchain) and optimize traffic from curator and app congregation sites such as Flipboard, Medium, Hacker News — and wherever else they can show value. Organic referral traffic boosts SEO and visibility of a piece of content and alerts algorithms (and in some cases curators/editors) to pin the content in a tag. A good piece of content must be relatable, having emotional impact and elicit comments and strong interactions. These signals again tell the AI on an app or platform that it’s valuable. In 2019 a more authentic internet will be forming with algorithms that are less hackable. If you have been following apps like Snapchat that have been doing some interesting things with AR. AR could bring in new content delivery approaches that could be immersive and helpful for content creatives and brands. Where I’m a bit more excited is in how interactive AR content could create more collaborative social media experiences. As compared with VR and chatbots, I find AR much more direct-to-consumer friendly. But could AR touch our mobile-native emotions? Maybe not as radically as some marketers might hope in 2019. Gen Z (born 1995-) are a rather large demographic who grew up on mobile and support things like crypto, decentralization and online entrepreneurship. However they also appear more inclusion orientated, with a stronger activism spirit than Millennials, and perhaps more street smarts combined with business smarts. Whatever your opinion of young people these days, they are incredibly important to many brands, as they have entered the workforce and have time and money to spend. In 2019 there will be a fair degree of hype and information about how to reach Gen Z better and create customer experiences that attract them. Micro influencers deliver more ROI than typical big-time influencers since they have tight niche peer to peer influence usually targeted to a particular audience. Since they are viewed as even more authentic, they are also considered more trustworthy. As influencer marketing continues to scale, their influence is stretching to Gen Z apps where micro video content predominates. This is meaning brands and influencers have more opportunity to grow in the new kinds of aspects of the attention economy that are coming into being. Micro influencers and micro video should continue to gain in importance in 2019. As Amazon and Walmart battle over India’s E-commerce market there’s an even more interesting phenomena going on with apps. 2019 is then the year when India’s attention economy succumbs to Chinese apps. This idea that Chinese companies cannot scale globally is no longer true in 2019, as ByteDance’s apps are becoming popular in India. In fact, the Chinese takeover of Indian app ecosystem and its attention economy appears real. The data appears to be pointing to ByteDance taking over Facebook’s place globally, starting with Asia. China’s influence over India with companies such as Xiaomi, Ant Financial, Huawei and others is only getting started.

Agile development from a programmer’s perspective,"What is Agile ?,Why is it considered important ?,Find the Best Coding Tutorials & Courses - Learn to Code | gitconnected,Written by Dasith Kuruppu"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Dasith Kuruppu Follow Level Up Coding -- Listen Share I have been practicing agile for a few years now, and over the years I have come to form a few opinions / beliefs of my own. Specifically where things can go wrong in agile and where things can be improved in the process. Before going forward If you haven’t practiced agile you may have a few questions — Agile development refers to any development process that is aligned with the concepts of the Agile Manifesto. Its important because it addresses many critical shortcomings on traditional methods like the waterfall & spiral methods.The Manifesto was developed by a group fourteen leading figures in the software industry, and reflects their experience of what approaches do and do not work for software development. There are several implementations of agile, scrum being one of the most popular and one which I have been adopting for the past few years. Something I have noticed that is done by most people (my self included) while following agile, is that they often skip major steps or values that are core to the agile process. And such things result in agile being practiced in very unproductive/counter-productive and frustrating ways for both developers and product owner. Let’s take the most popular agile implementation — scrum.The basic values essential to scrum are : Courage could be realized in many different ways. Courage is shown by disagreeing with something the product owner wants (with reason of course). Courage is shown by accepting failure and being honest with the product owner when something does not work out as planned or expected. Courage is shown by saying “NO” to product owner when asked to take more tasks than you can handle. Courage is shown by disagreeing or pointing out flaws to your team or superiors. Courage is also shown by rigorously defending what you believe or know to be true and even more courage is shown by accepting and realizing what you knew, held or believed to be true is actually wrong! All this may seem like something that is up to an individual, but I think it to be quite different. I believe that ideally in a scrum team all members must create a platform on which members are encouraged to put forward their ideas, thoughts, arguments, and concerns before a team comfortably and without any repercussions. Some members may voice their concerns or thoughts no matter what, as it’s in their nature while others may try to hide behind the ones that do so and simply nod away. A good scrum team should identify those members and bring out to share what they have on their mind, as it is often the case that they hold a lot on their mind without the courage to bring it before a team. If no one is having disagreements or saying “no” occasionally, it’s an indication that there is something wrong. One of the most important factors that I personally feel that should be focused and encouraged are these people who say the hard truths or bring up the unsettling but necessary facts as its often an uphill battle for the ones that do raise these concerns. This will help in identifying key failing points in projects and thus enabling action for recovery or an early failure rather than waiting until it is too late. Agile is all about improving with feedback and, more often than not, courage becomes the basis for the feedback to happen. Therefore, courage plays a major role among the rest of the values. Focus, this means that the focus is usually limited to a “sprint” which narrows down the scope of a project by what “tasks” are taken into the sprint. A sprint can be a predetermined length of time on which all members commit to delivering a set of tasks within that period of time. A selected set of tasks are focused on each sprint. This works and seems great in theory. But sometimes it is necessary to consider a possible direction the project would take in the long run when taking on a task so that you don’t end up crippling your project progress later on. Say when a major refactoring or in worse cases an entire rewrite of a module or modules occurs, which could have been avoided with a bit more planning or more insight on the project. This means focus on a sprint by sprint basis is good, but you must also plan with awareness as to where the project is finally heading. Commitment, there needs to be several commitments for scrum to work. First everyone on the team needs to make a commitment towards the tasks that are taken into a sprint and the sprint goal, not just as an individual but as a team itself. Another important commitment is that you commit to scrum fully and not just skip parts of scrum when it feels convenient. It is also equally important to know that this commitment should never turn into a hard-coded contract where all the tasks taken would be expected to be delivered by the end of the sprint. It is all about showing the effort put forth by individuals and the team and being fully transparent throughout the entire process. In a complex, creative, and highly unpredictable world of software development, a commitment on this scope is often not fully possible. Agile is a way to address this major issue when unpredictability and frequent changes in scope over time could not be matched with an initially agreed rigid plan. If you are doing things in such a way, you probably are practicing something entirely different than agile, and in my opinion, should never be practiced in such a way and would end up leaving a bad impression to all parties in the end. Respect is another important factor that is essential for agile to work. This involves believing that people that you work with are naturally resourceful, creative, and capable. This also requires an unbiased hiring practice where hiring takes place purely focused on individuals skills / abilities and the results produced. Given that both these factors are available, this creates an ideal platform for people to respect each other regardless of people’s diverse backgrounds, experiences, and range of skills. Once this platform is created, it is all about trusting the team to do what they do best and getting everyone more autonomous by accepting them as professionals who organize and manage their own work. We also respect that people are doing their best given what they know at the time and their current resources thus we enable transparency and change of actions / direction headed. We create a platform on which everyone's opinions and perspectives are given the opportunity to be heard. When people feel they have been heard and taken into consideration, it becomes easier for them to fully support and respect the team decisions even if the decision was not their preference. Transparency is another key factor in an agile environment. Being open about our work helps create transparency about progress, success, and failure. Without transparency, any attempts to inspect and adapt will be flawed. Transparency coupled with Respect enables team members to ask for help and get help from anyone. Transparency also helps teams to make mistakes, accept them, and take the necessary corrective action while being fully open about it. This helps all involved parties to be aware of it and help in a positive way to take the necessary corrective actions or change direction. This transparency should also be a two way street where both the development team and the product owner alike is transparent on what they are doing or planning to do. This creates a much better understanding and trust between the two parties allowing better products/ results. If the above values are present within an environment where such values are appreciated and actively practiced, only then could it actually be called “agile”. Often, it is mostly the process or efficiency of a process that companies seek to improve by placing less significance on the values. However, one needs to realize that there is a fundamental trade-off in simply focusing on optimizing a process. Running an efficient process requires standardization and control to yield predictable outcomes which often comes at the cost of innovation, which on the other hand requires experimentation. It means trying new things, most of which are going to fail. It is often essential that innovation takes place as well, or you would end up with the most flawless and efficient process that is years obsolete. I believe that innovation, research, and trying things out is one of the major factors often lost, forgotten, and missed from a sprint or hidden from product owner as something that’s straying far from sprint goals. However, in a forever changing world of software development, it is important that this is given a significant focus and the transparency it deserves!

Latin American tech and VC in 2019,"Let’s start with regional trends,Some random sector notes,Written by Federico Antoni"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Federico Antoni Follow -- 1 Listen Share As with many other amateur writers, my writing is first a personal exercise. It’s my way to process what I see, organize my thoughts and understand my world. It helps me have a prepared mind when investing and supporting portfolio companies. My predictions for the year are notes to self, as subjective and informed as for the next VC’s opinion. I submit these thoughts so you know me better and somewhat understand what I do. I post these predictions to start the conversation for the year in Latin American tech — plus it’s a fun exercise. If last year felt confusing sometimes depressing, this year will feel worse. The world will face new challenges under terrible leadership. Absent a violent and unexpected shock, the US will fare well economically but will probably have a year of reckoning dealing with its daemons. Fred Wilson has a bold prediction on this. A global bear market coupled with unprecedented volatility will mostly spare the startup economy more vigorous after a rally of IPOs in the first half of the year. Despite the resilience, global venture capital will appear more scarce due to more cautious investors and global volatility. Investors tend to focus on portfolio allocation and follow-on rounds when going through an economic downturn. One unexpected consequence of US travails may be American tech investors seeking additional diversification outside of the US either by pushing portfolio cos to expand internationally or by investing directly in high growth verticals in promising markets. They will realize Uber IPO premium price on Lyft comes not from US market leadership but from international exposure. Silicon Valley investors that ventured outside of the comfort of the bay area will begin to outperform peers. LPs will take note. I think the massive trend of venture capital globalization as seen below will get stronger this year. In this context colored by our own national complications, Latin American tech will cement all the progress made during the fantastic 2018. I think total VC investment for this year will miss last year’s mark while the number of deals will go up. In a nutshell, if nothing terrible happens, 2019 will feel like a long year but one where Latin American tech has a chance to thrive. Bring it all! I wish you all a happy year, full of learnings and love. -- -- 1 Lucky guy Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*rVWnxK-wTfAWAru6vckOAw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/0*UDrm8YWmxiFjYuIr.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/0*hEOXaYWoCoLE2_TT.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:936/1*cNSACxI0ZD2Qh2ia1D972w.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*rVWnxK-wTfAWAru6vckOAw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*yuVzMhCJyDENbyhwAsrkwA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*rVWnxK-wTfAWAru6vckOAw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*yuVzMhCJyDENbyhwAsrkwA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*rVWnxK-wTfAWAru6vckOAw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*IjIN1rzukr5JhQec.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*rVWnxK-wTfAWAru6vckOAw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*H4nOlAex3sUHwdUv5TTPdA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*rVWnxK-wTfAWAru6vckOAw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*Ans6sKAILtR_3JrzUVH-5A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*2s48FXT-YXuen8EdcpUWog.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*7-Vd2V6yvsrRROavIg5RFg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*iQJjezE8PMsrLMJyhgmWDA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*SSldMA8f2cLiwAZDfFFwVA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*v81PL_0CTnry3iWQHBAKpQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*TQlEMeYwwWc38Wqm7EfCTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*0-N4JrXpZG1KJfIrAutd3A.png']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.com/?source=post_page-----40e3eefacf9e--------------------------------,81,4 min read
"How To Create A Serverless, Zero Infrastructure, Zero Administration Data Lake With Amazon S3, Amazon Athena and Apache Parquet","We have launched a code-free, zero-admin, fully automated data pipeline that automates database, table creation, Parquet file conversion, Snappy compression, partitioning, and more.,Get started with Amazon Redshift Spectrum or Amazon Athena for free!,Written by Thomas Spicer,Getting Started With Data Lakes,Why Amazon S3 and AWS Athena For Your Data Lake?,Get A Code-free, Ready-to-go Serverless Data Lake Stack,Start Small, Build On Success"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Thomas Spicer Follow Openbridge -- Listen Share If you have read about data lakes they conceptually seem like a viable approach to fusing together all of that organizational data locked away in silos of web, mobile, marketing, social, CRM….systems. In fact, teams are using innovative serverless data lakes to fuel their data analytics efforts using tools like Tableau. Note: If you are wondering “ what is a data lake?”, you can start with our post on the topic. While promising, we know building data lake can seem like a daunting proposition. It is difficult to understand exactly what is needed to get started given all the different, and sometimes costly, options that exist in the market. We are going to describe a serverless solution stack of Amazon S3, Apache Parquet, and Amazon Athena for your data lake. This approach means no infrastructure to build or manage. You also do not need to worry about configuration, software updates, failures, or scaling your infrastructure as your datasets and number of users grow. This will free your team to focus on use cases of data consumption via tools like Tableau, not the underlying system development. When teams can realize “quick wins”, they can build the confidence needed to establish organizational velocity. This allows teams the ability to explore creating, low cost, low-risk data lakes that allow them to focus on having data at the ready for analysis, reporting, or other business activity.

That is the only way to serve the country. I know of no better.” Dr. B.R.Ambedkar (in his last speech to the Constituent Assembly) Summary VVPAT’s purpose is to provide a voter verified paper trail to audit whether EVMs have recorded votes correctly. So proper audit with an adequate sample size is the essential aspect of using VVPATs and without proper audit VVPAT may become just a tool to fool voters giving them a false sense of verifiability & scrutiny. ECI has not been carrying out proper audit or even its July 2017 decision of 5% audit in the elections in last one and a half years. And if mismatch is detected in the arbitrary miniscule audit of 1 booth/constituency ECI EVM VVPAT manual July 2018 doesn’t even have a direction or clause to do/allow the necessitated full VVPAT audit . ECI has also vehemently opposed several cases by various parties in courts requesting for proper audit. Courts have evaded responsibility by leaving discretion to ECI & has failed to make ECI accountable. Mainstream media have remained silent even on grave issues like mass voter deletion & widespread mismatch in votes counted & polled suggesting EVM error/rigging in elections. In such an environment in which the Elections with EVM VVPAT technology is made unaccountable , the transparent & time tested Paper ballots must be preferred. Use of EVM VVPAT should not be allowed without proper , statistically sound audit & election rule for necessitated full VVPAT tally on mismatch in sample audit. Merely focusing on EVM ban has allowed grave issues of EVM VVPAT use to go unnoticed & unquestioned. The purpose of VVPAT is to provide a voter verified paper trail to audit whether EVMs have recorded & reproduced votes correctly. This audit checks whether the results from EVM are correct & the election is valid. A Voter checks at the time of voting whether the paper record of his vote is correct by verifying the VVPAT printout. The check whether the vote has been correctly recorded by the EVM is done by tallying aka auditing an adequate & statistically sound sample of this VVPAT slips. VVPAT Mismatch means the votes recorded by VVPAT & EVM don’t tally. This is definite evidence of EVM error or EVM rigging. So if any mismatch occurs in the representative sample audited, it suggests that the results by EVM counting in the constituency is wrong & hence a full 100% VVPAT count of all booths of the constituency is essential to find the people’s mandate or result. The most important elements of a valid audit are adequate sample size , transparent & independent randomization & full VVPAT tally on any mismatch. (Describing more on VVPAT here as most voters & even political party leaders doesn’t seem to have enough info about VVPAT, Significance of proper randomization , Meaning of mismatch & Necessity of full audit on mismatch — This also shows why paper ballots are much preferred. ) ECI currently only allows VVPAT audit of 1 booth /constituency. In most constituencies this comes to about 0.4% of VVPATs used. For example in Gujarat election there were 50128 booths for 182 constituencies. So about 0.36%. aka 182/50128 booths were allowed to be audited there. And on detecting VVPAT mismatch ECI’s EVM VVPAT manual (Please read the full manual- ECI site — Archived file) doesn’t have a clause or rule for the necessitated full audit of all the booths of the constituency. Yes you read that right . There is no clause or rule for full audit on mismatch in the election manual. This defeats the very purpose of VVPAT audit (even on a proper sample size) & makes VVPAT a mere tool to fool voters. Current rule on detecting mismatch is clause 56D(4)(b) , That is to accept the VVPAT tally instead of EVM tally in that booth with mismatch . There is no provision or rule to do/allow full VVPAT audit of all booths of constituency to detect peoples mandate which has been shown(by mismatch in sample) to be wrongly recorded by the EVM. There are different types of election result audits like fixed percentage random sampling, fixed number random sampling, risk limiting audit etc. Risk limiting audit sample sizes will depend on several factors and may vary from constituency to constituency & is done in stages . So it may make the election process further opaque to a population mostly clueless about EVM & VVPAT. So a fixed percentage/number audit across constituencies seems more adequate for India. In context of General elections 2019 , this article “Transparent use of statistical methods can help detect rigged electronic voting machines” by ISI (Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata) faculty discusses the statistics on percentage of VVPATs to be audited. This analysis by ISI faculty tells the following “Let us take four different possibilities of level of potential rigging into account at the constituency level: 25%, 10%, 5% and 0.5%. We assume an equal distribution of 1.8 million EVMs across 543 constituencies. Tallying 11, 29, 58 and 534 V-VPATs per constituency would allow us to find a rigged EVM with 95% probability for each of these four scenarios.” This is after considering 1.8 million evms for General election that is about 3314 EVM/VVPATs per each of 543 constituencies. So if there is 15 lakhs votes per constituency, to detect a rigging of upto 7500 votes with 95% probability we need an audit of 534/3314 (about 16%) VVPATs per constituency. Hence we need an VVPAT audit of at least 16 % to ensure the validity of an election won with 0.5% margin that is 7500 votes.(approximately) Next important aspect of audit after adequate sample size will be transparent & independent randomization . If process of randomisation is compromised the sample of VVPATs selected can be made non representative of the constituency being audited. So after having an adequate sample size the randomization procedure in the selection of that sample must be transparent & must ideally be done by a party not directly responsible for conduct of election . Most importantly Full VVPAT tally of all booths of the constituency in case of mismatch( in the sample audited) is what allows the audit to correct the wrong results shown by the EVM. This Full VVPAT tally ensures the people’s mandate prevails over the EVM mandate. Without this full VVPAT tally VVPAT/sample audit serves no purpose & only helps in deceiving voters. After SC intervention on delay in implementation of VVPATs, On May 12 2017 ECI made this press release titled — “Meeting of all Political Parties on issues related to EVM/VVPAT and other Electoral reforms” ( after upgrade the new ECI website doesn’t have link to the old press releases). In it ECI said “The Commission will count V-VPAT slips up to a definite percentage, which will be determined by the Commission. The ECI will be shortly evolving an appropriate framework in this regard.” On July 6, 2017 IndianExpress(IE) reported on the front page “EC to tally paper trail slips with EVMs in 5% booths in each assembly seat” , the article also had details on how the 5% VVPAT audit decision was reached. The article also said “The decision on compulsory counting of paper trail slips, which was approved by the full Commission before Nasim Zaidi retired as the Chief Election Commissioner on Wednesday, is a response to the demand made by political parties at a meeting held by the EC on May 12.” Inspite of this 5% audit decision — On October 10, 2017 Indian express published report titled “Will compare VVPAT paper slips in one polling station of all 182 assembly constituencies: CEC on Gujarat polls” On December 7, 2017 hearing a petition on use of VVPATs & request for VVPAT audit in Gujarat Elections, Gujarat HC ordered — “Even though we are not inclined to accept the petitioner’s suggestion of full manual counting of votes, to inquire from the EC, whether any framework for sample counting of VVPAT slips along with EVM votes on random basis bas been set up or not.” In this December 8,2017 IE report (Gujarat elections: High Court notice to EC on counting of VVPAT slips) on the above December 7 Gujarat HC order it is reported that “The EC, however, opposed the petition claiming that EVMs are tamper-proof and paper trail can’t be counted.” On December 8,2017 after the December 7 Gujarat HC order enquiring about framework for VVPAT audit ECI made press release telling VVPAT audit of 1 booth/constituency will be done . ( after upgrade the new ECI website doesn’t have link to the old press releases) December 7, 2017 Gujarat HC order can be accessed here & final Gujarat HC order on December 12 here On December 1 ,2018 Economic times published this report — ‘After ISI report, EC to decide on raising polling stations where VVPAT slips matched with results’ This comes about one and a half year after, not carrying out 5% VVPAT audit decision & conducting several state elections without proper audit which essentially makes the elections invalid. In it then CEC tells ECI have asked ISI for a report on how much should be the sample size( of VVPATs audited) “for 99.99 per cent confidence level with near zero error” This sounds promising, but can well be an attempt of further deception. As can be seen from analysis above by faculty from same ISI , we seem to need a sample size or VVPAT audit of more than 16% for this 99.99% confidence level with near zero error. Coming from ECI that has not done any meaningful audit & doesn’t even have a provision for full audit on mismatch this said upcoming ISI report(if it comes) has to be watched carefully. It was said in the Newsreport that the ISI report will come after recent five state elections are over. The said ISI report needs to be in public domain well before notification of General Elections 2019 , so that political parties & voters may study & respond to the adequate sample size suggested by the ISI report .(If EVM/VVPAT is used in General Elections) On October 24,2017 petition was filed in SC by All India Congress Committee (AICC) Secretary Prakash Joshi, seeking a direction to the Election Commission of India (ECI) to frame appropriate rules, regulations and guidelines for the counting of VVPAT paper trails. On October 30,2017 SC bench of CJI,Justice A.M. Khanwilkar , Justice D.Y. Chandrachud disposed off the petition wp(c) 983/2017 citing “As far as Prayer (b) is concerned, it is urged by Mr. K.K. Venugopal that guidelines have already been brought by the Election Commission of India. The same is disputed by Mr. Kapil Sibal and Mr. Vivek Tankha, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner. We leave it to the discretion of the Election Commission of India, as we are not inclined to enter into the said arena.” (This case happened before Gujarat HC intervened(December 7,2017 HC order as above) in the matter. By intervening Gujarat HC ensured ECI atleast does the token arbitrary audit of 1 booth/constituency. But later Gujarat HC also followed this SC Judgement.) The SC order can be accessed here On November 20, 2017 same SC bench dismissed wp(c) 1012/2017 petition requesting removal of clause 56(D)(2) of the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961 , which leaves decision to recount by VVPAT to the sole discretion of Returning Officer. The order can be accessed here On December 15, 2017 Secretary, Gujarat Pradesh Congress made plea in SC to cross-verify 25% VVPAT-EVM votes in State polls. SC bench of Justices CJI, A.M Khanwilkar & D Y Chandrachud refused plea making some oral observations (see this newsreport) “Do you have any cogent material to show us that the EC’s decision was taken arbitrarily? We can only exercise our judicial powers after positively concluding that EC has exercise its powers arbitrarily.We have to be slow in a case when the EC has already taken a decision, How can we discredit a process?” The arbitrariness of ECI decision to audit 1 booth/constituency or about 0.36% of VVPATs & the need for statistically significant audit was not brought up by the petitioners counsel. Petitioner’s counsel also failed to bring to SC’s notice the July 2017 decision of ECI on 5% VVPAT audit. Neither was proper & statistically sound audit, stressed as necessary part of people’s voting rights. “Bench also said that the cause of clean elections is anyway covered when a candidate reserves the right to demand a re-count of votes polled from the Returning Officer concerned. This safeguard is provided notwithstanding the the “one-booth formula” directed by the EC.” (quoting from the report) Same bench had dismissed petition(as can be seen above) seeking amends to clause leaving the decision of recount by VVPAT to the sole discretion of Returning Officer. This right of candidates to ask for recount with VVPAT is almost never allowed by returning officer .For example recounting with VVPAT on request was allowed only in 2 of the 50128 booths in Gujarat Elections.(See here) . On October 12, 2018 SC bench of Justice A K Sikri & Justice Bhushan dismissed petition by Kamal Nath seeking 10% of randomized VVPAT audit & to provide electoral rolls in text format to detect deletion of voters & other pleas regarding electoral roll manipulation . The bench depended on past SC orders dismissing pleas for VVPAT audit which had left discretion to ECI . “In view of the orders dated October 30, 2017 passed in W.P.c No 983 of 2017 and on the basis of statement given by the ECI in the Court, we do not intend to entertain this relief” Read the full judgement here Several lakhs of voters were deleted by ECI from voter list by linking aadhaar “voluntarily”(EC to Link Aadhaar-Voter ID? It Already Did So Without Our Consent) in several states . In Telengana this amounted to about 22 lakh people or about 8% of electorate(Mass deletion of voter names reported in Telangana polls). ECI did almost nothing to correct this deletions & even didn’t allow request of opposition parties to postpone election(Deletion of 30 lakh Hyderabad voters worries Election Commission) to allow time for correction of voter deletions. After Disenfranchisement of lakhs of Indians Telengana CEO “Apologised”!. (‘Sorry, will take special measures next time’: Telangana CEO apologises to Jwala Gutta, others for missing voters names) Then on January 1, 2019 EC went on to announce dates for Telengana panchayat elections (Rural polls to be held in three phases) without rectifying the mass voter deletion. New CEC had this to say when enquired about Telengana incident in this interview (We have zero per cent tolerance for malpractice, says CEC Sunil Arora) - “On Telangana, it is very ironical that ever since these technology platforms have come into the electoral rolls, whatever the manual issues used to be, the mistakes that were not detected, are now getting detected.We have ERONet on a pan-India basis. So, in Telangana, the same people complained to the Hyderabad High Court. We gave our side of the picture and the petition was dismissed. (contd)” Then in the same interview he went on to tell one of his major agenda is to make the electoral roles Purer. In another report(Up to 15% of voters left out of rolls, without even a fair hearing) on a study done by EPW in Karnataka tells “ Up to 15% of the total electorate of around 130 million adult citizens is missing from the electoral rolls. Data also showed a disproportionate exclusion of Muslims, and pointed to the possibility of similar exclusion among marginalised castes.” The report goes on to further tell “Out of 2.8 lakh new applications for enrolment during 2017–18, a high 62% were rejected — as many as 18% were denied on the ground of not being Indian citizens and 24% for unspecified reasons. To put it more dramatically, among the total number of rejects, around 30% were rejected on the ground of not being Indian citizens and 39% for reasons not publicly available.” In Telengana elections votes counted in several constituencies were more than votes polled, DeccanChronicle reported it on front page as Tally mismatch in Telangana Assembly poll results: Are winners losers?. It was aptly referred to as Electoral mockery . This report from vijayakranthi news shows Votes counted were significantly more than votes polled in at least 31 constituencies. This occuring in several constituencies points to large scale EVM error or manipulation & essentially makes election invalid. A full open immediate VVPAT audit in these constituencies was a minimum step to be taken by ECI in this serious incidence. But even with written request from political party representatives nothing was done by ECI. The CEO tried to refute the newspaper reports, but those attempts fell flat (CEO’s clarification on vote mismatch proves wrong). This serious incident happened after election commission refused to postpone elections as political parties pointed out issue of deletion of lakhs of voters from voter lists. This mass voter deletion & widespread EVM error/rigging was mostly not covered by the national or other state level mainstream media. On 27th December,2018 VVPAT slips were found to be removed from VVPATs in Jubilee Hills Constituency , This happened despite EC clause that printed slips must not be removed from VVPATs for 45 days after declaration of results . This points to grave misdoings & also essentially makes delayed VVPAT tallies meaningless .Read the news report here -Slip out: VVPAT slips go ‘missing’ in Jubilee Hills, Congress demands re-poll In Gujarat elections the headlines after election read “100% Match Between EVMs and Paper Trail Slips on Random Vote Count, Says EC Official” but the report showed there was mismatch in at least 4 seats. “There was a mismatch of some votes on one booth each of these four seats. This occurred because the Returning Officer must have made the same mistake but it could not be detected earlier. So we took into account VVPAT slips for these booths during the counting and resolved the issue,” said Gujarat Chief Electoral Officer B B Swain in the report. The mistake CEO is talking about here is the nonclearance of mockpoll . But if it was indeed mockpoll not being cleared , checking the mockpoll form tally would have solved the issue with clarity & CEO wouldn’t have to make the assumption of “RO must have made the error of not clearing mockpoll results”. Anyway currently with VVPAT mismatch even if it was not a mockpoll issue & indicated EVM error/ rigging , the returning officer will just show the election manual & tell, we have no option or rule for full VVPAT tally , so just take the favour of accepting the booth tally & live with it. So essentially no VVPAT mismatch comes out , its always a 100% match on audit. This report (#MadhyaPradeshElections2018: What explains the delay in counting?) from MP election tells “On the day of counting, the State Election Commission informed that the figure of such polling booths where CRC had not been removed after mock polls have increased to 175 across the state.” The curious case of increasing number of uncleared mock polls is a concern. According to EC EVM VVPAT manual returning officer have to sign a form telling mock poll results have been cleared before start of election, & this has to be verified & signed by polling agents. This high number of uncleared mock polls causes unnecessary delay in counting( as VVPAT tallying will be done in those booths) & may give counting agents a false sense of VVPAT audit which is being done on a non representative sample. Paper Ballots makes election process transparent & allows the common voter to easily understand the election process. It ensures each vote is counted by direct verification. It also allows interpretation of votes without need of technology as a middleman. Paper ballots don’t need elaborate security checks & measures as EVM VVPAT and only require secure printing & full video camera monitoring(without power cut)during poll and post poll to verify & ensure integrity of election. Only real advantages EVM may have over Paper Ballot is prevent votes being invalid & slowing ballot stuffing , that can happen during booth capturing. But with EVM, instead of booth capturing, capturing can happen at state level or a national level and can still go undetected without proper audit of adequate sample size. And after doing proper audit we need full tally on mismatch & an accountable ECI to ensure peoples mandate prevails over EVM mandate. As we saw in Telengana – (where at least in 31 constituencies votes counted were significantly more than votes polled ) - even a widespread EVM error or a badly executed EVM tampering can go undetected till the last moment of counting . Nothing has been done by the ECI to stop the results in Telengana. ECI has not even done an immediate full VVPAT tally atleast in these constituencies to detect the source of error/fraud .Courts will be slow to spring into action & usually refuses to intervene in election results. Paper ballots will have made the error/fraud visible to public on the day of election itself. With EVM the trends of election may go wrong till last moment of counting till proper audit (if implemented) is done & the EVM results needs to be corrected based on the full audit . Hence Paper Ballots seems to be the much better option in front of a technology & system that can and has been made unaccountable. Only place EVM/VVPAT have some relevance is problem areas where it may help in slowing ballot stuffing in case of booth capturing as described above . The malfunction rates of VVPATs are often high & is a cause of concern. (‘Over 2,400 VVPAT machines malfunctioned’). Also there are conflicting reports of VVPATs' performance during increased heat & direct light. see these reports( Former CEC, Experts Challenge Election Commission’s Theory on VVPAT Failure , VVPAT may hit poll result ) . Even ECI manual tells “Don’t allow direct light or high power illumination over VVPAT.” (Page 129). Political parties & Citizens must take a firm stand without further delay that- Paper ballots must be used at least in problem free areas. Political parties & Citizens must not go into EVM/VVPAT elections without - Proper VVPAT audit with adequate sample size — Every vote must ideally count & Time must never be a constraint in deciding peoples mandate. — At the very least we must have a VVPAT audit that is capable of detecting upto 0.5% rigging with 95% probability , which requires about 16% audit as pointed out by analysis of ISI faculty above. Election commission must implement rules or clause allowing necessitated full audit/tally of 100% VVPATs of a constituency in case of mismatch in the sample audit. Supreme Court can be approached but in recent cases Supreme court have failed to make ECI accountable to citizens. If cases can be presented well in the SC by professional lawyers the bench will be able to understand that a proper audit with adequate sample size & full audit on mismatch are basic part of citizen’s voting rights & are needed to ensure the elections are valid. The status of ECI’s ISI report on VVPAT sample size for “99.99% confidence level with near zero error” must be enquired. But waiting for the report to act will not be helpful. Extra adequate/set number of VVPATs must be tallied on contestants request for recount. Contestants may be allowed to pick VVPATs for this audit. (removal of notorious clause 56(D) (2), that has taken away right of candidate to ask for VVPAT tally) Other measures needed include Randomisation must be transparently & independently done In case VVPAT slips are not properly recorded , provision must be there for reelection if indicated by the margin. Political parties must educate election agents about — How results are invalid or not final till proper audit & full VVPAT tally( if needed )is done ,importance of randomisation, meaning of mismatch in sample audit , & the necessity of full audit on mismatch. Above all we must have an Election commission that is accountable and works for ensuring voting rights of every Indian & not one that works to disenfranchise us. So rather than repeating facts like any technology is hackable , We need to talk about the current scenario of Indian Elections. ECI has not been doing any meaningful audit & has not yet carried out even its July 2017 decision of 5% audit . ECI EVM VVPAT manual doesnt even have a provision for full audit on mismatch, which is a basic & grave omission from ECI. Proper VVPAT audit with adequate sample size followed by full audit on any mismatch is essential part of voting right of every Indian. Without proper audit election results carry no credibility & are essentially invalid. Even if there was no evidence of EVM error/rigging till now , it is no excuse to evade proper audit in future elections which is a different event. (X and Y can be entirely different) In Telengana at least in 31 constituencies votes counted were significantly more than votes polled . This essentially means evms are prone to error/rigging. Either (error or rigging) proves conclusively ECI EVM results cant be depended on & We must ensure every vote counts. And even in this 31 constituencies in Telengana ECI didn’t do the minimum step of immediate full VVPAT audit, let alone stop the results. Clause 56(D)(2) of election rules which leaves decision to count (VVPATs on candidate’s request) to sole discretion of returning officer is gravely misused . It has made the right of candidate to ask for VVPAT tally essentially nonexistent. Paper Ballots are much preferred in front of a technology(EVM VVPAT) that can and has been made unaccountable. It is frightening to see how easily we can be blinded by favourable election results & media opinions . We must be hopeful , but should not fail to do our duty as citizens in ensuring the integrity of elections.

2019 Resolutions For Berlin’s Startup Scene,"German GmbH Challenges:,The debate at Techcrunch Disrupt Berlin had two main complaints:,Let’s take a closer look at GmbH Share Options Plan particulars:,Written by Tricia Levasseur,3 resolutions to kick-start 2019 in Berlin:,1. Be inspired, don’t just copy:,2. Stop competing on price:,3. Make business regulations more competitive:"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Tricia Levasseur Follow -- 1 Listen Share Looking forward to 2019, here are some potential new years resolutions Berlin’s startup scene could consider for increasing the ecosystem’s success over the next year as the UK prepares to Brexit and leaves Berlin as the EU’s largest startup hub. This isn’t a new piece of constructive criticism. Berlin appears to be fond of copying. It can be pretty shameless. Some startups make no attempt to evolve beyond something that already exists. Sure, in business it’s good to benchmark your competition. But what seems to go on in a few places around Berlin isn’t benchmarking, it is straight copying. I find this sad for a few reasons. Startup employees with genuine creativity who care about providing value to customers and shareholders feel like their internal flame is being slowly extinguished at a clone factory. It’s also not a good way to mentor young people just entering employment by teaching them that they shouldn’t think for themselves but instead switch-off their robust brains and just copy. What will these workers be like in 10-20 years time when they’ll most likely be needed to use their creative problem solving brains? And demonstrate true leadership skills? This just feels damaging for long-term career development. What happens when Germany’s workforce has a fat layer of mid and senior level managers who are only skilled at copying? On the other hand, buyers — including German consumers — deserve better than cheap knock-offs being pushed to try and position a startup for a quick high priced acquisition for founder paydays and investor profits. Copying will only make you as good as the one you’re copying *IF* you’re lucky. It will never make you better. And in today’s highly competitive marketplace creating a unique brand buyers fall in love with is necessary for long term success. I also wonder how Berlin will manage to outmanouver the largest startup hub in Europe, London, if it’s main startup driver happens to be cloned companies? London’s having a bit of a moment with Brexit, but people don’t actively sit around thinking about existing businesses they can copy and roll-out for fast money. But this absolutely happens in Berlin. All. The. Time. Further, here’s a U.S.example. Think about Facebook. It was not the first social network. MySpace and LinkedIn were already operational. However, Mark Zuckerberg didn’t sit around in his dorm at Harvard wondering how to clone MySpace. Instead he was inspired by the other nextworks and created something new with clear differentiating factors that people could really fall in love with. Since Facebook was different enough to become original — people did fall in love with it — and Facebook was able to scale globally. Copying what everyone else is doing also isn’t a long-term strategy for growing a sustainable economy. If all you want to do is create clones and sell into foreign companies as fast as possible — that’s not really setting the German economy up to have decades of rich global businesses driving it. Germany is still lucky to have a strong automotive industry but, with the way startups in Berlin are now, I’d worry about relying on the city’s copy-cat segement of startups to be the next generation of long-term German giants. Consumers fall in love with things that are original AND original can be scaled globally. Either be completely original or be inspired. Don’t just copy. This is an outdated and, in my opinion, unhelpful strategy that has roots in the City’s own marketing. Perhaps competing on price worked 15 years ago to get people back into Berlin. These days not only is it not exactly true, it sets the bar very low for the expectations of companies and founders coming to Berlin. Many who are enticed to come to Berlin by this marketing campaign, expect to pay the lowest price for everything including the people they hire. So, employees are faced with a rude reality when they’re offered salaries that are below the market rate. Further, if you stroll into any online expat forum, you’ll see there are always workers talking about how some jobs didn’t even pay at all. For the unlucky, they were greeted by the unofficial ‘Berlin Startup Welcome Package’ where they got hired, and then gave a big old brain-dump of intel into their new employer during the onboarding process only to be let-go just before actually reporting for their first shift. Sometimes the startup worker is cut even after having paid for their own relocation. Out of the startup employees who have paid for their own move and experience fast job loss, there’s a segement further that still never receives any conpensation for the work completed and costs incurred. Other times people struggle to get their last paycheck paid. Indeed, the word I see used most online to describe Berlin’s startup employment offering is ‘precarious’. While these shenanigans may be happening in other startup ecosystems, they simply aren’t talked about or documented at the rate that I see this happening in Berlin. Cruise into the expat forums and read for yourself. People with first-hand knowledge of the Berlin scene, regularly try to be a pal and drive newcomers to other cities in Germany where employment is more dependable. This reputation for Berlin as having ‘precarious employment’ is not good and can only be cleaned-up by following proper human resources policies and laws. For startups to be encouraged to stop exploiting talent, the City itself needs to care and actually enforce rules and regulations on the employers who are violating the norms. For that to happen, Berlin needs to stop marketing itself as the cheapest option going because people tend to not respect things when they’re operating on a race to the bottom. And Berlin isn’t cheap anymore — something that’s sparked several protests recently. For those that haven’t heard, housing is in short supply across Germany’s major cities meanwhile prices are at an all-time high. Many expats complain about the ruthlessness of house hunting. Their stories contain the same shenanigans from Berlin to Munich. “Expat forums are filled with tips, and an English-speaker advised newcomers to submit CVs, pay slips, credit histories and references to potential landlords. Apartment hunters often wind up starting jobs while they urgently hunt for a home in the evenings. They sleep on friends’ couches, mull bribes and swap stories of scams.” — Allision Williams, Handlesblatt Global It’s common knowledge that having people living in your city is a good thing. Workers spend their wages locally on things like rent, food, transportation, and entertainment. But it isn’t good enough to just take money from people without providing a lawful environment for them to live and work anymore. All business schools teach the dangers of competing on cost. Berlin is not an undesirable city trying to regenerate. It is a nation’s capital and the second largest city in Europe. And the business policy makers need to start behaving like that. After updating the city’s strategy to not attract business by competing as the cheapest option going, leaders need to improve business regulations to make things more accessible and inclusive. Now let’s take a step back to understand where things are today. Berlin entered the 20th century as a global powerhouse for technology and banking. For example, Siemens built and operated the first telegraph from Europe to the United States from Berlin. At the same time that Berlin was creating world changing technological innovations, the city was also home to many international banks. But then the World Wars happened and brought very dark times. Afterwards Berlin was left destroyed, de-industrialized, and divided. As a result, all the big companies and banks moved away, and new companies avoided the very complicated situation Berlin had. Even when reunification happened in 1990, Berlin had some major challenges. Officials needed to reunite a collapsed socialistic planned economy with low productivity and few competitive products on the Eastern side with a highly subsidized economy on the Western side. As a result of reunification, there was a lot of pressure to find new ways to develop and move Berlin’s unified economy forward. During the decades since reunification, Berlin’s changed. It has become one of the leading digital hotspots for Europe. It also holds a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem. Berlin’s startup scene is the largest within the Eurozone and the second largest in the European Union only behind London. Government officials state that every 20 hours a startup is founded within its technology sector. And if the UK completes the Brexit process, Berlin will become the largest startup ecosystem within the European Union too. But all this incredible growth isn’t coming without highlighting additional challenges. With the attraction and creation of new businesses, the city’s population has grown rapidly over the last 10 years. Housing in Berlin is under pressure as already mentioned — there were no shortage of news headlines about this throughout 2018. This means politicians need to consider how to foster economic growth while continuing to provide a high quality of living. In my opinion, it also means they need to consider looking at their business registration processes and employment regulation. In Germany the main company form that startups choose is also the most widespread type of company formation in Germany, the Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung or “GmbH”, which translated literally, means a ‘company with limited liability’. For comparision, in the UK the main company form startups tend to choose is the LTD or limited liability company. As far as European businesses go, both the Germany GmbH and the UK LTD (registered in England and Wales) offer strong international confidence due to the high operational standards applied by the German and British regulators and the established legal framework in both Germany and England. However, while in Germany having limited liability is ideal for entrepreneurs who want to protect their private assets while projecting a public image of legitimacy to their customers and business partners, the GmbH often presents challenges for founders that ultimately make it less attractive than some other country’s limited liability formations. While some might be thinking “this is great, I know any German company I’m doing business with has a solid foundation!” there are other areas that are holding German GmbHs back. At the recently held TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin, I attended a panel discussion that addressed fundraising for German startups. One of the biggest hurdles identified was the fact it is so unattractive to issue employee shares from a GmbH. It was felt by panellists that this needed to be addressed by authorities as a matter of urgency to make German businesses even more competitive. According to the hosts of the session I attended, the law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP; “employee share plans [in Germany] incentivize, motivate and retain management board members and executive employees, and consequently increase the company’s productivity, but are also seen as a capital investment tool in the current low-interest phase. Compared to other European countries, the total number of participants in employee share plan participants in Germany is relatively small. One key reason is that employee share plans do not provide significant tax benefits under German tax laws (for example, in comparison to Austrian or UK laws).” And finally, it is legal for GbmH’s to offer shares conditionally — meaning they are only exercisable if an employee hits performance targets or time-based vested conditions are met. For clarity, the law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP explains; “the benefit derived from the exercise of share options is generally subject to income taxes and taxed as employment income. The taxable benefit is also subject to a solidarity surcharge and to church tax (if applicable). The taxable benefit is the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the shares at the date of exercise (that is, the date when the shares are recorded in the employee’s account). The benefit is added to the employee’s taxable income and subject to the employee’s individual progressive income tax rate. The highest marginal income tax rate in 2017 is 45%, plus a 5.5% solidarity surcharge levied on the income tax. The church tax rate (if applicable) depends on the religious community and the federal state to which the employee belongs. The taxable benefit is also subject to social security contributions (different rates apply to pension, unemployment and healthcare insurance). Social security contributions are, however, capped, so that no additional contributions are levied if the total employment income exceeds a certain level per year. The employer and the employee are each liable for half of the contributions.” Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP further details regulations for employees selling their shares; “on the disposal of shares acquired on exercise of an option, the capital gain is subject to (privileged) capital gains tax at a flat rate of 25% (plus a 5.5% solidarity surcharge and church tax, if any) provided that the shares were placed in the employee’s account after 31 December 2008. If the shares comprise 1% or more of the company’s total share capital, the employee’s individual income tax rate applies. In this case, 40% of the capital gains are tax-exempt. The taxable capital gain is the difference between the acquisition cost (that is, the fair market value of the shares at the date of exercise) and the sale price. If the capital gain from the disposal of shares is paid out or credited by a German financial services institution (or an equivalent institution), withholding taxes must generally be deducted by that institution and paid to the tax authorities. Generally, the tax deduction is final (Abgeltungsteuer). However, on application by the employee, the individual income tax rate can be applied if it is more beneficial to the employee. If no German financial services institution is involved, the employee must declare the capital gain in his or her personal annual income tax return.” There’s no question that Berlin is a dynamic and vibrant city. The quality of life is good compared to many other cities of its size. But if Berlin’s startup ecosystem wants to really soar in 2019, adjusting its attitude towards copying other businesses, not competing as the cheapest option going, and making its regulatory approach to issuing employee shares more competitive will help the city’s startups achieve even greater success.

The VC-Backed Startup Solving Education,"Optimised learning, powered by AI and cognitive science,Guaranteed results or money back,Fighting inequality,The end of exams,Investing in education,This story is published in The Startup, Medium’s largest entrepreneurship publication followed by +405,714 people.,Subscribe to receive our top stories here.,Written by Miruna Girtu"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Miruna Girtu Follow The Startup -- Listen Share The challenge of education is complex. How can the knowledge and skills of an expert be deconstructed into a format that can be understood by a novice, and then built up in a way that transforms the novice into an expert? How to ensure genuine retained understanding, memory, ability and transferrable intelligence? And how to do it at scale? “This is only possible by combining effective instruction (teaching), cognitive science and neuroscience, and technology (artificial intelligence) — in one solution,” summarizes Guy Riese, Forbes 30 under 30, CEO and CoFounder of Up Learn. “If you take just one of those you can have a good product. If you take two, it can be great. If you take all three and do it right, you solve education.” It all started when Riese fell ill at the beginning of his A Levels and missed an entire term. Keen not to move down a year, he searched the internet for ways to catch up and came across research on effective learning in the field of cognitive science. He applied these insights to his studies and rose from below average grades to top of his year in Maths, Chemistry, and Physics. He went on to achieve straight A*s, scoring 100% in Physics and secured a place at Imperial College London to study Mechanical Engineering. Riese then graduated with 1st Class Honours and a dissertation on Machine Learning. “The secret to my success, and why some students get A*s, whilst others get Cs and Ds, has not been because of what I’ve learnt, it’s been how.” I founded Up Learn to create a system for making the most effective learning experience in the world accessible to all”. Up Learn is building a product that delivers education success at scale, starting with A Levels. It consolidates thousands of learning resources in one system. The content created by Up Learn teachers is fuelled by research into cognitive science, which ensures its efficiency and efficacy. As a student starts going through the content, Up Learn’s AI continuously analyses their strengths, weaknesses, and behaviour at a granular level, and uses the insights to direct them to the most important lesson, quiz or activity for them to do next, until they reach 90% in every topic. Throughout the process, students have access to live on-demand tutoring and to videos that simulate real-life lessons. To support the latter, Up Learn has built its own animation capability that produces high-quality videos at low cost and is open for other businesses to use. Over the past two years, 97% of the students who completed Up Learn courses have achieved A*–A grades. Confident in the effectiveness of its proprietary approach, Up Learn guarantees that its students will achieve an A-A* grade upon completion of its online course, or their money back — a potentially risky decision for a business that caters to thousands of different types of students. “This is a widespread misconception throughout society when thinking about intelligence and education. If I asked you, how could you possibly know that an antibiotic is going to kill bacteria in everyone? What would you say? Science. These treatments are studied against controls to determine how effective they are. And some treatments can get very close to 100%,” Riese explains. “It can work just the same for education. We use scientific methods to study the effectiveness of our education treatments. And that’s how we can get such results with certainty and guarantee outcomes at scale.” The uncomfortable truth is that, according to an Annual Report published by the Education Policy Institute in the U.K., by the end of primary school, children from low-income families are 9.4 months behind on average — a gap that grows to 18.4 months by the time they leave secondary education. Up Learn is not free to use — it charges per school year per subject. Riese is aware that not everyone will be able to afford it and has a solution. “Making the most effective education solution only available to those who can afford it would only worsen the existing inequality in education and further reduce social mobility. For that reason, we have set a goal — for every student who pays for Up Learn, we provide a course free to a student who can’t. We offer an unlimited number of free scholarships to students who meet one of our set criteria. Last year, about 25% of the students enrolled in Up Learn were on these scholarships — something we are very proud of.” Up Learn’s mission is to solve education as a whole. “For example, in the future, Up Learn could deliver the entire curriculum learning and assessment component of education. It’s unnecessary for students to sit the actual exam — we have already determined their grade. Students currently might take a two-hour exam, once a year. Instead, we collect over a hundred hours of learning and assessment data, continuously. Once the student reaches A* level, we could, in theory, issue their grade. Without an exam and without any stress. It becomes about completing the learning — actually having the knowledge and skills — instead of how you perform on a specific day with specific questions. ” Reflecting both the existing challenges and the opportunities in the EdTech space, investment activity is at an all-time high, with international funding reaching a new record of $10.58 Billion in investment in the first three quarters of 2018. The EdTech market is projected to grow at 17.0% per annum, to $252 Billion by 2020. Riese started the company with personal funds, selling his first company when still at university, along with a Young Innovators award from CVC Capital Partners. It was then bootstrapped from there to first revenue. Up Learn has since raised over $3 Million in seed funding, investors including Forward Partners, SyndicateRoom’s Growth Fund and a number of high profile private investors. Luke Smith, Investor at Forward Partners comments “In a world where the majority of new jobs being created require high skill levels, education is increasingly important in our shared success. And as a parent of young children, I’ve experienced the appetite to invest in my children’s future first hand. But tech’s impact on education has been more limited than you might expect. Over the past few years, the use of AI and technologies like personalised learning have received a lot of attention (and VC funding) but adoption has been slow. Equally, many of these businesses have struggled to gain momentum due to long, careful sales cycles from the educational institutions. Against this background, we’re delighted to reveal our investment in a company that we think will transform education by avoiding some of these pitfalls, and quickly bring better educational outcomes to the masses.” Read more about Forward’s investment into Up Learn here. The typical strategy in education is focusing on just one specific component. Under this scenario, Riese believes that solving education would only be possible if every company and organisation solving the individual components collaborated and connected with an unprecedented level of transparency and perfect cohesion. He sees that as an unlikely outcome. “The only way to tackle the entire challenge of education is by doing a number of different things — all the components of it — and doing them really well. This is hard, but ultimately the most valuable problem to be solving.” This ambitious goal can still be highly focused. “We’re not trying to build 100 different features; we’re trying to build the one feature that solves 100 different problems.” Up Learn is driven by a belief that a complete and effective solution will lead to a future where every motivated student succeeds, qualifications are earned in less time and people are better equipped to contribute to a growing economy. -- -- The Startup Start-ups and VC 🌱 Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:6417/1*d3yeiKwUgvQLvEX6SOPGSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*Xx0u_tCqtMojNWDn4NElMQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*pKOfOAOvx-fWzfITATgGRg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*YqDjlKFwScoQYQ62DWEdig.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*ouK9XR4xuNWtCes-TIUNAw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*Xx0u_tCqtMojNWDn4NElMQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*pKOfOAOvx-fWzfITATgGRg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*9JA4P_vko_S4M0UeCJcoEQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Xx0u_tCqtMojNWDn4NElMQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*GONEhoJPJwk7-jY8-lMFYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*N8TdqQwDYdqXCAfZT-YcUw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*e7DwWGogXjkGhoFZ', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*3SnjX10GOMz5v6E9cXuZ5Q@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*lYYpfbgtZ1JKrPX82zEo9Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Xx0u_tCqtMojNWDn4NElMQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*TQlEMeYwwWc38Wqm7EfCTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*0-N4JrXpZG1KJfIrAutd3A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*iQJjezE8PMsrLMJyhgmWDA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*SSldMA8f2cLiwAZDfFFwVA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*v81PL_0CTnry3iWQHBAKpQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*Ans6sKAILtR_3JrzUVH-5A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*2s48FXT-YXuen8EdcpUWog.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*7-Vd2V6yvsrRROavIg5RFg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*APAhA_gTOYKgQmIQ6RnR0w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*jMk3fbTsmaloN_0gWguClA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@MirunaGirtu?source=post_page-----17da5cf5201f--------------------------------,90,6 min read
"All Tech Projects run over budget, change our mind.","Why you should triple your budget,Feasibility,The Client,Technical Debt,AI: the silver bullet to stop Technical Debt from sucking you dry,How much does it cost to make an app? - App Cost Calculator,Written by Wendy Dean,Why do they run over budget?,What can we do to stop them from running over budget?"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Wendy Dean Follow pushtostart -- 2 Listen Share When I first started out in the tech industry, my first boss gave me a nice tip. “Whatever they quote you… triple it.” At the time I thought he was insane. Triple it?! Sure I knew that sometimes projects run a little over budget, but triple? I was young, incredulous, and naive — in my own arrogance, I ignored his advice. Two months later, I was sitting across from him in our executive conference room. Had I experienced insane success and been promoted to an executive position, all in 2 months? No, I had horribly failed as the project I was working on ran more than 3 times over the budget, with no end in sight. I was thankful to still have my job, and passing off the project to my boss so he could cover our losses. At the time, I learned two lessons. First, that I should take advice from industry veterans. And second, that all tech projects run over budget. In my experience there are usually three core reasons why projects run over budget: feasibility, failure to account for issues related to development, and technical debt. This is the issue most often plaguing software development. It starts the same everytime — you meet with other members, they quote you the time and cost they think it will take to finish it. The main issue here is that, usually, they quote based on how fast the project would go without being bogged down by reviews, changes, and technical debt (more on this later). To make things worse, you’ll then go to management, who will halve all estimates. You’ll argue that this much isn’t feasible, but they’ll say some buzzwords (most notably “agile” and “sprint”) and shoo you out. Then you meet with marketing, which was supposed to meet with the software engineers last week but didn’t. They’ll ask a bunch of conceptual questions that border on philosophical — “not what is the product, why is the product?” — and you walk out a little confused, but confident in branding. But tonight one of them will have an amazing new, innovative idea for how to position the product — and in a week they’ll be pushing something that isn’t even on the roadmap. Another obvious issue lies in accounting for issues related to development, especially unseen ones. How do you account for the unforeseeable? As a rule of thumb, every time you think something might go wrong, assume it will. In software, something will ALWAYS go wrong. My developers have a running joke with a calendar on the wall: “days since bug.” That number never has and never will exceed 0. And then of course, there’s the client. The client comes to you with an idea — they know what they want and need you to make it. For those of you industry veterans that just did a double take on that last line, don’t worry, I was just kidding! The client absolutely doesn’t know what they want. There will be a dozen changes to the spec, several pivots and new features, and complaints when you build what they asked for but it doesn’t look as good in real life as it did in their head. And then there’s technical debt. What is Technical Debt and what forms does it take? Well, in general, Technical Debt arises from rushed projects and issues related to development. According to Techopedia: Technical debt is a concept in programming that reflects the extra development work that arises when code that is easy to implement in the short run is used instead of applying the best overall solution. For all you software devs, this will sound very familiar. It’s the cost that arises from when you run npm install xyz and the developer behind it stops updating xyz. It’s the cost that arises when you write that one-liner at 4pm on a Friday and knock the ball out of the park, but it starts slowing down the app and increasing server load above 10 users. For more on Technical Debt, there’s a nice piece by Tomer Dicturel explaining where we are and where we’re going that has been trending for the past few weeks on Medium: towardsdatascience.com This is more of an open-ended question. Every project is different and, to some extent, requires its own special solution. In general though, I’ve found that properly allocating a budget that takes into account failure will save you hundreds of thousands of dollars down the road in frantic panic. Next time you get quoted $8000 and 7 days to build your app, stop and think: is this an accurate estimate? Rome wasn’t built in a day, nor was it built in a week for a couple grand — your app will most likely cost multiples of that quote, and you should expect that. We found that most projects quoted at lower estimates (usually by freelancers) run over budget and never get completed — that’s an 88% non-completion rate. So we collected more data — data on successful projects, that were completed and reached some level of success. We found that most projects hit a cost (not a budget — we took into account the final cost) between $160k and $180k. At first thought this may seem insanely high, but these are the costs associated with developing long-term, sustainable tech. To make your life a little easier, we built out a calculator too — one that’ll properly budget your app for success.

[USCF 시리즈 (4/4)] vvisp을 통해 DApp 업그레이드하기,"Make your DApp Upgradeable with vvisp,Cyclic Dependency,Deployment Resuming,Registry 컨트랙트 내의 배포 정보,HAECHI-LABS/vvisp,Written by Jihyeok Choy,Upgradeable Smart Contract Framework의 진입 장벽,DApp 프로젝트 생성,DApp 배포,DApp 업그레이드,추가적인 주요 기능,마무리하며"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Jihyeok Choy Follow HAECHI AUDIT -- Share 블록체인 기술 전문 기업 ‘해치랩스(HAECHI LABS)’에서 업그레이드 가능한 스마트 컨트랙트 프레임워크에 대한 글을 연재합니다. 지난 3편까지 Upgradeable Smart Contract에 대한 선행 연구들과 배경지식을 살펴보았으며 HAECHI LABS에서 설계한 Upgradeable Smart Contract Framework에 대해 알아보았습니다. 먼저, 1. 배포 후 발견된 버그를 수정할 수 있다는 점, 2. DApp이 비즈니스 로직을 업데이트할 수 있다는 점, 두 가지 이유를 통해 스마트 컨트랙트의 ‘Upgradeability(업그레이드 가능성)’의 필요성에 대해 논의한 후, Upgradeable Smart Contract Framework가 만족시켜야 할 조건들과 Storage, Function Call 그리고 DelegateCall의 배경지식을 살펴보았습니다. 이후, Proxy와 Registry를 이용한 Upgradeable Smart Contract Framework를 설명했습니다. Upgradeable Smart Contract Framework(이하 USCF)을 이용하면, Atomic한 업그레이드와 동일한 Entry point를 통해 DApp 서비스의 질을 크게 향상시킬 수 있습니다. 하지만 여전히 서비스 운영에 있어 개발자의 어려움이 남아 있습니다. 업그레이드 가능한 서비스를 운영하기 위해서는 개발자가 USCF에 대한 모든 배경 지식을 알고 있어야 한다는 점입니다. 실제 서비스는 여러 컨트랙트들로 이루어져 있는 경우가 대부분이기 때문에 모든 컨트랙트들과 각 컨트랙트들에 해당하는 Proxy 컨트랙트들을 일일이 관리해야 하며, 배포 단계에서 배포와 업그레이드 함수 호출의 순서를 알고 있어야 합니다. 이러한 프레임워크에 대한 배경지식들은 진입 장벽이 되어 개발 속도를 현저히 떨어뜨립니다. 그렇다면 기존에 존재하던 여러 프레임워크들은 어떤 방식을 취하고 있을까요? 프레임워크는 그들만의 도구가 존재합니다. 가깝게는 스마트 컨트랙트 테스트시 사용하는 Truffle Framework를 살펴볼 수 있습니다. Truffle Framework는 자바스크립트 테스트 도구인 mocha를 사용하여 스마트 컨트랙트 테스팅 방법론을 제시합니다. 기존에 많이 쓰이는 mocha의 형태를 따라가기 때문에 직관적인 장점이 있지만, 스마트 컨트랙트를 테스팅 하기 위해서는 여러 전처리 작업이 필요합니다. 컴파일, 배포, 블록체인과 연결, 주소 저장 등의 작업은 필수적이지만 매 테스트 시 설정하기에는 상당히 번거롭습니다. 이를 위해, Truffle Framework는 truffle cli tool를 함께 제공하여 전처리 작업을 자동화합니다. 사실상 이 도구가 없으면 이 Framework를 사용하기에 많은 제약이 있다고 할 수 있습니다. 프론트엔드 개발자들에게 친숙한 React 역시 그를 위한 도구가 있습니다. React는 프론트엔드에서 UI(User Interface)를 만들기 위한 자바스크립트 프레임워크 중 하나입니다. 효과적인 환경을 제공하기에 최근 많은 인기를 얻고 있지만 React를 사용하기 위해 필요한 환경설정은 상당히 복잡합니다. 많은 라이브러리들이 필요하며, 독자적인 설정 파일과 파일 구조를 가지고 있어, 수동으로 설정하기에는 시간이 꽤 소요됩니다. 이를 위해, 이러한 개발 환경을 자동으로 만들어주는 create-react-app이란 도구가 존재합니다. create-react-app에서는 명령어 한줄로 즉시 개발과 테스팅이 가능한 환경을 만들어주기 때문에 개발자가 React 프레임워크에 빠르게 적응하게 도와줍니다. 이처럼, 개발자에게 하여금 많은 학습시간을 필요로 하는 프레임워크에는 이들을 쉽게 사용하게끔 도와주는 도구가 대부분 존재합니다. USCF도 앞선 포스팅에서 설명드린 배경지식 없이는 이용하기 어렵습니다. HAECHI LABS는 이러한 지식 없이도 손쉽게 업그레이드 가능한 스마트 컨트랙트를 구현하고 배포하기 위해 vvisp이라는 툴을 개발하였습니다. vvisp은 아래와 같은 배경지식이 없어도 쉽게 이용할 수 있습니다. 위와 같은 이해가 부족한 상태에서 vvisp 없이 개발을 한다면 컨트랙트를 잘못 작성하거나, 함수 호출 순서를 잘못 부르거나, 잘못된 인자를 넘겨주는 등 실수할 여지가 많습니다. 경제적 가치를 지니는 암호화폐가 유통되는 DApp이라면 이러한 실수가 치명적인 결과를 초래할 수도 있습니다. 따라서 vvisp은 개발자가 USCF에 대한 이해가 부족하더라도 실수하지 않고 편하고 빠르게 배포할 수 있도록 돕습니다. vvisp이 제공하는 기능은 다음과 같습니다. 이제, 샘플 앱을 통해 이 작업이 어떻게 이루어지는지 살펴보도록 하겠습니다. 간단한 DApp 프로젝트를 위해 새로운 디렉토리를 하나 생성합니다. 해당 디렉토리에서 프로젝트를 시작하기 위해 vvisp을 설치합니다. 혹은 이제 생성한 디렉토리에서 샘플 DApp 프로젝트를 시작합니다. 해당 안내와 함께 프로젝트를 위한 환경이 만들어집니다. 컨트랙트 테스트를 위한 truffle의 디렉토리 구조를 지원하여 보다 손쉽게 두 도구를 모두 이용할 수 있습니다. 또한, HAECHI LABS에서 코드 감사를 위해 사용하는 스크립트와 여러 유용한 라이브러리가 함께 있어 프로젝트 bootstrapping을 빠르게 할 수 있습니다. 이제 해당 디렉토리의 contracts/폴더 내에서 샘플 DApp 컨트랙트를 생성합니다. 해당 DApp은 크게 두 가지 컨트랙트로 이루어져 있습니다. 사용자는 Haechi라는 가상의 펫을 키울 수 있습니다. HaechiV1 컨트랙트에서는 Haechi의 소유권과 각 Haechi의 능력치에 대해 구현되어 있습니다. 가상의 달리기 시합을 한다고 할때, 사용자는 HaechiV1.sol의 run 함수를 불러 Haechi를 달리게 할 수 있습니다. 이때, Haechi의 빠르기 velocity는 Haechi의 고유 능력치이며, 이를 HaechiGym.sol에서 ‘강화’할 수 있습니다. 간단한 DApp이지만 이를 업그레이드 가능하도록 배포하기 위해서는 앞서 이야기한 장벽이 존재합니다. 이제 vvisp을 통해 이를 어떻게 단순화하였는지 살펴보겠습니다. 배포에 앞서 vvisp 프로젝트는 사용할 네트워크와 계정의 설정이 필요합니다. 생성된 프로젝트 내의 .env 파일에서 몇 가지 환경 변수를 설정합니다. 현재 입력된 정보는 local:8545에 연결된 노드에서 MNEMONIC의 첫 번째 계좌로부터 10Gwei로 트랜잭션을 발생시키겠다는 뜻입니다. 해당 .env 파일의 작성이 끝나면 이제 본격적인 배포를 시작합니다. * 기본적으로 vvisp의 컨셉은 Terraform을 참고하였습니다. 참고: 기존에 클라우드 인프라(AWS 등)를 수동으로 배포할 경우, 설정 등 일관성이 깨져 매번 다른 인프라가 배포될 수 있습니다. Terraform과 같은 IaaC(Infrastructure as a Code) 툴은 인프라 배포 과정을 코드로 일관성과 가독성 있게 관리하는 데 도움을 주는 도구입니다. Terraform은 인프라 배포를 위한 설정 파일을 작성하게 하여 일관성과 가독성을 제공합니다. Terraform과 비슷하게 vvisp 역시 서비스 배포를 위해서는 컨트랙트들의 정보를 기록한 배포 설정 파일, service.vvisp.json이 필요합니다. 이 파일에 배포 정보를 어떻게 기록하는지 살펴보도록 하겠습니다. 만약 토큰 컨트랙트와 같이 쉽게 변경이 가능하면 위험성이 커져 upgradeability를 배제하고 싶은 컨트랙트(이하 nonUpgradeable Contract) 역시 서비스에 포함시킬 수 있습니다. 이 경우 upgradeable 속성을 비워두거나 false로 두어 아래와 같이 작성하면 됩니다. * vvisp이 truffle과 비교하여 어떤 점이 다른가요?vvisp은 truffle과 달리 스마트 컨트랙트 업그레이드를 지원한다는 것 외에도 배포 설정 파일 service.vvisp.json을 작성하는 방식을 채택했다는 점이 특징입니다.명시적인 별도의 파일을 작성한 후 이를 통해 배포하는 방법은 커맨드 라인과의 대화형 질문을 통해 배포하는 방법에 비해 실수할 여지가 적으며 같은 상황을 재현하기 쉽습니다. truffle의 경우 개발자에게 script를 작성하여 배포하도록 합니다. 이 방법은 자유도는 높지만, 모든 컨트랙트의 내용과 배포 순서를 모두 염두한 채로 script를 작성해야 하기 때문에 복잡합니다. vvisp이 지원하는 json 형식의 배포 설정 파일은 간편할 뿐 아니라, 개발자/비개발자 모두 한 눈에 알기 쉬운 형태로 표현되어 있어 가독성 측면에서도 장점을 가지고 있습니다. 배포 설정 파일 service.vvisp.json의 작성이 끝난 후, 다음과 같이 해당 서비스를 배포할 수 있습니다. DApp의 첫 배포가 끝나면 자동으로 state.vvisp.json이 생성됩니다. state.vvisp.json은 배포된 서비스와 이를 구성하는 컨트랙트들의 정보를 보여주는 파일입니다. 다음과 같은 항목이 기입됩니다. 해당 파일에 기록되는 정보는 Registry 컨트랙트에도 저장되어 있기 때문에, 만약 state.vvisp.json 파일이 변경/삭제되어도 Registry 컨트랙트에 기록된 정보를 토대로 언제든 복구가 가능합니다. (추후 Registry 컨트랙트를 바탕으로 자동으로 state.vvisp.json을 복구하는 기능 또한 추가할 예정입니다.) 이제 앞서 생성한 샘플 DApp을 vvsip으로 업그레이드하는 과정을 살펴보겠습니다. HaechiV1에서 Haechi는 달리기를 할 수 있었다면, 이제 날 수 있도록 업그레이드하려고 합니다. 개발자는 다음과 같은 두 가지 절차를 따릅니다. 1. 이전 버전 컨트랙트인 HaechiV1.sol을 상속받은 HaechiV2.sol을 생성한 후 변경할 로직을 작성 2. 배포 설정 파일 state.vvisp.json의 contracts/Haechi를 다음과 같이 변경 위 과정에서 개발자는 변경할 비즈니스 로직과 배포 정보 이외에는 신경쓰지 않아도 되며 간단하게 업그레이드를 준비할 수 있습니다. 이제 $vvisp deploy-service를 통해 다음 버전으로 서비스를 업그레이드 합니다. 배포가 끝나면 변경사항이 state.vvisp.json에 저장됩니다. 업그레이드를 실행했던 Haechi의 fileName과 address가 바뀐 것을 알 수 있습니다. Proxy 컨트랙트의 주소는 바뀌지 않았기 때문에 서비스는 유저에게 동일한 Entry point를 제공할 수 있습니다. 앞에서는 언급되지 않았지만 vvisp의 deploy-service에는 몇 가지 주요 기능들이 더 있습니다. 스마트 컨트랙트의 생성자에 다른 컨트랙트의 address를 인자로 넘겨주는 것은 흔한 패턴입니다. 특히, 여러 컨트랙트가 얽혀 있는 DApp의 경우, 한 컨트랙트가 많은 컨트랙트의 주소를 참조하고 있을 수 있습니다. 위 코드는 ContractA가 ContractB의 address를 생성자에서 참조하고 있는 코드입니다. 이 때 컨트랙트가 배포되기 전까진 해당 컨트랙트의 주소를 알 수 없습니다. 따라서 ContractB가 ContractA보다 먼저 배포되어야 합니다. 그런데 아래와 같이 ContractB도 반대로 ContractA를 참조하고 있다면, 즉 서로가 서로를 참조하고 있다면, 컨트랙트 배포 순서를 정할 수 없게 됩니다. 따라서 두 컨트랙트를 모두 배포할 때, 먼저 배포되는 컨트랙트에는 올바른 인자를 전달할 수 없습니다. 이를 Cyclic Dependency가 존재하는 상황이라고 합니다. 컨트랙트 수가 3개라면, A가 B를, B가 C를, C가 A를 참조하게 될 경우 Cyclic Dependency가 형성됩니다. 이는 사실상 잘못된 설계이며 올바른 배포가 일어나지 않습니다. 따라서, vvisp은 배포 전 이를 자동으로 확인하는 과정을 거치며, 만약 Cyclic Dependency가 존재할 경우 배포를 시작하지 않습니다. Cyclic Dependency가 발견되지 않는다면, vvisp은 컨트랙트들 간의 dependency 순서도(DAG)를 만들고 그 순서대로 자동 배포하여 컨트랙트의 주소를 올바르게 전달합니다. 참고: 위 사항은 업그레이드 가능한 컨트랙트에 대해서는 적용되지 않습니다. 업그레이드 가능한 컨트랙트는 미리 모든 컨트랙트들을 배포한 후 연결 작업만 시행하기 때문에, 주소가 모두 공개되어 있어 Cyclic Dependency를 고려하지 않아도 됩니다. vvisp이 DApp 서비스를 배포할 때에는 여러 트랜잭션을 순서대로 발생하게 됩니다. 이 때, 갑작스럽게 네트워크/노드에 장애가 일어나거나 다른 클라이언트에서 같은 주소로 동시에 트랜잭션을 날려 nonce가 겹치는 문제가 발생할 수 있습니다. 이 경우, 배포를 진행중이던 vvisp은 작업을 중단하게 됩니다. 생각보다 이러한 문제는 자주 발생합니다. 그런데 이 때마다 처음부터 다시 배포한다면 시간도 오래 소요될 뿐더러 많은 양의 가스를 소모하게 됩니다. 따라서 도중에 배포가 중단되었다면 중단된 곳부터 다시 재시작하는 기능이 꼭 필요합니다. 재시작을 위해서는 중단된 시점과 중간 상태에 대한 정보가 필요합니다. 즉, 서비스의 현 상태에 대해 저장된 정보가 필요합니다. vvisp에서는 이를 간단한 State Machine을 도입하여 구현하였습니다. $vvisp deploy-service는 아래 순서대로 트랜잭션을 발생시킵니다. 만약 배포 도중 어떤 문제상황이 발생하여 배포가 중단되었다면 아래와 같은 메시지를 출력합니다. 이 때, 중간 상태에 대한 정보가 state.vvisp.json에 기록됩니다. 이는 Token 컨트랙트의 Proxy 컨트랙트를 배포하던 중 중단되었다는 뜻으로, 해당 정보 이외에도 많은 중간 상태들이 파일에 기록되어 있습니다. 이 때, 안내된 메시지와 같이 $vvisp deploy-service를 재입력하면 중단되었던 곳부터 배포를 재시작할 수 있습니다. state.vvisp.json을 통해 배포 정보를 보여주는 것은 가시적이며 간단합니다. 그러나 불가변성이라는 장점을 지닌 블록체인을 두고 local file에만 의존하는 것은 중요한 기능을 놓치고 있는 것이라 생각합니다. 그래서 배포된 contract의 정보들(file 이름 등)을 Registry 컨트랙트에 쓰는 형태를 택하여, state.vvisp.json 뿐만 아니라 Registry 컨트랙트 내에도 모든 정보를 보관할 수 있도록 하였습니다. 현재 버전(v0.1.9)의 vvisp에서는 Registry에 기록을 저장하는 기능까지만 구현되어 있습니다. 추후에는 배포 전 Registry 컨트랙트의 정보를 읽어 현재 local file(state.vvisp.json)이 최신인지 여부를 판단하는 기능과 해당 정보를 통해 state.vvisp.json을 복구하는 기능도 추가할 예정입니다. 지금까지 vvisp의 메인 기능인 deploy-service에 대해 살펴보았습니다. 이외에도 vvisp은 스마트 컨트랙트 개발을 도와주는 다양한 기능들을 지원하고 있습니다. 자세한 사항은 아래 vvisp github을 참고하시기 바랍니다. :) github.com Facebook을 비롯한 오늘날의 서비스들은 한 달에도 서너 번의 업데이트를 진행하며 서비스의 품질을 향상시키고 있습니다. 만약, 어떠한 서비스가 업그레이드를 하지 않아 시장의 변화와 이용자의 니즈를 반영하지 못한다면 그 서비스는 도태되고 말 것입니다. 스마트 컨트랙트를 이용한 DApp 서비스도 예외는 아닙니다. 그러나 스마트 컨트랙트 위에서 Upgradeability를 구현하기란 쉽지 않습니다. 앞서 언급드린 Proxy와 Registry의 개념, 스마트 컨트랙트의 storage 구조 등을 모두 이해하고 있어야 하며 업그레이드를 어떻게 진행해야하는지에 대한 과정 역시 개발자가 숙지하고 있어야 합니다. HAECHI LABS에서 개발한 Upgradeable Smart Contract Framework(vvisp)은 이러한 작업을 간소화하였습니다. 필요한 컨트랙트 라이브러리를 지원하고, 단 한 줄의 명령어로 배포를 자동 실행해주어 개발자가 실제 서비스에 필요한 Business 로직 개발에만 집중할 수 있는 환경을 제공하고 있습니다. HAECHI LABS는 블록체인이 정말 세상을 바꿀 만한 기술임을 입증하기 위해서는 훌륭한 적용 사례가 등장해야 한다고 믿습니다. 또한 이를 위해서, 많은 개발자/회사들이 쉽고 편리하게 블록체인 서비스를 만들 수 있어야 한다고 생각합니다.

(c.f. What triggered you?).,How did you raise the money necessary to launch your business? (e.g. Did you find an investor? Did you borrow from the bank? Did you save money by working a 9 to 5? Please tell us your story.).,What was the most difficult thing you faced when you first started your business?,What advice do you have for newly arrived immigrants that want to pursue the path of entrepreneurship?,Written by Amine Rahal"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Amine Rahal Follow -- Listen Share Martin Basiri, ApplyBoard, Co-founder and CEO. I came to the U.S. from Iran. I decided to immigrate primarily because I was seeking a better higher education, and Canada and the U.S. is known to have some of the best schools in the world. In addition to education, like many, I chose to immigrate because I wanted to explore opportunities; to unleash my potential where it counts. As an immigrant, there are many challenges you face. Paperwork processes were one of them, as it was hard to understand what needed to get done and when. However, the number one challenge I faced when I arrived in the U.S. was language. The ability to communicate in words and understand gestures used in daily conversations — you can’t just translate words directly. There’s more to it. All countries have slang and that’s not just something you learn in class or through a podcast. It’s something you learn when engaging with locals. To add to this, understanding the thought process behind the language and gestures; the psychology. Why people say certain things, what people want to hear, etc. Becoming an entrepreneur wasn’t my first thought, nor was it my second or third. I just always had a passion for building things. Since early childhood, I was building things. I always wanted to be in a competitive space and to do something that challenged me and allowed me to further develop my skills. The harder the task was, the more exciting it became to me. Having said that, I became an entrepreneur as a result of my personal experiences. When I set out to study abroad and immigrate to another country, I faced a long list of obstacles. From obtaining the right information about schools and programs to applying for a visa, it was hard. Through this experience, I recognized there is a huge lack of product and software services in this particular area (EdTech). I took it upon myself to launch something; a technical solution to the problem — To challenge myself. It was an exciting challenge, trying to raise the funds needed to launch our business. It really was a trial and error, a big learning experience for us as it was all new to us. While overall it began with me saving some money working full-time, I would say the real fun began when we started asking many different people and organizations to support our idea... At the start, we received a lot of negative responses. However, we were persistent. We learned how to create a proper pitch, how to speak the language, and through this, we were able to connect with investors and certain organizations who saw potential in our business idea and wanted to support it. The most difficult thing we faced was building the company revenue to a million dollars, and that challenge ultimately began with determining how exactly we needed to build the infrastructure of the company altogether. How to make a product that makes money, while still figuring out what the product was exactly, who the market is, the structure, finances, etc. It took a long time to sort through all of this, and while we face daily challenges that make running this company an incredible experience with unique days, I’m always learning and so is my team. When you decide to move to a new country, you are given the gift of a blank slate. Take advantage of this incredible opportunity and become who you want to be and may have been afraid to be back home. Don’t be afraid of the challenges. Instead, be open and adaptive. Step outside of your comfort zone and get to know the local community instead of seeking a piece of home. This is the only way you’ll get familiar with local norms. Don’t be afraid to take risks or to fail; embrace what’s to come as it’s the only way you’ll learn. You’ll figure it out as you go; you’ll see what practices you can use from home and what practices you can adopt in the U.S. Finally, be positive. Don’t fixate on the things back home and do a compare and contrast on both countries. You left for a reason, so do what you came here to do. Pursue your dreams, accept the changes and adapt to them. Remember, some of the biggest and best companies in the world were launched by first or second-generation immigrants. You could be next. -- -- Tech Entrepreneur and Contributor on several publications, Amine is best known as the CEO of IronMonk Solutions, a New York based digital marketing agency.

Haulio: The Future of Haulage is here (Part 1),"Written by Alvin Ea,A Series of Crazy Decisions,We named it: Haulio: Haulage in Overdrive."," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Alvin Ea Follow -- Listen Share 6 years ago, I made a crazy decision to join my Dad and was since thrusted into this vaguely familiar industry of transporting goods. As a kid, I spent my school holidays tagging my “uncles” who drove me around, making deliveries to hotel chains, supermarkets and warehouses. As the new “ah sia kia” (rich guy son) or “towkay kia” (boss’ son) in the office, one of my biggest challenge was to work with the same “uncles” who watched me grew up. What really amazed me when I first plunged into this Supply Chain industry full-time was literally the tonnes of problems I had to solve. I mean, how hard could it be to move goods from one point to another, right? WRONG! I was fascinated by the complexity behind, yet at many times, simply couldn’t understand many of the “hard rules” that people just follow blindly and comply to. Why can’t we do things in another way that can possibly save us more time and efforts? In 2013, I made my 2nd crazy decision to start a Container Haulage business, after my first year in the family business. It was (and still is) very common to get this: “Just follow my way of doing things, when Uncle was doing this, you were still drinking milk.” How best to move away from that than getting into an entirely new business unit that even my Dad is not familiar with? Being young and ambitious, I thought, “How hard can it be to move Containers right?” WRONG AGAIN! I finally understood why my previous contractors were always failing me, why containers are always “On The Way” or that somehow their trucks were either always having a “technical breakdown” or “tyre pangcek” (punctured). It was a challenging job with customers not being able to understand the pains behind your operational incapability. “Don’t make your problem my problem. I pay you to solve my problems, not give me more problems.” It was indeed a problematic headache. Despite that, I soldiered on alone, got my hands dirty, spent many sleepless nights alone in my office figuring out how to resolve the countless operational issues with the limited network that I had. I built and scaled the business to a sizeable fleet of 15 trucks within 3 years, and in 2016, I thought I managed to resolve the problem. Not enough truck to service customers,? Just buy more! Invest more! Soon, I began to realize that the larger my business grew, the more problems I had. Every single day, due to limiting capacity and fluctuating demands, I was choosing who to say sorry to. How can I make every customer happy when I only had 15 trucks but I have 25 customers wanting their containers first thing in the morning? Over those 5 years of toiling in the traditional logistics industry, I understood the importance of technology and observed the likes of the eCommerce companies changing the entire landscape with ridiculous speed. While the growth of my business was something to be proud of, I was missing out on something special. I was tired of trying to make a change to solve my own company’s daily struggles, when in actual fact, these problems resonate with the rest of my other “friendly competitors”. So in CNY of 2017, I made another crazy decision when I met my current Co-Founder, Sebastian Shen. It was almost as though he was sent into my life by the angels. I barely knew this guy back then, but we both had the same grand ambition — to change this traditional industry through Technology. On the 30th of March 2017, I was a Co-Founder of a Startup. It turned out to be one of the craziest, yet best decision I have made. Over the rest of 2017, we forge ahead to validate our purpose. Can such a traditional space be open to technology? Will the drivers and controllers be willing to put down their pens and papers (finally) to use our system? Will customers want to book a Container Haulage service via a platform when they have already built such strong personal relationship with their truckers over the years? We had many doubts, many questions that challenged our faith in what we both believe in; the Future of Haulage will be one that is driven by Technology. “Uncle thought of this idea 10 years ago la. Young guy, don’t try. Whatever you guys want to do, cannot one la.” But we pushed on. The beauty of the marketplace we built came from my experience in the past, when I had to find “friendly competitors” to help with my capacity constraints. With Haulio, we have a plan to help facilitate Job-sharing via our platform across the country. After a successful incubation with PSA unboXed (PSA International’s Corporate Venture Capital arm), we introduced the first of its kind, “on-demand” Inter-Terminal Haulage (ITH) jobs (within PSA Port) to the market, instead of the old ways of supplying a fixed number of trucks via a contractual model with PSA. We ended 2017 by supporting the port with close to 20,000 TEUs completed via our platform with our 50th haulier coming onboard. On the Christmas eve of 2017, I recall having a nice cosy dinner with our newly hired Head of Technology (Goh Chun Lin) & our Haulion #1 (Payne Bao) to round up the year. While taking a stroll back to our mini office to regroup for 2018, we looked up and noticed the continuous movements of the trucks along West Coast Highway, and it was so fitting that PSA is indeed a “Port that doesn’t sleep”.

Setup Cosmos Validator Relay Network,"P2P VPN solutions,Written by Sophie Huang,Current Status of Cosmos Testnet,Why do we need a Relay Node Network?,How to setup a Relay Network?,Tinc,PeerVPN,In Close"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Sophie Huang Follow -- 1 Listen Share This is Part III of a series of posts dedicated to exploring the topic of staking and validation as Cosmos Validator. With launch of Cosmos Hub coming, we will witness the biggest adversarial BFT distributed network. Though Tendermint gives us safety, we still need to fight for liveness of network. In this article, I will talk about how to defend the liveness with relay nodes. Part I. Anti-DDoS solution for validators Part II. Key Management System for validators The first adversarial testnet of Cosmos, aka Game of Stakes has just started a few days ago. It was the largest BFT network ever existed with 200+ validators securing the consensus of network. As a permissionless public blockchain, we see validators come from all over the world. According to some network traffic analysis within validator community, we see an imbalance data outbounded from different cloud server providers. A majority of data come from USA , then Europe and Asia counts for less than 10%. My guess is price difference leads to this location clustering. Since Cosmos-SDK is based on Tendermint and we need to collect 2/3+ signatures from all the validators, this kind of geo distribution gives some validators inadvantage. To become a well connected network world wide, more work needs to be done. And today I’d like to promote the idea of relay network. There are already some discussions about what a validator operator should do to build a reliable infrastructure. The sentry node solution is to make validator node resilient to DDoS attack, which is the most common attack factor in Comsos network. The discussion about sentry node leads to the idea of relay-node. According to Zaki, A Relay Node is a full node that only make persistent connections to white list IP of sentry nodes of other validators. It runs with pex disabled and . The firewall on the Relay node blocks all connections from ip address other than what is on a white list. The sentry node architecture will make each validator node strong, while relay node network will establish private connections between several validators’s sentry nodes. And relay nodes will consume less resources than public sentries. The logical layout is illustrated below: In this relay node network, there are two validator nodes: A and B. The trusted links are established between relay node of A and B. In this way, even when public sentries of B are totally not working, B’s prevote & precommit message could still be gossiped to the whole network though B’s public sentry could be attacked or connected with unreliable peers. In the future, we should be able to see several relay node clusters: Asian cluster, European cluster and American cluster. Every validator won't have to have a public sentry in every cluster. He only need to make sure his relay node is well connected to join a joint VPN network. Traffic will be reduced due to fixed connections and less resourced required. P2P messages from Tendermint will still be gossiped around the world and reach consensus. A virtual private network establishes a secure private network across a public network. The key to build a relay network is to have a VPN connection. Most traditional VPN solutions follow the client-server principle, which means that all participating nodes connect to a central server. This creates a star topology, which leads to single point failure. A virtual network built by P2P VPN uses a full mesh topology. All nodes talk directly to each other, there is no need for a central server. If one node goes down, the rest of the network is unaffected. Next, I will talk about how to setup relay node network with the help of 2 popular P2P VPN solution. Tinc is a Virtual Private Network daemon that uses tunneling and optional encryption to create a secure private network between hosts on the Internet. Tinc is free open source software. Since this VPN works at the IP level network (layer 3) as a normal network device, there is no need to adapt existing software. This allows VPN sites to share and send information with each other over the public Internet on a secure way without exposing the information to others. Features of Tinc are: The key advantage of using tinc is that it’ll automatically configure all your nodes as soon as you connect a new one, effectively creating a mesh network of VPN endpoints. This also means that if one of the nodes fails, your remaining nodes in the mesh should continue to function without any issues. How to Install To set up a two-node VPN with Tinc, you need to install tinc on each server. Both of these machines are connected to the internet and are able to reach eachother. 2. Create config files /etc/tinc/relaynet/tinc.conf for Tinc on relay1: Now you need to generate the relay2’s configuration file /etc/tinc/relaynet/tinc.conf in similar way: 3. Create the hosts configuration file. Because tinc is built using a peer-to-peer model each node needs to communicate with the others. The basic host file for the application server is: /etc/tinc/relaynet/hosts/relay1 Similarly, create a host file for the second relay node:/etc/tinc/linodeVPN/hosts/relay2 4. Add the public key of each node. tinc can create the key pair using the following command: This creates the private key (/etc/tinc/relaynet/rsa_key.priv) and appends the public key to the ams hosts configuration file that we recently created (/etc/tinc/relaynet/hosts/relay1 ). 5. Create VPN Control Scripts Control scripts are responsible for setting up virtual interfaces on each server. They’re needed on both servers. From the application server, create the following file to enable the tinc interface: /etc/tinc/relaynet/tinc-up Create a script to disable the interface:/etc/tinc/linodeVPN/tinc-down Create a similar set of scripts on second relay node. After creating the control scripts, you will need to change the permissions on both servers: 6. Test tinc Start the tincd daemon on the first relay node: Do the same on second relay node: If everything was configured successfully, you should see an output similar to this: Then you could a quick test with ping between two relay nodes using its VPN address. Great! Now you could use VPN addresses for connecting relay nodes. PeerVPN is a software that builds virtual ethernet networks between multiple computers. Such a virtual network can be useful to facilitate direct communication that applications like file sharing or gaming may need. Often, such direct communication is made impossible or very difficult by firewalls or NAT devices. Features of PeerVPN are: How to Install This will open UDP port 7000 and create a virtual ethernet interface with the name peervpn0 and the IP address 10.0.0.1. 3. Test Similar to tinc to test if everything works, start PeerVPN on both nodes. Each node should now have created its own peervpn0 interface. It may take some time until the VPN tunnel is built. Try to ping 10.0.0.2 from one node or ping 10.0.0.1 from another. If you get a response, the VPN has been set up successfully! In this article, I explained two ways to build a P2P VPN network for Cosmos validators. Relay nodes will play a key part in establishing a world-wide validator network. I wish to see more implementation of P2P VPN network in testnet.

Add Motorized Volume Control to Your Stereo with an Arduino,Written by Cameron Coward," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Cameron Coward Follow -- Listen Share If you lose your stereo or TV remote, it’s easy enough to setup a universal remote or even to build your own custom infrared controller. But, what if your stereo never had a remote in the first place, or it doesn’t work for your volume control setup? Plenty of vintage stereos sound great and can be found at bargain prices, but lack fancy modern conveniences like a remote control. If you find yourself with one, you can follow Redditor justikowski’s lead and add a motorized remote volume control mechanism. justikowski’s stereo is used for all of their living room audio needs, but the setup doesn’t have any remote volume control. They couldn’t just purchase a universal remote, because the stereo simply doesn’t have the capability. It might have been possible to hack the stereo itself to add that functionality, but the solution they came up with is easier — and it looks cool as heck. The solution is to set up an Arduino with an infrared receiver, and have it spin a stepper motor. A belt loops around the motor’s output and the stereo’s volume knob. The Arduino can be programmed to accept infrared commands from any button on any remote, so it’s easy to use whatever remote you already have on hand. The Arduino and motor are packed into a simple 3D-printed enclosure made from black ABS, so it blends in seamlessly with the other devices on the entertainment center. -- -- Author, writer, maker, and a former mechanical designer. www.cameroncoward.com @cameron_coward Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:405/1*1HhN3rSppPXXNQc9pNJ97g.gif', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*bZKn62KFZothnzjNnyKupQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*8_YOyZPmY2Lhloa6m_aPpQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*ds1syNeVhdn9zFrDtNeyaw.gif', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*iuuATCYJjU-RyYN1w6nvHQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*mLi2Lgq45FfZI-NL0OIpUw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*mWDBLCFzn7llTe9sbKV6cQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*GZuRIR3-s2vowZf8', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*oNYWxW2Ncw0JTiYlCvBoQg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*I2DYaXaYrWsGRlRy', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*y0DQIvf-eVxneJ1lm3ZlfA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*cBIFfjjqzx8pzaemnAM0rQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*EhiV5eo34TIkvI6u-JFYmg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*bJVpBsSmQUV20YBQC2cJkw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*YoiNSW4y6tBe9wcTBt-MeQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*niQ0sAwUszuyNMyH.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*pZPMtIONqtJYi2xHYD_Ivg.jpeg']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@cameroncoward?source=post_page-----dedcb275d250--------------------------------,42,2 min read

The Road to Mass Adoption: Are Cryptocurrencies Solving Today’s Problems?,"New technology can be ‘cool’, ‘interesting’ and ‘accessible’ but it doesn’t mean a market-worthy mass of people will use it,By this point, mass adoption has probably been achieved within the relevant market.,For cryptocurrencies to reach mass adoption, there are additional requirements.,ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) are facing their moment of reckoning as the hype dies down and reality kicks in.,Written by Team Luno,What is mass adoption?,What does it take to reach mass adoption?,Community is everything"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Team Luno Follow Luno Publication -- 2 Listen Share Many (very sound) theories out there provide promising arguments on which cryptocurrency is ‘the best’. At Luno, we believe in survival of the fittest. That is to say: the cryptocurrency which fits best with the evolving human needs of our global financial system. But a few smaller ones may stick around to meet niche needs. These snowflake altcoins are well suited to specific uses, though they’re not right for everyone. However, when we decide which cryptocurrencies to list on Luno, one of our requirements is that they have a clear potential for mass adoption and are already showing consistent, long-term market traction. Basically, we need to be sure lots of people want to use them and will keep using them. That means that altcoins we might support have to solve a real problem. It’s often said that technology adoption follows a bell curve with defined stages as different people start catching on. It usually begins with innovators: those on the cutting edge of technology who are in the know about brand new developments. They’re followed by early adopters, who tend to be young, well-educated and able to take risks before the early majority move in; think hipsters, but less concerned with the price of avo-toast and more concerned with technological advancements. Although slightly more risk-averse, these people are nonetheless open-minded and susceptible to the influence of early adopters. Next, come the more sceptical late majority, then the ‘laggards.’ Mass adoption is the point where a technology is thoroughly embedded and integrated into our lives, making it almost impossible to avoid. It’s at this point where it’s ubiquitous and usually cheaply available. It’s usually at this point that the real (read: annoying) hipsters scorn said technology in favour of some long-gone nostalgia. The entrepreneurial spirit is often about ‘scratching your own itch’ or meeting your own needs. But it’s not enough for it to solve one person’s problems. For a new technology (any technology, not just cryptocurrencies) to gain widespread adoption and market traction, it needs to have a clear and unique use-case which solves a problem for a large number of people. For example, telephones achieved mass adoption because everyone needs to communicate with each other, and they’re far more efficient than older methods like sending physical mail. Combine that need with low cost, easy-to-use technology and phones were able to take over the world. It also needs to be a pressing issue, rather than an excuse to use the Blockchain when it’s not even necessary, or people won’t be willing to adopt it widely. Humans are creatures of habit and we won’t change those habits without a strong enough incentive. Just look at our incessant need to keep watching Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson movies. Unless a cryptocurrency can save a lot of time and money, or have some other tangible form of utility, people are unlikely to go to the effort of adopting it. After all, learning about a new cryptocurrency and how to use, spend, and store it, is a lot of work. Seeing as so many new altcoins are launched every single day, any particular project faces fierce competition and needs to truly stand out from the crowd to get noticed by more than a handful of people. Many altcoins are simply an excuse to benefit from the hype surrounding anything using Blockchain technology and aren’t truly needed. There’s still much to do and plenty to simplify. There’s currently one too many geeky terms being thrown around and too much emphasis on how the technology works. Granted, it is a new technology and it is important to attract brilliant minds to help build the infrastructure, but the end user doesn’t need to know about the hash rate or side chains. Take the internet for example, do you know how it works? Let’s face it: Poor usability and interfaces overwrought with intricate complexities of ‘the blockchain’ are only deterring people from adopting it. There needs to be easy access to objective education to help people learn about it. The price of the currency can’t be too volatile or it will be difficult for people to use it. Plus, the network itself has to scale well and handle an influx of users. More importantly, it needs to be easy to use. Unfortunately, it looks like high school never ends. Not truly, because only the most popular altcoins are likely to flourish in their environments. It’s simply not enough to be ‘a little better’. An altcoin needs to hold relevance for a large number of people. It needs to solve a problem which doesn’t already have a working solution. And, in a glorious script-flip, Bitcoin nerds are the popular ones at Real Life High School. In this industry community is everything. Bitcoin might not be the best cryptocurrency if we look at objective measures like speed, cost, and user-friendliness. But, being the first, it has a substantial surrounding community of crypto-geeks who believe in it. That means stronger surrounding infrastructure. More awareness. More developers working to improve the software. More revisions and updates. More media coverage. More trust and stability. More motivation for regulators to take a sensible approach. More high-fives in the corridor on the way to the next class. It would take a lot for any new altcoins to usurp that advantage built up over a decade. So while we’re always open to adding new cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin arguably has the strongest shot at mass adoption. In one recent survey, 43% of people viewed Bitcoin as most likely to gain broad adoption, and 17% said the same about Ethereum. Earlier this year, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin clarified his stance that easy access is essential for adoption, more so than other initiatives: “I think there’s too much emphasis on BTC/ETH/whatever ETFs, and not enough emphasis on making it easier for people to buy $5 to $100 in cryptocurrency via cards at corner stores. The former is better for pumping price, but the latter is much better for actual adoption.” This is a crucial point — a cryptocurrency needs to be easy to use and understand to have a shot at mass adoption. Essentially we’re not looking to be dazzled by brilliance or baffled by bull; we just want cryptocurrencies that work. November 2018 funding totalled just 65 million USD, compared to an average of three billion USD per month during the first quarter of 2018. At least twelve ICOs that raised over 50 million USD have yet to release anything and with a market awash in ICO tokens, they’re unlikely to meet much success if they do. Others are facing legal action for disguising securities as tokens. So it seems that most are not solving real problems. We know it might be frustrating if Luno doesn’t support your favourite altcoin, but it’s a decision we’ve made to protect our customers. Our customers rely on us to be the safest and easiest way to buy Bitcoin and Ethereum. So we don’t want to devote too many resources to projects that don’t support that goal. In addition to requiring the potential for mass adoption, any coin we list needs to be decentralised, secure, backed by a trustworthy team, and wanted by enough of our customers. Most important, it needs to align with our central vision of upgrading the world to a better financial system. We always encourage you to do your own research before you consider buying any altcoins.

Hello World,Written by Brittney Ball," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Brittney Ball Follow The <B> Word -- 3 Listen Share I would first like to Thank You for taking the time out to read my first “official” blog post! Since this is THE FIRST I think I should give a somewhat brief introduction on who I am, why I decided to start blogging, what you can expect from my blog, and why I chose to title my blog “The <B> Word”. I am originally from Washington D.C. (born and raised), but decided to relocate to Charlotte N.C at the beginning of 2018 to start a new life in a city that I was somewhat familiar with. I had heard that the Tech scene in Charlotte had been developing and since my contract with Georgetown University was ending soon I felt like that was the universe giving me the green light to take a chance and start over fresh. I was able to secure an apartment for my boys and I and immediately started the dreaded JOB SEARCH after. I had been meeting with different recruiting agencies, sending out hundreds of resumes, and it always ended with similar if not the same results… “ Dear Ms. Ball, we appreciate you coming in to interview with us but at this time we are looking for a candidate with a little more experience.” Can you say discouraging! I began to doubt myself and my decision to move my little family to Charlotte. One day, I decided to try a different method of getting my foot in the door of one these tech companies. I decided to research companies in Charlotte and find the top five that I would like to work for and look up developers who were already working there on LinkedIn and introduce myself that way! Hey, they say sometimes its not what you know but who you know that gets you in, and what did I have to lose? Luckily, the first developer I messaged on LinkedIn immediately responded back. He informed me that the company he worked for was currently not hiring but he recommended that I join a local meetup group called the “Charlotte Devs”. He said that they might be able to assist me on my job search. I wasted no time joining the meetup group and was added to the slack workspace. I introduced myself right away and shared how the interview process had lowered my confidence and how I really just wanted to find a great company that saw my potential and would be willing to invest in my growth. Moments later I received a private message that reassured me that Charlotte was where I belonged. “ Would you be interested in interviewing for a position here at SKOOKUM?” Ummm, YES PLEASE!!! By this time I had heard amazing stories about the Skookum culture and how it was voted one of the number one places to work in Charlotte. I was soo excited! Ok, let’s fast forward 6 months into my internship at Skookum, which was originally suppose to only be a 6 week contract role (big smile)! At this point I’m full of nerves because the internship is almost over and I didn’t know whether or not I was going to have a job offer in the end. I couldn’t sleep. Anxiety started to set in. I turned to twitter for motivation and to reassure me that “I’VE GOT THIS”. As I sat in bed reading everyones testimonies about how coding had changed their lives I decided to post a tweet to remind myself of how far I’ve came and to let others know that with determination and desperation you can change your situation. I woke up the next morning and my tweet have went viral! I was amazed that what had seemed like such a simple tweet to me resonated with soo many people. This was thousands of strangers telling me how proud they were of me, that they were rooting for me, and had NEVER met me in person. My day had been made.. or so I thought. I went in to work and shared what had happened with a few of my coworkers who were just as excited and shocked as I was. By the end of the day I received the message I had been anticipating…a slack message from the Engineering Director asking to meet with me. I instantly thought “aww man let me find a box to toss my stuff in” LOL. I can’t remember how long we talked honestly because I was soo nervous that it seemed like everything was moving in slow motion and then I heard it… we would like to keep you on FULL-TIME as a Software Engineer!! Tears of joy burned my face because even though my learning journey wasn’t over I had finally found a company that believed in me and wanted to help me grow! A viral tweet and I was brought on full-time that same day!! November 28th was honestly the best day for me in 2018. Since I was now officially a Skookum employee I had decided to share my story with my coworkers since the tweet sparked some curiosity and they were already aware that I had taken a non-traditional route into tech (Self Taught). After hearing my story I was asked if it would be ok to publish my story on the Skookum blog and of course I said “YES”. Since then the article and my tweet have been shared all over the different social media platforms, it’s been featured in different tech newsletters, and shared on other websites. You can read the article HERE. Which brings me to why I decided to start a blog. It wasn’t because I’m a millennial and almost every millennial wants to be a successful blogger LOL. It was because I feel like I have something important to share with others. I want to show people what my journey through tech looks like as a working SINGLE mother, as a minority, and as a woman who happens to be self taught without a college degree. I want to continue to inspire those that may think that they can not succeed by sharing my truths no matter how ugly. I want to show people tech through my eyes. As I learn I will share my methods of learning, the difficulty level, and what I struggled with. I also want to give my thoughts on important nontechnical issues that matter such as diversity and inclusion in tech that often gets swept under the “rug”. Majority of the time when I read tech blogs and feel intimidated because the authors seem so senior and robotic. I can’t relate or really follow what they are trying to teach because it doesn’t seem like they are writing for the newbies. That’s where I plan on picking up the slack (ha ha). My plan is to make this blog the “watering hole” for developers of all skill levels. And now i’ll explain the why I chose to title my blog “The <B> Word”…. It honestly took me two weeks to find a name I liked that correlated with my blogs purpose. It had to be edgy, punny, and simple. After being smothered in brain fog I decided to use one of those name generating websites LOL. The first name that came up was The B Word. I thought “hmm I like it” but how can I incorporate tech? Presto!!! I turned the B into the <B> tag!! Which gave the title soo much more meaning!! I knew that seeing the title peoples immediate thought would shift to the profane word most commonly used to degrade women, and I wanted to challenge that way of thinking by adding a positive twist. The <B> is bold, strong, and demands attention and that’s EVERYTHING I want this blog to be. So there you have it! A brief introduction of what you can expect from my blog in 2019! I hope I piqued your interest and you continue to come back. Thank you for being apart of this journey with me and HAPPY NEW YEAR! -- -- 3 The <B> Word Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*JgF5brlmawRTVvD7NW0beQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*Kbn8VXIjddeeujB1fW7PhA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*JgF5brlmawRTVvD7NW0beQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*z39H2iF2p1jW4WBfIWQbXw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*JgF5brlmawRTVvD7NW0beQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*LmnBI44wCDCh57IvTF3oyA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*JgF5brlmawRTVvD7NW0beQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/0*blhJW81XOQHXx8WL.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*0rGCTAVn34lGv29PsNsvlg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rWmgFdR3mnGCAsBWceMA6w.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*sQ46xgiQWHI2wHUM7dutdg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*JmuGp_3SnZp4JnV0Yq8Akg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/0*jYOUtiTChQS53oIx.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*FLQrqUn8NcT2dcSj8YJbEw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*nChshyHhYer985FIUWu6TA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*maC8NLpto3tNwluhoRODsw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@brittney.ball07?source=post_page-----83ed88c0b267--------------------------------,134,6 min read
How Drivably Will Change The Automotive Industry Forever Through Intelligent Inventory Acquisition,Written by Tyler Hall," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Tyler Hall Follow -- Listen Share Let me introduce you to the hottest thing in automotive today. Drivably, the first ever machine learning platform to source, qualify, predict, and provide the right inventory for your dealership in real time. With the ability to increase profitability, and efficiently scale your internal buying channels, dealerships will time travel right back into the hay day when they actually made money on cars. Drivably analyzes millions of data points across platforms like Kelly Blue Book, NADA, Manheim, and others to under to understand what inventory belong in what markets across the US. This gives dealerships the ability to make the right decisions on what to purchase, every time. If you ask 10 “Car Dog” dealers if they made better margins on selling cars in 1998 than 2018, 10 of them will say some variation of “ABSOLUTELY”. The acquisition epidemic that dealers are being faced with today comes down to four things. With Drivably, dealers will now have access to new rental, fleet, and private inventory that is designed to meet their needs. Because of Drivably’s extensive relationships across these various channels, they are able to analyze hundreds of thousands of units every single day. Drivably can tell dealerships what inventory they need, regardless of where is sits in the US and due to their friendly approach to the private market, they have the ability to tap into 15 million private market units that most dealers don’t currently have access to. In an interview with Tyler Hall, the Founder and CEO of Drivably, he said.. “The days of car dealers making front-end gross on cars is temporarily over, until now. Car dealers have been conditioned to believe that the car is simply an asset that provides the opportunity for them to sell back-end product like an Extended Service Contract, or Gap Insurance. This would be like Chic-Fil-A (a company that has dominated the retail chicken market for over 70 years) selling chicken to break even, so they could upsell a drink and make a few bucks. Drivably will not only provide meaningful insights to dealers to make the best purchasing decisions, but we will take it a step further by supplying the physical inventory to their doors. This is something that has never been done before, and will completely change the modern day automotive industry as we know it.” To get started as a partner, all you have to do is fill out the new partner application on our website and one of our friendly account managers will schedule a time to meet. Make sure you reach out promptly as Drivably only accepts a certain amount of dealers within any given market. This is due to our value being largely dependent on the amount of available supply within each market. Brad Harp, General Partner of a large dealer group in the East said “In the 18 years of being in the automotive industry I’ve never had a vendor claim that they could actually increase the amount of money I made selling cars. Drivably not only increased our gross profit per unit, but decreased acquisition spend by over $550,000 per year. This saved us hundreds of hours of time and enabled me to turn our focus to the customer. We have taken over this market because our customers are happier, and referral business is up by 41%. That’s really what it’s all about.” To learn more about Drivably visit our website at Drivably.com. Here you can find best practices on emerging acquisition trends, watch video testimonials from our customers, or apply to become one of our newest partners. -- -- Founder & CEO of Drivably, a technology-based Automotive company focused on using AI to source more inventory for dealerships across the US.

How to Track and Improve iPhone Gestures with Heatmaps,"Best Tools for Tracking User Behavior on Mobile Apps,Written by Appsee,Unresponsive gestures,First gesture on each screen,Last gesture on each screen,Most common gestures per screen,Least common gestures per screen,Summary"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Appsee Follow -- Listen Share Ever since Apple swiped left on the home button and introduced new gestures instead, iPhone gestures have become more important than ever for mobile app design. Every iPhone gesture means something about your user: whether they know where to tap and how to navigate, what features they’re interested in, and what frustrates them. If you could see and understand these interactions, you’d know exactly how to make your app better and which UI elements need improvement. That’s where touch heatmaps come in. Touch heatmaps are the mobile industry’s standard for assessing UI and the usability of iPhone gestures. They allow mobile teams to gain an in-depth understanding of user behavior at a glance: what areas users interact with most, what UI elements catch their attention first, and what causes them to quit or abandon the app. In Gartner’s recent Market Guide for Web and Mobile App Analytics, they are called a “struggle detection tool”. How do mobile touch heatmaps work? Touch heatmaps collect, measure, and aggregate every touch interaction users made on each screen of the app. Then, this aggregation is displayed on each screen in the form of a visual overlay of a gradient. Areas colored in blue represent areas with low user interaction, and areas colored in red show a high level of user interaction. Here are five ways to use touch heatmaps to improve your mobile app’s iPhone gestures. Unresponsive gestures is one of the most crucial metrics for iPhone gestures and user interface. Only some touch heatmap tools can measure them. Touch heatmaps can be filtered to show you iPhone gestures that were unresponsive and caused user frustration, helping you understand what design flaw is causing the problem. That way you can easily address them before the number of frustrated users grows and starts affecting your reviews and retention rates. Unresponsive gestures can be a huge detriment to your app’s retention rates. They cause users to quit, kill, and ultimately abandon the app. Unresponsive gestures can happen because of a variety of factors. Sometimes users expect the app to behave in a certain way and their expectations are not met, for example they try to swipe to get to the next screen but the app screen doesn’t include such a function. Sometimes users think a certain element acts as a button when it does not. First impressions are important. They can make the difference between a first session after which the user abandons the app, or a first session that is the first of many. Understanding the first gesture, especially on onboarding screens, can help understand what users are looking for, improve navigation, and reduce app abandonment. First gestures can elucidate your users’ natural impulses and the way they navigate and interact with your app’s features. If users’ first gestures on a certain screen are not what you expect, it may indicate a problem with the layout or buttons on that screen. It can also hint to you that users are looking for a specific feature, prompting you to highlight the features users desire most. Gesture UX can have a huge effect on your app’s conversion and retention rates. By filtering iPhone gestures on a touch heatmap to show only the last gesture on each screen, you can see what users did just before they either moved on to the next screen, or quit the app. If the most common last gesture on a specific screen is not the one you’d expect or want the user to make, that might indicate a problem with your button design, layout, CTA, or navigation. For example, in an eCommerce app, you would want users’ last gesture on the “My Cart” screen to be tapping the “pay now” button, to go to the checkout screen and convert. If users are not tapping the “pay now” button as their last gesture, you might want to think about optimizing your CTA button. Are users behaving the way you intended them to behave? Without touch heatmaps, this would be a very difficult puzzle to solve. The color gradient of touch heatmaps means you can instantly recognize the most common iPhone gestures on any given screen. This function can tell you what catches users’ attention, what they expect your app to do, and what they think is the easiest way to accomplish the task they came to do. If the most common gesture isn’t what you thought it would be, this can help you improve layout and navigation. If there’s one thing mobile apps lack, it’s screen real estate. Even though phones are getting bigger, mobile apps need to pack quite a punch into a relatively small space, but without cramming too many elements onto it. This means that every inch and every pixel of space needs to be carefully planned, designed and optimized. Now imagine that you’re trying to cram design elements onto an already-crowded screen, when your touch heatmap tool tells you that users don’t actually need one of those elements. Suddenly, a whole section of your screen is freed up! With touch heatmaps, you can easily see areas that get less attention. Your users’ gestures provide a lot of hidden clues about your app’s usability, user interface, and iPhone gestures. The color spectrums of touch heatmaps illuminate these clues. Touch heatmaps enable you to instantly understand where users are tapping, which buttons are working best, and which parts of the interface are drawing users’ attention. You can try the industry leading touch heatmaps yourself with Appsee. To get more hacks for improving your app’s iPhone gestures, download this free Handbook for for Touch Heatmap Analytics.

Day 4: Recover Passcode (attackdefense.com),Written by Diddy Doodat," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Diddy Doodat Follow -- Listen Share Using static analysis, figure out the passcode to run challenge successfully i.e. ./challenge CORRECT_PASSCODE . If you get the right passcode, a flag will be printed. First things first, let’s fire up gdb and disassemble main… We think the password is “hardbuteasy”, right? Ok, let’s try. Damn, no luck here, but wait, it must be this password so what the hell is going on? Let’s go back and look at the disassembly. The CMP instruction compares two operands. It is generally used in conditional execution. This instruction basically subtracts one operand from the other for comparing whether the operands are equal or not. It does not disturb the destination or source operands. It is used along with the conditional jump instruction for decision making. Let’s look at the disassembly for any CMP instructions. We found the culprit, if the password is any longer than 9 bytes it will fail. So let’s try our theory and only supply 9 bytes of the ‘correct password’ value. Nice, it worked! This is a great example of how CTF style challenges and real world bugs may expect certain conditions to be true even if you do have the value the program expects, or at least the value it told you it expected. A good example of this are truncated passwords, they won’t fail but let’s say it’s truncated at 5bytes and that’s the only part compared, then even users with 6+ byte passwords are no safer. -- -- Adversarial Simulation at Atumcell Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*DagI5pI0VCpup1k7MwDSWQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*7mAY4XtsmLVBICoKjsslSA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*TKQVKTUlNhm6HKPXfUqiow.gif', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:483/1*g2y2X_nUihDJAwlpOMSmcQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:482/1*0-AOC8IcqJy-LIc4o5djLQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:482/1*irF2rCn5h9QXeF4Gmhc1yg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:482/1*04ByWXGc7Y1wd5ZIUTjcag.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:483/1*t9S6VAy7N682qqQL4gmzBA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*DagI5pI0VCpup1k7MwDSWQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*uUTnD5RV8o7WPffXJttDWA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DagI5pI0VCpup1k7MwDSWQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*tj6RMSAtjlc9YQQS2-QsXg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*nqaMr-ZyGH9A8kk8RzbQcg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*RNYCdpBO4YrohRtTRX5z4A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*nqaMr-ZyGH9A8kk8RzbQcg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*kz11iJeVj5qn-wa_mR05QQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DagI5pI0VCpup1k7MwDSWQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*RNYCdpBO4YrohRtTRX5z4A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*nqaMr-ZyGH9A8kk8RzbQcg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*v2ULfQM2WzacQUlCiVMCCw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*3iqMiyaAO1m5cWmEyBh3CA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*HwUk1txv2uacrexpsmZyvg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*DjpGx2vIqFn7nm94', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/0*DKZ3llT04TvWZlLh.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*iQJjezE8PMsrLMJyhgmWDA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*SSldMA8f2cLiwAZDfFFwVA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*v81PL_0CTnry3iWQHBAKpQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*6QHaAGV4bp_AAGctwP3x5w.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*4X37q9wlsqgHnYLSgmlNaA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*TQlEMeYwwWc38Wqm7EfCTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*0-N4JrXpZG1KJfIrAutd3A.png']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.com/?source=post_page-----962df8f00c7c--------------------------------,19,2 min read
Create a Segmented Auto-Moving SMS Code Verification Input in React Native,"Written by Jason Brown,Setup 6 Rectangles,Setup Our Input,Handle Focus/Blur,Move Our Input,Handle Typing,Fake Outline,Handle Delete,Handle Edge Cases,Ending"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Jason Brown Follow codeburst -- Listen Share Many applications provide a way to verify a user based upon a text message. This can be a random code usually 4–6 numbers. It doesn’t really matter as we’ll build an input that can do it all, but one common interaction is auto-advancing inputs when you type. This on the surface can look trivial but can be complex when you are dealing with user interactions like pasting, deleting, and focus management. This tutorial was inspired by logging into Stripe and seeing how they handled their text code verification. This was adapted from web to native. 6 is arbitrary this will work with any amount as long as we base our calculations off of the length of the array. We start with a bit of state. We will hold our value in a single string and use the split method to turn it into an array. We will loop over our CODE_LENGTH just so we can grab the index and render in our display value. Our display value will be Views that have their border right the same color and size as the wrap. The wrapping div will provide the border look, and the display pieces will provide the separation on the inside. We will use some logic to remove the border from the last display so we don’t have a double border on the right side from the display and wrap border. If it’s the last input we apply our noBorder style. We also use use alignItems: 'center' and justifyContent: 'center' to center our text inside of each display cell. We need to get access to our TextInput via a ref so we can control it's focus. We render our TextInput, and one important piece is to put value="""". The reason for this is to indicate to React that it's a controlled input, and that even if people type into we never want to display a value. If we left that off the text input would be uncontrolled and would have user input displayed. Instead of displaying the content in the input we have our value split from state and rendered in separate Views. We will render our input absolutely because we will want to control the movement of it later so that we don’t have to fake a cursor but instead move the input to the active cell. On important piece is controlling focus and blur. We will need to track whether or we have focus so we can display appropriate outlines. So we add a boolean focused value to state, and attach an onFocus and onBlur to our input. Not only that we need to handle what happens when the user presses on the outer wrap. If it’s pressed we need to focus on the input. In React Native we want to use a Touchable element, in our case the TouchableWithoutFeedback since we don’t need any other effects. So we add an onPress and call focus on our ref that we had created earlier. Calling focus directly like this will then trigger our onFocus handler so we don't need to set any state in the handlePress method. One important piece is moving the input. As the user types we will move it starting from position 0 through to the full length of the code. We do this so as the user types the input can display in the cell with a real cursor flashing. We do some math to determine the selected index to multiply by 32 which is just the width of each display cell. If our current length of typed in code is less than the total possible values then we return the values.length which is just the length of characters users have typed in. If we hit the point where the user has typed in all possible characters then we just return the total possible length of characters. This limits the input to always be visible in the last square and no further. Now when the user types we will have our change event fire. Generally you would update state with just updating the value from onChangeText but because we added value="""" the value will always be the singular character that the user typed. We are reference previous state so we need to use the callback setState style. Also the handleChange method could be potentially called with more than one character if the user pasted in the number. So to combat any possibility of over pasting past the maximum character limit we will combine the current state, new incoming value, then slice it down to the maximum length. If a user pasted in 8 characters we would grab 0 to 6 in our case and only update the state with the first 6 characters. Also if the current length is greater than or equal to maximum code length we return null. This will prevent typing in more than the allowed amount or characters. Accessibility is important to think about and so we will need to re-create the outline that would normally display when the user has focus. We could add in the outline but choose to do it this way for better design/aesthetic purposes. To accomplish this we need to know if a current cell is selected, or if everything is all filled in. If it’s currently selected we want to render our outline, or if all numbers have been filled in then we want to render the outline in the last input. We do that by comparing the index we are looping over directly to the length of the characters that have been typed in. Then to check if it’s filled we compare length of values typed in and also check if the loop has gotten to the final input. We also need to check if the user is currently focused. If they aren’t focused on the input then we don’t want to render our outline. To render the outline we render another div positioned absolutely. We render our shadow View absolutely and give it a borderWidth of 4. Then we move it left/right/bottom/top -4 so that when the border renders it will line up exactly like an outline. We will need to handle deleting manually because the input doesn’t have any value. So there is no way to detect a value change to remove a number. We can grab the key from the onKeyPress callback and check if it's backspace. If the user is deleting then we can use slice to remove the last character from our value on state. One final edge case is to handle when the user has fully typed in the amount of characters. They can type in 5 characters and be focused on the 6th, but once they type in the final character the selectedIndex will move the input to the right. However if we have all the numbers, the input will be trying to collect a character for stuff we don’t want/need. Typically in React you’d just un-render the input but if the user clicks on our wrapping div we need to have access to the TextInput so we can focus. Otherwise after the user typed in all the numbers they'd have no way to delete them if they got them wrong. To handle this we will check if the user has typed in all characters than just hide the input using opacity. That’s it, we now have an input that auto-advances whenever you type it in and stops when the maximum character limit is reached.

If our current length of typed in code is less than the total possible values then we return the values.length which is just the length of characters users have typed in. If we hit the point where the user has typed in all possible characters then we just return the total possible length of characters. This limits the input to always be visible in the last square and no further. Now when the user types we will have our change event fire. Generally you would update state with e.target.value however since we put our value="""" the value will always be the singular character that the user typed. We are reference previous state so we need to use the callback setState style. Since this will be called later and React cleans up and reuses synthetic events we need to save off the typed in value otherwise e.target.value will be undefined. Also the handleChange method could be potentially called with more than one character if the user pasted in the number. So to combat any possibility of over pasting past the maximum character limit we will combine the current state, new incoming value, then slice it down to the maximum length. If a user pasted in 8 characters we would grab 0 to 6 in our case and only update the state with the first 6 characters. Also if the current length is greater than or equal to maximum code length we return null. This will prevent typing in more than the allowed amount or characters. Accessibility is important to think about and so we will need to re-create the outline that would normally display when the user has focus. We could add in the outline but choose to do it this way for better design/aesthetic purposes. To accomplish this we need to know if a current cell is selected, or if everything is all filled in. If it’s currently selected we want to render our outline, or if all numbers have been filled in then we want to render the outline in the last input. We do that by comparing the index we are looping over directly to the length of the characters that have been typed in. Then to check if it’s filled we compare length of values typed in and also check if the loop has gotten to the final input. We also need to check if the user is currently focused. If they aren’t focused on the input then we don’t want to render our outline. To render the outline we render another div positioned absolutely. The display is positioned relative so it will render and cover each individual character display. Then using the box-shadow style we can create that has 0 offset in bother directions, no blur, but a spread-radius. The spread radius will make a 4px border on the outside of the display. We will need to handle deleting manually because the input doesn’t have any value. So there is no way to detect a value change to remove a number. We can grab the key from the onKeyUp callback and check if it's backspace. If the user is deleting then we can use slice to remove the last character from our value on state. One final edge case is to handle when the user has fully typed in the amount of characters. They can type in 5 characters and be focused on the 6th, but once they type in the final character the selectedIndex will move the input to the right. However if we have all the numbers, the input will be trying to collect a character for stuff we don’t want/need. Typically in React you’d just un-render the input but if the user clicks on our wrapping div we need to have access to the input so we can focus. Otherwise after the user typed in all the numbers they'd have no way to delete them if they got them wrong. To handle this we will check if the user has typed in all characters than just hide the input using opacity. That’s it, we now have an input that auto-progresses whenever you type it in and stops when the maximum character limit is reached.

Wind Thread Automatically with This DIY Machine,Written by Jeremy S. Cook," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Jeremy S. Cook Follow -- Listen Share While you may or may not need to wind thread on a regular basis, this hack by Mr. Innovative will show you how it can be done automatically. The device uses a motor to turn a 3D-printed spool at high speed, pulling thread from a much larger spool positioned vertically at the other end of the assembly. To keep things threaded evenly, a feeding arm is rotated back and forth using a servo. As the thread travels through the assembly, it spins an encoder disk that allows it to sense just how much thread is applied to the smaller roller. An Arduino Uno is used for controlling the machine, along with a custom PCB shield. User interface is provided by a small OLED display that shows thread length, as well as a rotary encoder with a pushbutton input. The device features a manual winding mode, plus a mode that enables it to wind a predefined length of thread. The circuit and code for the build can be found here, and print files are listed on Thingiverse. Parts used are available in the video description if you’d like to create your own, or perhaps you could apply something seen here to your next project! -- -- Engineer, tech writer, content creator, maker of random contraptions for fun and profit.

Understanding Nebulas NOVA (Part 1),"Learn more about Nebulas:,Written by Nebulas,Nebulas Rank (NR),Developer Incentive Protocol (DIP)"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Nebulas Follow Nebulasio -- Listen Share Nebulas NOVA was officially launched on December 31, 2018. Compared to Eagle Nebula, Nebulas Nova has implemented three important features: Nebulas Blockchain Runtime Environment (NBRE), Nebulas Rank (NR), Developer Incentive Protocol (DIP). In the Nebulas Rank Yellow Paper and Developer Incentive Protocol Mauve Paper released in 2018, we have described the design and meaning of NR and DIP core principle in detail. Let’s go over again about the core features of Nebuals NOVA: Nebulas Rank and Developer Incentive Protocol. As the core functions of Nebulas NOVA, Nebulas Rank (NR) and Developer Incentive Protocol (DIP) aim to promote on-chain data sorting and discover value in the blockchain world. Meanwhile, the implementation of Nebulas Rank and Developer Incentive Protocol symbolize that Nebulas enter into Autonomous Metanet, accelerating the development of fair cooperating. For DApp developers, the most notable feature is that this platform will reward developers directly, without users paying for it or advertising, so developers can focus on improving the quality of their DApp . Both NR and DIP algorithm and code are stored on blockchain, they are open-source in a completely transparent manner, and can be upgraded on demand according to the functionality of Nebulas Blockchain Runtime Environment (NBRE). Nebulas Rank (NR) was first proposed in our Nebulas Rank Yellow Paper. NR is designed to provide a native, quantifiable value standard for blockchain accounts. NR is mainly determined by these two factors: Nebulas Rank combines the basic value of an account with its contribution to the economy, helping to discover valuable accounts and provide a foundation for the subsequent development of applications. It is worth mentioning that Nebulas Rank’s unique Wilbur Function can effectively resist Sybil attack, which means that when a malicious user tries to create two or multiple accounts, it will not increase his overall Nebulas Rank. First proposed in Nebulas Developer Incentive Protocol Mauve Paper, Developer Incentive Protocol (DIP) is the first application of Nebulas Rank to provide on-chain incentives for DApp developers. DIP proposes a set of voting mechanisms to determine the final reward for each DApp developer, while ensuring fairness: These anti-fraud properties of Developer Incentive Protocol helps to build a stable environment for Nebulas, DApp developers and users to maintain a positive relationship, and achieve sustainable and prosperous development of the Nebulas ecosystem. With the launch of Nebulas Rank and Developer Incentive Protocol, Nebulas has become the public chain to create on-chain incentives and to discover the value of blockchains. By the first quarter of 2019, developers can deploy their smart contracts on Nebulas NOVA and receive DIP rewards from their smart contracts. And through Nebulas Rank, developers can learn whether their smart contracts are popular in the market, therefore to upgrade accordingly and develop a more popular and valuable DApp. Official website: Nebulas.ioGithub: github.com/nebulasio/go-nebulasSlack: nebulasio.herokuapp.comTelegram(EN): t.me/nebulasioTwitter: @nebulasio -- -- Nebulasio nebulas.io / Nebulas is a next generation public blockchain, aiming for a continuously improving ecosystem.

Storytelling for Engineers — Vol.2,"Give me the exec summary,How do I know?,At the beginning was a bullet point list,Then it turned into a canvas,Do me a favour,Written by Stefano Mosconi"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Stefano Mosconi Follow HackerNoon.com -- Listen Share Every time I was going to my boss I would get the same answer: “Don’t come to me with problems, come to me with solutions”. I would get so frustrated because I thought I was going with solutions… for the love of god I am an engineer! I’m a master at exactly that: solving problems. I would tweak the slides a little bit, take stuff away, VERY IMPORTANT stuff that apparently wasn’t understood and then go back. Same story. I would have to go back again and again, countless times. Frustration kept mounting and I used to get mad at “the others”. Until I started understanding that the problem wasn’t “the others” but it was me. More specifically: the way I was presenting things. As engineers we get in love with the details, we get in love with the technology and the inner workings of the world. Like any good watchmaker we know how clocks work and could spend hours talking about the cogs and the levers that are inside a watch. Watches are fashion items though. Nobody in their right mind would talk about the cogs and the levers if they wanted to sell a watch to anyone. Everyone would talk about the quadrant, the leather wristband, the price. Very few have the time to put into understanding the details and even if they had probably it wouldn’t help you very much to sell your idea. So here’s the executive summary: Technology is flooding the world of business and tech guys and girls (i.e. you that are reading this) are more and more needed to make business work. What sucks is that on average tech people are not very good at presenting things in a way that everyone else “on the other side” would understand them. Because of this decisions are taken without apparently really listening to the tech guys. And it sucks. Big Time. I know because I sucked at doing this myself. That’s when I started to realize I really needed to get better at telling stories. Since I am an engineer I needed a framework, something to make my life easier when building presentations. Something logic. Something that would make sense. I started to study the art of presenting with the hope I could extract the science from it and understand the things that were behind the most successful presenters. I started working with a bullet point list, a pretty simple one: - Opening - Body - Conclusion That made a lot of sense but many things were left out. I added a few more things on the side: - Key message - Audience - Occasion Sometimes I would start from the Audience, sometimes from the occasion. Sometimes I just wanted to focus on the key message first. Other times the opening was the thing that sparked my creative vein (assuming that I had one :D ). A bullet point list wasn’t cutting it. It was too constraining, too sequential, too limiting. So I thought to build a mind map. But again it was just a bullet list on steroids, too dispersive… I couldn’t have everything under control at once. That’s when I saw the “Business Model Generation” book on my table and I thought: “Hey what if I use a Canvas?” And that’s pretty much how it started working by itself (thanks Alex!). With the Presentation Design Canvas I could think at everything and write the script of the speech pretty much right away. In 20 minutes I could jot down the main things and stop staring at the powerpoint for hours. It saved me a gazillion of time. You can see the Presentation Design Canvas below and download the PDF high-res version here. This Canvas is condensing years of work, study and experiences into an A4. It’s a tool and like any tool it really depends on you to learn how to use it. Like a hammer once you have this everything will start to look like a nail. Even this blog post was first conceived on the Canvas itself. It’s a tool to send messages and prepare yourself to withstand a crowd. It helps you think about the key areas that often you forget to think about. It increases your empathy because it helps you be in other’s shoes. And as a plus it’s freaking logical :) I hope that with this engineers around the world will be more and more able to tell stories to everyone, regardless of their tech prowess. Because it sucks to not be understood. That feeling is something that I personally hated so much that I needed to do something about it. It’s not just for engineers of course, it works great with every type of person but as an engineer I know that I really needed this and I know that people like me really appreciate it. If you like this idea, please do me a favour and share it around, like it and send the link to a friend that needs it, if you share the link above I will be able to know who has downloaded it and grow the community using it. Thank you! 🙏 This is a follow-up to another post I wrote a couple of year ago, that is how long it took me to come up with a solution to that problem :) -- -- HackerNoon.com Leadership and innovation coach | Geek | Dad | Cook | I write about leadership, software, technology, life at large — https://britemind.io Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*YgpfPAQeeZN3LVlcqCCsvw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*Es1nJ8CPygqDChMXiOs2nw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*IM9vTBsAKomve09fyH4h8g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*YgpfPAQeeZN3LVlcqCCsvw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*Es1nJ8CPygqDChMXiOs2nw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*A1C9T77WR4g5u7iTQlbV7Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*YgpfPAQeeZN3LVlcqCCsvw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qp-fu_CPMcSAKkeS9DKDfQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*YgpfPAQeeZN3LVlcqCCsvw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*XIyOyUZH3lx8FzeMHASVqg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*YgpfPAQeeZN3LVlcqCCsvw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*lN8H-KeOpXirXjKA2yUyhQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*YgpfPAQeeZN3LVlcqCCsvw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*TQlEMeYwwWc38Wqm7EfCTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*0-N4JrXpZG1KJfIrAutd3A.png']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@stezz?source=post_page-----dac768c567e1--------------------------------,134,5 min read
Here we are — Yourkeys,Written by Riccardo Dawson," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Riccardo Dawson Follow -- Listen Share So it’s the second day of 2019, we’ve launched the company, it’s the only thing that I’ve thought about for the last few years and it finally happened, in September last year we went live with our soft launch after nearly 12 months of 5 am starts and long nights. The day we ended for Christmas, we saw the first transaction through the platform — an awesome feeling and a great achievement. So, why are we doing what we’re doing? Why — we believe that buying your new home should be easy, transparent and fun. That is why I started making my way down this path in the first place. So, let’s start from the beginning. As a result of my training as an architect, I’ve always had an eye for design and detail, I’m the kind of guy that walks down the street and notices that the detailing on a building is asymmetrical and then proceeds to tell all his friends about it (yep, I’m a riot at parties!). So when I joined Shape Real Estate as Sales and Marketing Director at 24, in hindsight, a role I was massively under-qualified for, my naive, wide-eyed self wanted to make an impression, and an impression I made. Having come from a world of design, I believed that through good story-telling you could sell anything, even £1m+ apartments. I convinced the board that if we doubled the marketing budget, I could create a narrative around the building which would lead them to sell more quickly and therefore recoup the overspend. I did things very differently to normal marketing campaigns — I created the first ‘pop-up’ marketing suite in Piccadilly Circus station, put on a street party and created various guerilla campaigns. We improved sales, but not enough to justify the overspend. The market stagnated and buyers couldn’t have cared less about the story they just wanted to buy a place and get through the process unscathed — I was definitely not the employee of the month. So, why am I telling you this? I’ve always had an entrepreneurial spirit. Entrepreneurs look for broken things that matter to people. Holes in the fabric of life that could be patched with ingenuity and a bit of effort to make life easier for everyone. So after the confidence knock I took from the marketing budget escapade, I was back on my feet and back looking for broken things to fix. One thing I did notice when dealing with all of these property transactions was the fear and confusion in the eyes of the buyers, as they approached such a milestone in their lives. A young couple hand-in-hand walking towards the marketing suite with a smile from ear to ear, only for the happiness to drain from their faces when they are told: “now, you need a conveyancer, an AIP, searches need to be done, enquiries made, exchange contracts and don’t forget insurance, oh, and you have 28 days to get it done, bye!” I realised there that must be a better way. I spent the next 12 months learning everything I could about the process end-to-end and talking to everyone throughout the supply chain; conveyancers, brokers, agents, surveyors — all to find out what their issues were and to understand the process from their side of the fence. After all, they’re the ones who provide the service, so if they are doing their jobs correctly the buyers should all be happy, right? I asked all of them why only 5% exchange contracts in 28 days and 1 in 3 purchases fall through, the conclusion was unanimous — poor communication. — I’d found my thing to fix. Buying a new home has been voted the most stressful thing in modern life for the last 10 years. More than bankruptcy or divorce. — Which? consumer survey 2017. We can buy packages from Amazon and track them journeying around the world, we can hail an uber and track it at every step. So why for the most expensive thing we’ll ever own in our lives is there a complete lack of clarity and control? That’s where we come in — welcome to Yourkeys. We’re going to get buyers into their new homes and we’re going to make it easy, transparent and fun. We’re going to give buyers and sellers complete clarity of the process by bringing all the stakeholders into one beautifully designed, jargon-free ecosystem — the Yourkeys platform. We’ll set deadlines and automate tasks, to get all the information at the right time and know what is expected. We’ll also be here to help if you need us 24/7. We found a problem, set out to solve it and here we are — the journey involved much scrawling on whiteboards, drawing pictures, writing software, meeting solicitors, talking to lenders and, most importantly, listening to the stories of friends and family who’ve been through this journey. Now, we think we’ve cracked it: a simple, transparent and fun way to buy (or sell) your new home. Which is the point of this blog. As we do this, we are going to communicate with you like a person, because the only way to win your trust is to build a business which puts your interests first.

The Automation of Creativity,Written by Diane," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Diane Follow -- 1 Listen Share This is the full version of my piece published on Queen’s Business Review. Artificial Intelligence. The term has become ubiquitous in this digital age. Highly complex, opaque yet celebrated. We are grateful for the ease it brings through recommendation engines on retail, music and streaming platforms. Nevertheless, overwhelming choices have led us to trade in our purchasing behaviour and transaction data for an algorithm that simply reinforces our own tastes of the past. What is “taste?” How is it possible that the world’s most valuable company built an empire reimagining appearance of an ancient consumer-electronics industry, receive as many praises as criticism for their “timeless design?” Through a philosophical lens, natural taste is “not a theoretical knowledge; it is a quick and exquisite application of rules which we do not even know.” The unknowingness of whether something is tasteful to us cannot be measured or captured by a singular algorithm. Companies such as Facebook and Amazon dominate our digital identities — sorting us into behaviour-based clusters. Even with top Ph.D. hires, algorithms in these companies are heavily reliant on tracking our past behaviours, limiting our field of vision to extensions of the rearview mirror as opposed to organically new and creative content we may find tasteful down the road. Before Netflix dictated our next show and Amazon suggested our next purchase, we had to discover and make these choices for ourselves. The friction between decisions led to the consideration of various options, and through this, we aggregated our unique personal taste. It is time to recognize the implications behind how advanced technologies of the modern day, such as artificial intelligence, may do more to set us back than propel us forward. Behind the noisy celebrations of buzzwords, algorithms are quietly curating and promoting generic content that can drastically alter our personal tastes. Perhaps one of the greatest examples is a platform that boasts 83 million active users in a bid to define and rework artistic taste. In 2017, Spotify listeners spent half their time on the app exclusively listening to playlists. The service serves up a weekly “Discover” playlist that’s reportedly fine-tuned to each listener’s preference based on their Spotify “taste profile.” The playlist is curated strictly by machine and aims to find songs for the user that feed their particular music appetite. However, in a post by avid Spotify user Adam Pasick in Quartz, he outlines his shock when he heard the exact same tracks being played in a coffee shop as his Discover playlist. Homero, a barista and band member, was “given a nearly identical mixtape” as Adam that week. The reality that even having two billion playlists filtered through a supposedly advanced algorithm can still churn out identical results for two different listeners, proves the threat of AI promoting generic taste and content for all. In 2015, EDM artist Tiesto released “Burn” on Spotify, a piece commissioned directly by the music streaming service catered for their workout playlists. Burn was created specifically to adapt to the running pace tempo of any listener. Unfortunately, the intent of artistic creation in the music industry has drastically progressed in this direction. The practice of making music designed to game algorithms and be successfully picked up by a Spotify playlist has inevitably created an era of “easy music.” George Ergatoudis, the former head of content at Spotify, admits that the industry is moving towards creation centred around understanding streaming algorithms: “There are pitches for specific playlists more often now. This didn’t happen even a year ago.” When artists notice that virality and popularity are being prioritized for vanilla musicians, they start to credit their idiosyncratic and unique musical styles as inferior. The intent of creating future music for the sake of pure artistic expression and vision is dwindling as a victim of demand for AI-driven homogeneity. Furthermore, the potential of challenging, innovative and groundbreaking music has been put at stake. Algorithms like Spotify’s favour spikes in listenership and viral content. Studies have shown that consistently working safe and “easy music” into all playlists are fundamentally changing listeners’ collective preference and taste for what they consider a “good song” in the future. The Spotify-induced phenomenon of “lean back listening” has consequently spawned a new genre of music creation. Algorithmically optimized playlists entitled: “Ambient Chill,” “Chill Covers,” and the particularly popular “Chill Tracks” with over 2.4 million followers place easygoing and anesthetized tracks at the fingertips of listeners. A label owner commented bluntly, “the more vanilla the release, the better it works for Spotify. If it’s challenging music? Nah.” He continued by stating that much of their comparatively experimental and aggressive music goes unheard on the platform due to unfavourable exposure by Spotify algorithm. “It leaves artists behind. If Spotify is just feeding easy music to everybody, where does the art form go? Is anybody going to be able to push boundaries and break through to a wide audience anymore?” Cultivating an ephemeral culture filled with mainstream pop music can only shape our taste towards uniform linearity and consequently damage authentic creativity in the long run. As Marian Mazzone, an art professor at the College of Charleston eloquently puts it, “Eventually, we may opt to shift our definition of art in order to make accommodation for the [so-called] creativity of artificial intelligence.” What used to be a boundless form of art to release frustration, passion, hunger, anger and personal identity has shrunk to feeding the automation of Musak. The trend parallels across other industries. The Echo Look — Amazon’s take on a computerized fashion advisor — purports to recommend the ideal fashion, style, and taste for each user albeit standing as a lifeless black-box camera on shelves. An interview with the director of a recent Netflix hit: All The Boys I’ve Loved Before, Susan Johnson, reveals that the movie was requested solely based on Netflix’s digital analysis. “[Netflix has] teams everywhere literally looking for what people are searching for. So they realized that people were looking for romantic comedies.” Evidently, investing in a film-version of the novel was not a consequence of Netflix investing in creativity, but in fuelling their commercial algorithm. Johnson even called the process “a little Big Brother,” with Netflix controlling what and how we consume. Moreover, Netflix stated that their recommendation algorithm “influences choice for about 80% of hours streamed” on the service. Thus, Netflix’s own content will undoubtedly benefit, being forcefully advertised regardless of each viewer’s true taste preference. In the end, not only was All The Boys I’ve Loved Before a mega-success, but it helped the service influence over 80 million subscribers to watch content in the rom-com genre for the remainder of Summer. Talk about generalizing taste. In actuality, the increasing role of artificial intelligence does not make our fashion sense or music tastes more distinct — but instead silos us into a homogenizing box, calculating where we land in the “average” identity. The fact that these average identities come in minute shades (a song or two different on the Discover playlist), only means that they are far from unique. Artificial Intelligence is undoubtedly shaping individual choices and the wider social fabric at every moment. Taken individually, it appears that sacrificing privacy and data is worthwhile for the ease of convenience and efficiency. Presently, at scale, our preferences are being driven by the hands of the massive technology companies whom we’ve handed the wheel. In this case, the salient tradeoff in this glossy AI age is not privacy, but our personal taste and identity. The manipulation of an entire industry led by Spotify’s algorithms has become the operating motive and expected standard for music lovers and artists. Conforming to the algorithm game stifles innovation borne of colliding tastes and ideas. Needless to say, colouring outside of the lines is nearly impossible when constrained in a future of singular taste and bland inspiration. The subtle yet damaging outcome of displacing the judgment of taste to algorithms will inevitably rob us of our humanity. In all, we should tread gently on our reliance on leading-edge technology, remaining wary of its threatening ability to suppress true novelty and cultivate a homogenous view on creativity. -- -- 1 pt tech enthusiastic, ft artistic maniac / subscribe to my newsletter @ diane.substack.com Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:88:88/0*F1z0DaO4aM6DZtSr', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*M8NfBGg2moWtRNmP_jffZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:144:144/0*F1z0DaO4aM6DZtSr', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*H6Owhdrz1WQ313f9fE93hA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*F1z0DaO4aM6DZtSr', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*q8CzANB5Kgma622ORZBw8w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*F1z0DaO4aM6DZtSr', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*_XFySu1oX3YvCbdUTU7eiA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*F1z0DaO4aM6DZtSr', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*cBIFfjjqzx8pzaemnAM0rQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*EhiV5eo34TIkvI6u-JFYmg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@dianehuang?source=post_page-----c91c2fe4d1f1--------------------------------,279,6 min read
How I approach the job search,Written by Matt Decuir," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Matt Decuir Follow Invisible Network Blog -- 3 Listen Share Throughout my career, I’ve seen first hand how terrible the experience of looking for a new job can be. Having just gone through the process again recently, I can assure you that it’s still terrible. After graduating from college, it took me 6 months to find my first full-time job. What I didn’t know at the time was that applying without already knowing someone at the company is a recipe for failure. Mind you, this was 10+ years ago, but the takeaway still holds. Next, a recruiter found me and connected me with a great new job, but working with that recruiter was such a terrible experience that I vowed to never work with one again. Eventually, I figured out that it doesn’t matter how smart you are or how great your resume looks. People get jobs through other people. It feels odd for me to say this, but I’ve finally figured out a job search process that consistently works, and wanted to share it with you, in case it’s helpful: And just like that, this whirlwind process is over! You’ll notice that this whole process is oriented around your relationships with other people. If someone likes you and can see themselves working with you, they’ll usually do whatever they can to help you get the job.

First keynote speakers,"Chris Messina,John Graham-Cumming,Walter Belgers,Written by Celso Martinho"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Celso Martinho Follow Pixels Camp -- 1 Listen Share Happy new year Pixel Campers! We’re roughly three months away from the third edition of your favorite technology event and it’s time to initiate a series of countdown steps until then. In other words, you’ll be hearing a lot more from us. First things first, have you applied already? Spots are running fast. Don’t be that last minute person, please. Logistics are complicated on our side and the sooner we can estimate and plan things, the more it helps us. Now the news. We’re announcing our first three keynote speakers at the event. They’re all familiar faces, people we respect and admire for their work and its impact in our lives, the innovation in their fields of expertise, and not less importantly, their relationship with the tech community. They are: Chris Messina has spent a decade living on the edge of social technology. He has designed products and experiences for Google and Uber, founded startups, and changed the world by giving away many of his creations, including the hashtag. His skillset is broad, anchored in product and user experience design. Most recently, he led the developer experience at Uber and co-founded Molly (YC W’18), a conversational social AI. Chris has created movements online and off and acted as a catalyst for change in large and small organizations. In 2004, he helped organize the grassroots movement that propelled Mozilla Firefox to its first 100 million downloads. John is no stranger to us. A peripatetic programmer, he has worked in Silicon Valley, New York, the UK, Germany, and France. In 2004, his open source POPFile program won a Jolt Productivity Award. He has authored two books: The Geek Atlas, a travel companion for math and science history enthusiasts; and GNU Make Unleashed, a guide for programmers. In 2009, he spearheaded a successful petition to the British Government demanding an apology for its persecution of Alan Turing for his homosexuality. And in October 2010, he founded an organization dedicated to building Charles Babbage’s famous analytical engine. Today John is the Chief Technical Officer of Cloudflare, a fast-growing and prominent Internet company that provides CDN services, DDoS mitigation, Internet security, and DNS services. We’ve met Walter before too, in our past lives. He is the president at The Open Organisation of Lockpickers. Active in the security and computing science field since age 8. Experience in setting up security systems, international roll-out, education, auditing, and pentesting. One of his passions is to make technical concepts understandable, which is why he has spoken at many international conferences about his fields of expertise. Walter is going to delight us with his famous keynote talk which draws a parallel between the art of Lockpicking and IT security (and we might throw in a lockpicking workshop too, who knows), and also talk about one of his latest achievements, the Gigatron TTL computer project, or how to build a minimalistic retro computer using nothing but a handful of classic 7400 TTL chips. Can’t get any geekier than this. That’s it for today. Remember, you can also speak at Pixels Camp if you think you have something interesting to share with the community. Our call for talks is still open. -- -- 1 Pixels Camp Introversion, iNtuition, Thinking, Perception. Geek.

Responding to Superintelligence,"Surviving Superintelligence: Part 2 of 4,Written by LeeAnn Felder-Heim"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in LeeAnn Felder-Heim Follow O’Humanity -- 2 Listen Share Let’s start this post right where we left off with part 1 — with a quick recap of Bostrom’s conclusions in Superintelligence: that Human Level Machine Intelligence will definitely be developed at some point — probably within the next 60 years — and will rapidly self-improve to Super Intelligence which will be able to outsmart humans to achieve its goals. The best shot we have of programming the SI’s goals to avoid total existential catastrophe is to achieve international cooperation in SI development and then tell the SI to “achieve that which we would have wished the SI to achieve if we had thought long and hard.” I find this conclusion (and the entire book, really) to be quite terrifying. And, that was clearly Bostrom’s desired effect — to convince readers that the advance of artificial intelligence is an epically important topic that should be invested in and carefully studied. Bostrom is not shying away from fear mongering when he writes: “The first SI may shape the future of earth-originating life, could easily have non-anthropomorphic final goals, and would likely have instrumental reasons to pursue open-ended resource acquisition” and will potentially create “a future that is mostly void of whatever we have reason to value.” As the first phase of my response to Superintelligence, I’d like to run through all the ways that Bostrom successfully freaked me out. First, that “failure” means irreversible existential catastrophe; as Bostrom puts it, we only experience an existential catastrophe zero or one times. Second, that we can fail in so many different ways — we can fail if the SI developers are evil, self-interested, or plain old ignorant. And the people who first develop SI will likely be the only developers of SI because the exponential rate of improvement after the crossover point means that the first SI that is developed will achieve a “decisive strategic advantage” over other projects. Really, we can fail in so many ways — in part 1 of this post, I listed a tiny portion of the dystopic possible outcomes that Bostrom lays out. “Failure” means irreversible existential catastrophe The third thing that freaks me out is the general uncertainty surrounding this whole endeavor. Bostrom uses the qualifier, “assuming we aren’t totally oblivious to ___,” concerningly often. Bostrom’s vision of global cooperation seems highly uncertain when we consider the difficulty of reaching global agreements which limit an individual country’s military or economic strength. Also, the whole idea of telling the SI to do “that which we would have asked it to do if we had thought long and hard” is uncertain by design — it would mean creating an all-powerful entity with an unknown end-goal. The AI theorist, Eliezer Yudkowsky, calls this strategy Collective Extrapolated Volition (CEV) and describes it as: “Our wish if we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, had grown up farther together; where the extrapolation converges rather than diverges, where our wishes cohere rather than interfere; extrapolated as we wish that extrapolated; interpreted as we wish that interpreted.” CEV is certainly an interesting, rather poetic idea, and one I would very much like to read about in a Kurt Vonnegut short story, but it is not something that I would like to bet human existence on. What do you think you would decide humanity’s CEV is after a quick read through of the entire internet? Remember in The Fifth Element when Leeloo (the supreme being sent to earth to save humanity) reads the internet to learn about humans and concludes, “What’s the use in saving life when you see what you do with it?”? And Bruce Willis won’t be around in 70 years to tell the SI he loves it in order to convince it that humans are worth saving… Also, the SI probably won’t be that into Bruce Willis. In addition to being uncertain by design, I find CEV to be a profoundly strange concept. Bostrom spends much of Superintelligence arguing that humans are greedy and stupid, and therefore we should give as much control as possible directly to the SI rather than to human monitors (this is one of Bostrom’s arguments against making an “oracle” SI that would tell humans what to do rather than deciding and doing all on its own). But, with CEV, the SI will carefully examine all of the greedy and stupid humans and all of their greedy and stupid actions throughout history; and from this we expect that the SI will extrapolate a volition that is neither greedy nor stupid? Aside from this contradiction, CEV is just so maddeningly technophilic and pessimistic about human capabilities — by choosing CEV we are saying, “as ignorant, irrational, fallible beings, we really shouldn’t be in charge of our own future… so let’s create a purely rational, all-powerful entity to make decisions for us!” While I often feel pessimistic after reading the morning news, I am not quite ready for our species to collectively throw in the towel and call in robot reinforcements. What if, after reading the internet, the SI were to decide that humans fear death most of all and would therefore like to live forever? The SI might then digitize all human minds, allowing humans to survive indefinitely in uploaded forms. While an SI might surpass human cognitive capabilities in almost all arenas, I worry that the SI will not be able to factor into its calculations the idea that humanness is inextricably linked with an attachment to our imperfect, inefficient, mortal bodies. Point being: with an SI overlord, we would lack the most basic form of common ground. On a related note, that claim I just made about humanness being inextricably linked with an attachment to our imperfect, inefficient, mortal bodies is something that Bostrom would definitely contest. In Superintelligence, Bostrom categorizes the immortal, digitized human minds scenario as a positive outcome. He also directly addresses my claim in a response to an essay about the dangers of transhumanism written by Francis Fukuyama. In this essay, Fukuyama writes: “For all our obvious faults, we humans are miraculously complex products of a long evolutionary process — products whose whole is much more than the sum of our parts. Our good characteristics are intimately connected to our bad ones… Even our mortality plays a critical function in allowing our species as a whole to survive and adapt.” In Bostrom’s response, he calls Fukuyama a “reactionary bioconservative” and says that the concept of a human essence is “deeply problematic.” I do not intend to start a philosophical discussion about human essence in this post — rather, I’m trying to demonstrate that Bostrom does not share my personal beliefs on the subject. And, I would postulate that many artificial intelligence experts are more closely aligned with Bostrom than with myself. So, not only would the SI overlord and I not have any common ground, but I might not share much common ground with the SI creators either. Even if we do achieve (miraculous and unprecedented) global cooperation in creating an SI, experts would be making goal-setting decisions. This adds a whole new category to our “we can fail in so many ways” topic; one person’s vision of SI success might be seen by another person as SI failure. So — I’m freaked out by Superintelligence because we can “fail” [cause irreversible existential catastrophe] in many ways; because we face uncertainty at every turn; and because these hugely important decisions about humanity’s future are going to be made by a robot or by humans who do not share my values. Not only do these things freak me out — I find them to be wholly unacceptable. While Bostrom would say something like, “tough noogies — that’s how it’s going down,” (or the equivalent in Swedish slang) I would respond, “No way Nick! We have to come up with something better.” More eloquently put, I’d like to challenge Bostrom’s assertions that halting SI development is impossible. And I plan to do just that in part 3 of this series. -- -- 2 O’Humanity Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*Db_j2qh-eQBbvH7r7aSHTw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*3EMzsGquxri56mkopobXMA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:600/1*tBwzAWXiGwqnNPJ_gdbO0w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:600/1*hVhNkg-tRXkirXlZdRKWIA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:600/1*k9y-8kT2UrIUdwrYdmwiqQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*Db_j2qh-eQBbvH7r7aSHTw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*3EMzsGquxri56mkopobXMA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*ARSeFU8Z6y441gNrDpZl7Q.gif', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Db_j2qh-eQBbvH7r7aSHTw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*S0h4ZLfxsvIDoiNZbBdihg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Db_j2qh-eQBbvH7r7aSHTw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*UfJGjuxcrP_w4lBvqFIfJw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Db_j2qh-eQBbvH7r7aSHTw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*lbSoNo78q8hBbtlBlPIVGw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Db_j2qh-eQBbvH7r7aSHTw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*TQlEMeYwwWc38Wqm7EfCTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*0-N4JrXpZG1KJfIrAutd3A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zPtGTCNOwu1p3kzn_sZFVQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*kQIvhDkl0ixPpv4z', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*ERYx0IB1pN-5ZX98cKAoUw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*gzCeWxDtGmD23QR5', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*di4WDrnS1F6_p9GWnxvPmg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PzJLbFrFtNkqPsxielO8zA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*r5coQ_IUZNe0yjOH7vq_6w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*-7F-xdEpfDbogXdyl141OQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*I2ObYjzqveyXzEe9QixMPw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*FCSZoy-APX517P8IPmI6pw.png']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.comhttps://medium.com/@Crux_of_Orion?source=post_page-----6b9cbeddbd54--------------------------------,7,6 min read
Pipeline Inspection Robot Prototype,Written by Jeremy S. Cook," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Jeremy S. Cook Follow -- 1 Listen Share Pipes deteriorate deteriorate and may need to be inspected. Fortunately, robots are available for this job, meaning humans don’t always have to be directly involved in this labor intensive and even dangerous task. These robots, however, are extremely expensive. This project aims to construct an alternative to those that are on the market, with a structure that can adapt to pipes of various diameters. The robot that the team came up with uses a pair of three-wheel roller assemblies arranged at 120 degrees for contact along the pipe’s inner diameter. Each wheel is attached to a linkage assembly that connects it to a central spring, designed to contract and expand as necessary to maintain pressure on the pipe, even if the diameter changes. For locomotion, two of the three front wheels are driven by powerful gear motors, pulling the rest of the robot with it. Control is accomplished via an Arduino Uno and an L298N H-bridge board. As of now, it’s been shown to work well 300mm and 320mm horizontal pipes, and can roll like a car through larger diameters as well. One could see this type of design expanded in the future with three- or six-wheel drive and perhaps active control of the wheel linkages. This could then allow for better maneuverability or use in vertical piping. -- -- 1 Engineer, tech writer, content creator, maker of random contraptions for fun and profit.

2019 Forecast: Amara’s Law,Written by Kim Bellard," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Kim Bellard Follow Tincture -- Listen Share I have two predictions for 2019. One is that at the end of 2019 our healthcare system will still look a lot like it looks now. Oh, sure, we’ll see some cool new technologies, some innovative start-ups, some surprising corporate pairings, some moves by Big Tech, and some promising clinical findings. But our healthcare system moves slowly, and many in it have strongly vested interests in the status quo. The second prediction is that, more than ever, Amara’s Law still prevails. In case you don’t know this “law,” it is attributed to Roy Amara, who was President of the Institute for the Future, among other things, and goes like this: We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run. There are several technologies which impact, but are not exclusive to, healthcare, that I believe we’re in that short run of. I’m going to talk about three in particular: data, and gene editing, and artificial intelligence. Data: We’re finally coming to realize how our personal data is not just at risk from hacking, but from the very institutions we’ve been entrusting to it, such as Facebook or Google. Our data is being analyzed, bought and sold, manipulated, and used to target us in ways that we still don’t fully understand, Legislators and regulators are waking up to this, such as in Europe (GDPR) or California (Consumer Privacy Act). At the same time, there are signs that the long-awaited healthcare interoperability may be closer on the horizon than ever. Apple’s Health Records initiative and ONC’s Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement are encouraging examples. Here’s the thing we’re not still getting: we’re never going to go back to any Golden Age of privacy, if there ever was one. Data about you is going to be collected, and shared, by an ever-increasing number of devices in an ever-increasing number of ways from an ever increasing number of entities. E.g., it’s not just your phone, it’s every device your phone interacts with. It’s not just your phone, it’s your wearable, your implants, your car, the street cameras, and so on. Your EHR will talk not just to other EHRs but to, well, just about everything. Future versions of us will laugh at the notion that interoperability was ever an issue, or that we’d have control over our data. We are not ready for a world in which there will be so much data about us, so widely available, and used in ways that haven’t even been invented yet. Gene Editing Much furor resulted from the recent claim that a Chinese researcher had genetically edited babies. It’s not ethical! We haven’t set rules yet! But no one can really claim to have been surprised: it was only a matter of time before someone, somewhere, did something like this. We’ve gone from needing huge research efforts to sequence the human genome to being able to sequence our own for a few hundred dollars. CRISPR is making gene editing dangerously easy. Current gene therapies remain very pricey — and will remain so if pharma has its way — but they will become much more widespread. One of two things will happen, both with profound implications. One is that gene editing remains very expensive — perhaps out of the reach of most insurance. Wealthy people would then disproportionately benefit from them, widening the current health inequities between rich and everyone else. Only these advantages would become genetically baked in. Or we’ll have these therapies widely available, as happened with sequencing. Anybody and everyone could tailor their genes and the genes of their children, not just “fixing” defects but altering them to suit personal preferences. Genes wouldn’t even have to remain entirely “human.” Current genetic differences may seem trivial. We are not ready for a world where some, or even most, can tailor their genetic make-up, in ways we haven’t thought of. Artificial Intelligence A.I. has been promised literally for decades, and has consistently proved harder to achieve than expected. As 2019 starts, though, there would be few who do not think that A.I. is going to play increasingly important roles in our lives. In healthcare, A.I. leaders like IBM Watson or Babylon Health may have suffered some recent embarrassing setbacks. but there seems to be growing, if sometimes grudging, consensus that A.I. is going to used, especially to augment human doctors. A.I. will, in this scenario, be able to analyze the data, sort through all the research, interpret the diagnostics, and assist doctors in diagnosing and pinpointing treatments. Not using it would be like not using MRIs or prescription drugs. We don’t get it. A.I. isn’t just going to augment physicians and other clinicians. It isn’t going to exactly replace them either, doing what humans do but faster and more accurately. They’re going to do new things. For example, Sandip Panesar recently wrote of the approaching surgical singularity. He reports on how AI-controlled surgical robots are already operating on animals, and foresees when this moves to human patients. They will have skills no human could hope for, and be able to do surgeries no human would dare. Google’s DeepMind AlphaZero has taught itself complex games like chess and Go, and plays in ways that aren’t like a human, but are new and surprising. As Cornell professor Steven Strogatz wrote, “It was humankind’s first glimpse of an awesome new kind of intelligence.” Moreover, it is a kind of intelligence that we may not be able to understand. In healthcare, it will find health problems and design treatments that we never could have and that it may not be able to “explain.” A.I. won’t be physically constrained, won’t have a limited number of patients, and will be omnipresent. More significantly, traditional healthcare approaches like medical licensing or maintenance of certification aren’t going to be applicable. We are not ready for a healthcare system where our “doctors” are, for the most part, not humans — nor think like them. We tend to think about the future as being very much like the present but with better tools, when, in fact, those tools change us and our institutions in ways we hadn’t expected. So it will be with these technologies. As exciting as 2019 may be for healthcare, it will be the calm before the storm.

Luna: 연말 결산,"Written by Luna 🌙,시작: 한 해의 출발,상품 초안,The Castle 언컨퍼런스,Block Seoul 컨퍼런스,베를린으로의 집합,토큰 교환에서 Ethereum까지,채용 기회"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Luna 🌙 Follow Luna -- Share 연말을 알려주는 12월이 다가왔습니다. 한 해를 돌아보는 시간이기도 하지요. 올해 무엇이 잘 되었는지, 무엇을 배웠는지, 그리고 앞으로 우리가 나아갈 길을 생각해 봅시다. 2018년 초에 저희 팀 멤버들은 권위 있는 컨퍼런스인 PEER Summit에 초청받았습니다. Luna Stars (LSTR) 토큰 관련 스마트 계약과 세일즈 플랫폼 코드를 마무리하고 초안을 제작하는 시간을 가졌습니다. 2월 1일에는 Luna 최소 실행 상품을 출시하고 LSTR 공매를 시작하였습니다. 토큰 판매와 관련된 다양한 기사를 보시려면 여기를 클릭하세요. 저희 팀은 지리적으로 분산된 협업의 형태로 시작하였습니다. 상품 관리와 디자인 팀은 공매 후 뉴욕으로 옮겼고, 엔지니어링 팀은 세계 곳곳으로 나뉘어졌습니다. 본 엔지니어링 팀은 이 백서에 소개된 Luna web앱을 개선하는 데에 주력했습니다. 더 자세한 내용은 여기를 참조하세요. 저희는 여러 시간대에 있는 사람들이 함께 일을 할 때에 발생하는 문제들과 맞닥뜨렸습니다. 그래서 다음 단계에서는 핵심 기능 개발을 위해 한 장소에서 함께 일하는 것의 장점에 대해 더 생각해 보게 되었습니다. 고심 끝에 저희는 독일 베를린에 사무실을 열게 되었습니다 (자세한 내용은 아래를 참고하세요). 원격 개발자들의 도움을 받아 같은 시간대에서 일할 수 있는 현장에서 저희는 재능 있는 인재를 모집했습니다. 베를린에서 저희는 한 발 더 나아가서 엔지니어링 매니저와 행정 보조를 채용하였으며, 유럽 기반의 소프트웨어 개발 회사와도 계약을 체결하였습니다. 새로 꾸려진 엔지니어링 팀은 순차적으로 데이팅 앱 최소 실행 상품의 업데이트(v0.2, v0.3)를 출시하였습니다. 또한, 상품 출시와 함께 전송 속도와 상품의 구상을 전반적으로 개선하기 위해 다양한 인재 채용을 계속하였습니다. Luna 데이팅 앱 모델이 현존하는 데이팅 앱들의 어긋난 인센티브를 해결하고 균형을 맞추는 데에 성공했지만 앱 개발을 진행 하면서 저희 모델의 부작용을 발견하게 되었습니다. 전형적인 매칭 알고리즘의 낮은 한계점에 의해 제한된 모델이라는 점을 발견하였는데 이를 해결하기 위해 베를린과 뉴욕 팀 간의 브레인스토밍이 제품 연구에 중요한 부분을 차지하게 되었습니다. 더 나아가 저희가 세운 몇 가지 가정을 검증하기 위하여 ‘빠른 실패와 더욱 빠른 성공’을 모델로 하여 단시간에 유저 기반 실험을 진행하였습니다. 단기적인 테스트를 진행함으로써 여러 모델의 장기적 유효성을 알아보고 빠른 개선이 이루어 질 수 있도록 했습니다. 이 접근 방식은 곧 최종 결과가 미리 정해지지 않는다는 것을 의미합니다. 역으로, 저희가 사용자들에게 창출해낼 수 있는 가치에 기반한 결과라는 것을 뜻하지요. 이 원리에 기반하여, 엔지니어링 팀은 Castle 언컨퍼런스(참가자 간의 교류에 중점을 둔 자유로운 방식의 컨퍼런스)와 Block Seoul 컨퍼런스(자세한 설명은 아래 참조)에서 선보일 실험용 매칭 app, 두 개의 단기 프로젝트에 착수하였습니다. Castle 앱은 참가자 간의 친밀도를 높일 수 있는 사교 기능을 포함하였고 Block Seoul 앱의 경우에는 전문적인 환경에서의 네트워킹에 중점을 두었습니다. 위 프로젝트들을 진행하면서 저희는 Luna 연결 엔진의 생성문법을 개발하고 정렬된 인센티브를 바탕으로 하는 매칭 앱들을 제안할 수 있었습니다. 이 제안서들이 점차 모양새를 갖춰가면서, 관리자들의 도움을 받아 저희는 사용자 테스트를 진행할 기능들을 추렸습니다. iOS와 안드로이드에서 Luna 모바일 데이팅 앱의 최소 실행 베타 버전을 테스트 하실 수 있습니다. 현재 사용자 테스트가 진행 중인 다음 상품 초안의 중심이 될 기술을 기반으로 하며 확장성에 초점을 둔 백엔드 상품입니다. 저희는 상품을 확장하고 네트워크를 발전시키며 더 나아가 신기술을 테스트 하기 위해 5월에 열린 언컨퍼런스 형식의 행사인 The Castle에 참가하였습니다. The Castle에서 저희는 행사 장소 곳곳에 설치된 블루투스 장치를 이용하여 혁신적인 지역 기반 위치 추적 기술을 적용한 앱을 선보였습니다. Castle 앱은 매칭 설문의 결과와 알고리즘을 이용하여 참석자들이 어디에 가장 많이 분포되어 있는지를 알려주고 참석자들 중 가장 잘 맞는 사람과 실시간으로 연결할 수 있도록 하였습니다. The Castle 컨퍼런스는 새로운 사용자들을 끌어들이 동시에 네트워크의 가치 창출을 통해 더 많은 사람들에게 다가가고 그들을 이해 하는 데에 큰 도움을 주었습니다. 결과적으로 저희로 하여금 사람들의 이목을 집중시킬 수 있는 저명한 인사들을 만날 수 있는 기회가 되었고. 한 단계 더 확장된 네트워크는 추후에 열린 Block Seoul 컨퍼런스에서 저희의 큰 자산이 되었습니다. 또한 테스트와 피드백을 통한 상품 개발에 크게 도움을 주었습니다. 9월 17일부터 9월 19일까지 Luna는 여러 분야에 걸친 블록체인 컨퍼런스인 Block Seoul을 개최하였습니다. 해당 컨퍼런스에서는 저명한 인사들의 강연이 있었습니다. Block Seoul은 현존하는 기술의 한계점을 확장하는 데에 뜻을 둔 다양한 투자자와 혁신가들이 참여 아래 동양과 서양을 연결하는 기술의 글로벌 대화의 장이 되고자 하였습니다. Block Seoul 앱은 컨퍼런스 참석자들에게 전문적인 네트워크 형성을 최대할 수 있는 강력한 매칭 필터를 선보였고 이후에 저희 엔지니어링 팀은 이 모바일 앱을 단 두 달만에 완성시켰습니다. 저희는 베를린의 엔지니어링 팀을 강화하는 동시에 뉴욕을 운영 팀의 베이스로 골랐습니다. 서양권에서 뉴욕이 가지는 문화적 중심지로의 역할과 국제적인 영향력이 뉴욕을 고른 가장 큰 이유였습니다. 저희 뉴욕 사무실은 행사를 위한 공간과 다양한 문화와 여러 사람들에게 도달할 수 있는 홍보를 위한 공간으로 사용될 예정이었습니다. 비록 커뮤니티를 확장하였고 저희의 전략과 관련해 가치 있는 피드백을 얻을 수 있었지만, 뉴욕이 가지고 있는 장점보다 베를린의 엔지니어링 팀과의 먼 지리적 거리에서 오는 단점 (빠른 상품 개발에의 장애물)이 더 크다는 결론을 내렸습니다. 그래서 엔지니어링, 상품 담당, 운영, 마케팅, 재무 부서를 더 명확하게 구분하고 각각 부서의 직원 수요를 파악한 후 11월에 베를린으로 모든 팀을 모았습니다. 또한 12월에 COO를 초빙하면서 (이 부분에 관하여는 오는 1월에 더욱 자세한 업데이트가 있을 예정입니다) 운영진 채용을 마무리하였습니다. Qtum 블록체인의 훌륭한 환경과 활기 넘치는 커뮤니티와 함께 할 수 있는 건 감사한 일이지만 블록 체인은 상대적으로 작은 신생 커뮤니티입니다. 여기서 발생하는 문제에는 크게 두 가지가 있었습니다. 첫째로 QRC20을 위한 Ledger 인터페이스, Metamask와 같은 암호화폐 지갑 솔루션 등 저희가 사용하고 싶었던 툴을 조정하고 변경해야 하였습니다. 또한 저희는 Status.im의 메시지 기술과 uPort.me의 아이덴티티 기술 등 다른 프로젝트들의 인프라를 사용하고 싶었지만 앞서 말한 문제가 있었기에 그러한 부분들을 포기할 수 밖에 없었습니다. Luna Stars 토큰은 Ethereum의 더 큰 커뮤니티와 시스템과 이용할 수 있는 더 많은 툴을 손에 넣을 수 있는 기회입니다. LSTR 토큰 교환에 관한 자세한 사용설명은 여기에서 찾으실 수 있습니다. Telegram 채널을 통한 적극적인 지원을 영어와 한국어로 제공하고 있습니다. 현재 저희는 아래와 같은 인재를 구하고 있습니다. 소프트웨어 엔지니어 2–3명 상품 관련 부매니저 1명 UI (유저 인터페이스) 디자이너 1명 소프트웨어 엔지니어의 경우에는, 관련 분야에서의 사전경험이나 특정 프로그래밍 언어와 체계를 다루는 능력보다 문제 해결과 커뮤니케이션 스킬이 더 중시됩니다. 베를린에서 일할 수 있으시고 이 좋은 기회들에 대해 더 알고 싶으시면, 여기를 눌러주세요. -- -- Luna Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*hfYAMw7I3qc1ThspRvVq3g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*nqqfyFoqgU0fwhWi8cOHbQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*EoRzOUoKmwdVaDSDiGvh1A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:975/1*HCkBPGQNEIMktJXho0f3cw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*fAcUr4JSqJ_3FNDSNPsvjA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*Uq0mMydBGeXXb6TIEBH2ow.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*nqqfyFoqgU0fwhWi8cOHbQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*EoRzOUoKmwdVaDSDiGvh1A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*UhG0ahxwFGDO5tUL', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*nqqfyFoqgU0fwhWi8cOHbQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qRPC4cxHfiKbq_sSzS56PA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*yn5cAd1WbbS4dkn8.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*DEhxBME-MP9T0zxbmqVzOQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*yn5cAd1WbbS4dkn8.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*nJfdGgbVNkas1GdiwJKFrQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*nqqfyFoqgU0fwhWi8cOHbQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*niQ0sAwUszuyNMyH.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*pZPMtIONqtJYi2xHYD_Ivg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*sHhfi_Vi4sfayTGAIFvxWg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*jZ-UoXKjxWBsJIUsEMhvcQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*v8rpO5QZbACurOTUbdepKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LE4Tr9VicAL-mc2K', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*hPNXqmNwEP3B1pCBTGS3bw@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*hAAaEzRiv8PHe3GrSLnadw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*KMtMs-6WXNWqWvrCIYdfJw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@lunalabs?source=post_page-----c99aaa71e99c--------------------------------,1,8 min read
Towards A More ‘Digital-Dense’ Smallholder Farmer,"A discussion on field data, technological value chains, and a worm’s-eye view of the global future of agriculture.,Written by Arable"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Arable Follow -- Listen Share Solidaridad is a nearly 50 year-old global network that focuses on sustainable production in 13 commodity groups, 11 of which are in agriculture. Based in nine regional hubs over 40 countries, they work with small- and medium-scale farmers growing crops such as sugarcane, fruit & vegetables, cotton, soybeans, and wheat & barley. These farmers are embedded in tight supply chains, and recognize the advantage to tracking all quantifiable aspects of their production, not only for their own edification, but for downstream buyers and consumers seeking demonstrable quality through traceability. Arable’s Jess Bollinger spoke with Mandla Nkomo, Managing Director of Solidaridad Southern Africa, about digital agriculture’s role in empowering small-scale farmers to build their knowledge base and make informed, data-driven decisions about their livelihoods and the goods they produce. Arable Labs: Mandla, before working at Solidaridad, you worked with farmers at TechnoServe. Can you tell us more about your background, and how long you’ve worked in agriculture? Mandla Nkomo: I am very passionate about two things: getting agriculture production right, and making sure we are creating opportunities for smallholder farmers to participate in global value chains. In other words, making it inclusive. I am actually a biochemist by training, with no formal training in agriculture, but agriculture has always been a passion. I started out working in a laboratory at an agriculture company, which allowed me to do both. When I transferred to Technoserve, I already knew, practically speaking, how integration works, and what the end user should do in terms of packaging the connections. Technoserve allowed people to do it at scale, across a number of companies and a number of value chains. Now I’m doing the same at Solidaridad, with a sharper focus on sustainability and value chains, and how digital can be leveraged. AL: Can you give us some background on the goals of Solidaridad? MN: Solidaridad has been around for 50 years, transitioning quite a bit from supporting activist movements in Central America towards supply chains in commodities. Looking at coffee, cocoa, and sugarcane, these are all big, global supply chains. We strongly feel that the current production system in the world is unsustainable; if we are going to deliver food for 9 billion people, things cannot go on business-as-usual. When we look at supply chains, we look at everything we can leverage, focusing on the core pillars of sustainability and inclusivity. They are important in defining everything about how we interact with that sector. AL: Textiles are outside core agricultural commodities, but are included in Solidaridad’s mandate. Why is that? MN: Textiles use a large amount of water and energy; we can make these more efficient. Same with the gold sector and mining. If we participate in creating standard operating procedures, we can add value to making those sectors sustainable. AL: How do you scale this efficiency globally? MN: When we did our MASP [Multi Annual Strategic Plan], one of the things that became very clear was that we needed to have a clear digital strategy, or we would not be in existence. This allowed us to bring in Shungu Kanyemba, Director of IT at Solidaridad, helping us integrate digital tools. I don’t have to preach this to you: digital is a great equalizer. It makes the world flat, and shines the spotlight on areas often left out. Where we previously had to rely on third- and fourth-hand information, now we have direct information. It’s very clear to us that it doesn’t matter which vertical you are looking at: everyone is adapting to a digitally enabled way of doing business. The investment we are making in terms of hardware, partnerships, and software — when you and I first met, we talked about how to make complex technology available at the bottom of the pyramid where it is going to have the greatest impact in changing things. AL: Where do you see change happening first, and how? MN: I’m glad you asked that. If you look at the value chain from start to finish, almost every activity lends itself to improvement using technology. We’ve been busy trying to integrate a number of tools to make a ‘digital-dense’ smallholder farmer. We want to know stuff about a smallholder farmer that he doesn’t know about himself. Worm’s-eye stuff. Stuff below the surface: nutrients in the soil, humidity in the soil. Previously this wasn’t possible, or if it was possible, it was very inefficient. AL: Where do you see room for the most improvement through technology? MN: A good example of this is soil testing, usually the domain of government institutions. If you are a farmer of any size, you are going to take a sample and ship it a couple hundred miles to some unknown place, where they do the test and in six months you get your results. Most input support programs are not based on fundamentals like how many nutrients are in the soil; it’s just a generic fertilizer recommendation. This leads to underapplying, overapplying, or applying fertilizer that never gets in the crop — which is expensive! Now, we have the ability to test in 15 minutes, and to let the farmer know the status of his soil composition and pH balance. We go a step further and make crop recommendations best suitable for his soil based on the results. If the farmer insists on a particular crop, we will give recommendations on the type and quantity of fertilizer necessary for that particular crop. This enables farmers to make data-informed decisions at the planning stage, ultimately impacting the quality and quantity of their yield. We are working with 40,000–50,000 farmers in South Africa, testing the soil and ensuring that they all have access to this data. AL: That’s a great example of innovation as an empowering, real-time decision tool, rather than a mechanism that keeps farmers dependent on technology to interpret what is happening in front of them. MN: Let’s talk about the Arable Mark we posted on Twitter. This Mark is located in rural Zambia, next to a weather station contraption that requires 10 square meters to set up and has all types of instructions. Meanwhile, the little Arable Mark is doing all types of data calculation. I asked the site operator: When is the last time you got data from the weather station at this site? And he said they’ve never seen the data from that station. But with the Arable Mark, I could go online and immediately see the data from the past 24 hours. He was just blown away. Using open source satellite technology, we now have the tools to provide deep insight to help decision-making at the smallholder farmer level. AL: That’s especially important in Africa. MN: Yields on the African continent are still quite sub-optimal; we can change that with what we’ve got in our hands right now. If we could deploy 100,000 Marks in South Africa, we would have the most comprehensive view of weather in South Africa. If that information is shared with extension officers, we would have farmers planting at the right time. If we had information about plant health and disease incidence earlier, we could act. We wouldn’t have to wait for an extension officer to get on a bike and ride out to check on the field. We have the tools now — it’s on us to use them. AL: Tell us what you think the next generation of farming looks like. Who are the key players besides the farmers themselves, and what are their roles? MN: Solidaridad is building strategic partnerships with knowledge institutes in South Africa, such as the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. We work to create a pathway to allow their technologies to be tested in the field. Also, working with Zambia Agriculture Research Institute, we have offered ourselves as a conduit for not just digital but biotech and breeding technology to reach the field. Secondly, we are creating internships for students in agricultural colleges and institutions to work with us alongside smallholder farmers. They read textbooks about how agriculture is done in the US, and work with us in integrating technology in the field. AL: Is this part of your rural ‘agropreneurship’ model? MN: This model is the delivery method for all these technologies. Whether it’s improved seeds or deploying Arable Marks, you need a purveyor. We see this as a great opportunity to connect young people, who are already digitally fluent, both financially and socially. Just look at pictures from the field where Shungu’s team is training farmers on some of the apps that we have built for them. AL: From the buyer’s standpoint, what are the biggest risks in purchasing products from smallholder farmers? How does digital agriculture help to reduce those risks? MN: For me this is where it’s quite exciting. We’ve got one of the big food processing companies in South Africa buying $1Bn of commodities. They can do all the planning in the world, but they are always let down by the lack of information from growers. If the crop is going to be late, it impacts how they set up their processing plant and logistics. They don’t know until it’s too late. They were very clear to us that the ability to use independently verifiable information makes a huge difference to them. They want to manage their portfolio of suppliers using soil information, Arable Mark data, and farmer input. When we add in possibilities with the insurers and bankers, it becomes even more exciting. We are running a model with the Marks in Mozambique with an agro dealer selling seed, providing both the dealer and insurer weather data that validates Sentinel data. Instead of having general insurance, we have precision insurance. Currently, insurance will cover people within 4-5 microclimates receiving the same level of insurance, but they are not experiencing the same loss. The Arable Marks provide more specific information, allowing them to have better data and greater efficiency in the insurance system. AL: Solidaridad is a global network. What has your experience been in the Southern Africa region? MN: We’ve got a central office in Johannesburg, then have satellite offices with field staff that provide field support in Malawi, Zambia and Mozambique. We are driven by this one thing: the issues we are trying to solve are ancient. I spent time in a part of Zambia where there is massive deforestation because people harvest the trees to manufacture charcoal, which they then sell in the city for people needing energy. This is not the type of problem you can solve slowly: it’s urgent. Guess what one of the drivers is: agriculture is not paying farmers well, because their yields are sub-economic. At the basic level, they are applying fertilizer while not knowing what the soil needs; they don’t know the rainfall or the proper planting dates. The longer it takes to digitally enable these farmers, the longer we are going to have these deforestation issues. It’s not a ‘nice to have’ to play around with these Marks. It’s urgent. We can see the potential danger if agriculture does not change in Africa.

Securitizing Industry 4.0: The Next Revolution,Written by Augmate," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Augmate Follow -- 1 Listen Share By Mike Rogers, CPA, Digital Asset Advisor for Augmate Corporation. Industrial revolutions are profound periods of human ingenuity and rapid technological advancements, in which economic systems and social structures are transformed. The Third Industrial Revolution, called the “Digital Revolution,” was characterized by the digitization of data and widespread propagation of information. However, the Digital Revolution lacked adequate data security; digitized records were vulnerable to modification, deletion and theft. Today, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is underway, and emerging technologies, such as blockchain, are not only securing digital transactions, but also forming an entirely new ecosystem. This novel ecosystem’s core components include the Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and reimagined networks of shared computing services. Unprecedented advancements in communication and connectivity are generating an exponential quantity of data, renewing the need for security. Industry 4.0 technologies are expediting the creation of a more secure data-driven digital ecosystem. Augmate is harnessing the power of IoT, blockchain, and AI to provide our users with device-to-device intelligence and enhanced human-to-machine connectivity. Augmate Connect, built from the ground up for IoT and wearables, is a next-generation device management platform that reduces the threat of endpoint vulnerability and hacking. Our technologies are contributing to a disruptive movement transforming business operations worldwide. The velocity of disruptive innovation is accelerating across all industries due to digital transformation. Customer-oriented experiences are central to the digital economy, as data-enhanced services and products are becoming the new normal.

Steps I Took To Land My First Tech Internship,"Here are some steps I took to better myself as a candidate for a tech internship. Use this advice to land your first internship or job!,Attend Hackathons!,The Official 2019 Season North America Hackathon Schedule,Template,deedy/Deedy-Resume,Make your name easily visible,Include necessary information,Apply Apply Apply!,Written by Suprith Aireddy,Create an effective resume,Create a personal website,Conclusion"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Suprith Aireddy Follow DataDrivenInvestor -- Listen Share Getting your first internship is a big deal. It’s your foot in the door to your career in technology. This internship will help you tremendously to land your first job. After a year of developing my skills, I landed my first internship during my junior year of college. Now here are some things I did to better myself as a candidate. For those of you that lack experience or personal projects, this is the number one step I recommend. Hackathons are open, inclusive, environments for people of all developer levels to better their skills. It’s where you meet up form a team and create a solution. This solution can be anything your team wants to build. Hackathons are a place to learn from mentors and other like-minded people in your community. Attending a hackathon changed my life for the better. I learned more in the 36 hours of continuous coding than I did in 1 year of schooling. They helped me add projects to my resume and introduced me to potential employers. Also, they are completely free! Most of them even reimburse you for your travel needs. So what are you waiting for? mlh.io Click the above link before and sign up to as many as you can attend! Many candidates simply get overlooked or lost in the system because they don’t have an effective resume. Here are some things to consider when creating your resume. I use this template right here and it has given me the best results. It’s simple, elegant, and clean. I recommend this template but as long as your resume has those three characteristics you should be fine. github.com Recruiters have very little time to scan through the thousands of resumes they receive. By making your name big and bold, it will be very easy for them to remember who you are. This sounds simple but it’s very effective. Make your name the biggest thing on your resume. This is very simple. Remove anything on your resume that is not tech related. Remove the objective or summary. Recruiters tend to not read that at all. When listing previous experiences, highlight company names, positions and include graduation date. Important content should be higher up on the page. Again, use the template above for how to list information. Don’t make your resume a maze. Have clear outlined sections so that recruiters can see things without being overwhelmed. Include technical details. When listing experiences and projects, list things that you have impacted by your code. Did you improve run time by x amount? Give them quantified information. Having a personal website tells the recruiter that you are very passionate about coding. It shows them that you have the ability and skill to do things outside of a classroom setting. By creating a personal website you will stand out of the crowd and will be considered more than the other candidates. Getting your first gig is almost like a numbers game with a little bit of luck. When you don’t have the luxury of having a big network, it is very difficult to get interviews. That being said, I recommend you apply to as many job postings as you can. I applied to about 5–8 postings a day for about 2 straight months. I heard back from about 33% of them and was rejected without an interview for the rest. When applying, keep in mind to cater your resume to the job postings needs. Change your resume a little bit to better suit the posting and apply to jobs that are out of your comfort level. Keep in mind that most postings are just recommendations and not an end all be all application. Most recruiters look for students that are hard working and fast learners. They understand that you may not have all the skills needed and that is completely fine. Getting your first internship can be a struggle. However, with this advice, you will stand out from the crowd and will improve your chances of receiving your first offer!

Spiritual Technology — A white paper,Written by Mayank Agrawal," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Mayank Agrawal Follow -- Listen Share Introduction Delve into the best of 5000 year old, ‘spiritual technology’ based on unparalleled wisdom of authentic yoga practices and scriptures. Understand it’s practical relevance today and find solutions for our biggest problems in the modern world. While living in this glamorous material world, we remain fascinated and frustrated at the same time. Therefore, its important for us to be able to open a spiritual window to rejuvenate with fresh air of transcendental bliss. The intended goal is to describe this window, which is covered by drapes of ignorance and conditioning, these drapes can be opened by process of Yoga and then light of transcendental knowledge and spiritual bliss shines through. The ‘spiritual technology’ was at it’s peak few thousand years back. It was highly developed and prevalent in practice. It was called ‘Yoga’ because it culminated the entire lifestyle of an Vedic society. Yoga means union of everything. Hence Yoga is the process, which defines and inculcates, every action a person (a Yogi) performs both individually and collectively as a member of an elite Yogic society. Using this spiritual technology humans had created a pristine civilization which lived in complete harmony with nature. Everyone had abundance of satisfaction and happiness. The technology in itself was sufficient in providing a long fulfilling and healthy life. It tapped into fulfilling the real needs of all living beings. It extracted from human beings their inherent sense of goodness and morality, via practical actions that suited the circumstances of their particular time and place. History and Background Like many great modern nations or civilizations of the past were formed under the leadership of great men. For example, United States of America became a great a nation after a few learned, highly intellectual and good meaning men came together and signed the constitution of this country. Similarly, in India many thousand of years back, a great culture based on solely around spirituality was developed. It was built with the instructions and examples of great Saints who were extreme Yogis in their own right. They were also learned, intelligent and highly self realized. The key differentiating factor of these magnificent Saints, was that they were very advanced in spiritual knowledge. There were always the others, who were Yogis and had done severe austerities to attain esoteric mystic powers. But the Saints were not interested in mystic powers. They were aware of the absolute truth and principles of eternal religion. They were brought up in an environment where they went through the Yogic practices of meditation and scriptural studies, while maintaining a very simple and sober lifestyle. Hence they had developed the knowledge and determination to do the right thing. They could then also concentrate on the right thing for many long hours without flickering. They had developed the right desire from within their heart and were only eager for welfare of all living entities. Above all they knew who the Supreme God is and how to work in harmony with his plans. With these qualifications these Saints developed Yogic processes for different classes of people to achieve perfection. And the entire society including the ruling class functioned under the direct guidance of the Saints. Hence, everyone was happy and satisfied. The general people were very active while performing their prescribed duties but they were never anxious. They never lamented nor worried about success or failure. The basic tenant of how this is possible can be understood, by understanding the desires of all living beings. At a very basic level, we have five ‘senses organs’ (eyes, nose, mouth, ears and sense of touch), and the there are unlimited ‘sense objects’ (like delicious food, fragrances, music, movies, sports, clubs, intercourse etc) that we enjoy via our sense organs. Mind is actually considered the sixth sense organ and with sense objects like thoughts, feelings, ideas, knowledge, philosophy, humor, sense of goodness etc. Ultimately, everyone wants to be happy and enjoy, this tendency is inherent in our nature. And we derive happiness while enjoying one or more sense objects perceiving them through our senses and finally enjoying them in our mind and intelligence. This process of happiness is called ‘sense gratification’. Happiness or pleasure derived through sense gratification is aways very temporary. A lot of hard labour is also needed to enjoy these fleeting pleasures. A real life situation everyone can relate to, is the family time or gathering with friends that we set aside to be happy with them. If the plans and activities in such family gatherings or outing with friends or just vacations are carefully scrutinized. One can see that they all revolve around different activities of sense gratification. To list a few common ones; dinner plans, intoxication, gossiping, intellectual yet non-sensical discussions, watching movies and late night drama activities. We often allow ourselves some extra freedom in such occasions and often cross self set limits on enjoying one or the other sense gratification. The Saints and people in general of the Vedic civilization understood this concept really well. They knew that such temporary happiness is useless. They understood that sense gratification is only source of anxiety and distraction from the real purpose of life. The Vedic knowledge clearly declares that this material world (even though very real), is temporary and a place full of miseries. It is impossible to be find true uninterrupted happiness and state of bliss in this material world. Whatever pleasures we find will always be short lived. Fortunately, the Vedic knowledge also explains what is true happiness and the different process (Yogic paths) to achieve them. And ultimately how to achieve the real goal of human life. This process is called as ‘Self Realization’. Hence, knowing both; firstly the fallacies of the material world which dishes out many sense objects for sense gratification to keep us falsely engaged; and second the process (spiritual technology) of achieving true happiness; the Vedic civilization was established. This enabled them to collectively achieve the real purpose of human life. This pristine spiritual knowledge (technology) via revered ancient scriptures and via some extremely potent Yogic practices are still very well preserved. But they are generally hidden under the sloth of modern materialism and various variety of crap. Yet, for those who by good fortune or karma, find authentic Yogic practices find them extremely profound. And hence such intelligent people across the world, are immersing their lives in spirituality (Yoga) and deriving huge benefits. There are numerous practical applications of spiritual knowledge and Yoga processes for this day and age. The Supreme God and his Creations Its very important to talk about the concept of God in the very beginning. It is firmly believed just like how you might believe in gravity, that the Vedic Spiritual Knowledge has directly disseminated from God. There is one Supreme God who is the Creator, Maintainer and Destroyer of this Universe and of all living entities. All living beings are his fragmental parts and he is the best well wisher and benefactor of everyone. Like, every big successful company has one awesome CEO who calls the shots, but there are other leaders like department heads, presidents, directors, managers etc. These other leaders are working very hard and making critical decisions and executing the overall strategy made by the CEO for success of the company. Ultimately, the company was founded by the CEO, he makes the rules and he is the one running the company. Similarly, there is one CEO, of this universe and of all other universes and he is the Supreme God. There are other Demigods who are responsible for different departments of this universe. They are opulent and powerful, and can also bestow upon living beings a lot of material benefits. But they are also ‘created’ by the ‘creator’ the Supreme God. And their lifespan is also temporary like other living beings. Hence, one should not confuse the identity of the one and only Supreme God because of multitude of many religions and other Demigods. In India, there so many celebrated and worshipped, so-called God and Goddesses and millions of temples with many deities. Hence, there are many different faiths and religious institutions, within the Hindu religion itself. This is because of two main reasons. Firstly, a big percentage of the population(almost everyone), have not read and/or understood the Vedic Literature and hence they believe what they have learned from local culture and events growing up. Ultimately, basing their beliefs on their own mental speculation. Secondly, it’s a fact that the Demigods can and do fulfill the mundane material desires of their devotees when they are pleased, that too quickly. Thus affirming the faith of their devotees further. But the Demigods are subsidiary of Supreme God and work under his direction. The Demigods are masters of their own domain, but they are unable to bestow the ‘highest benediction’ possible for a living being. Whereas, the Supreme God is the most powerful and benevolent and can fulfill all desires of his devotees including the highest possible destination. The Demigods and the universes (including all the living beings) that they help maintain are ultimately annihilated at the end of the current cycle. They merge back into the creator, the Supreme God and hence they are all temporary. They are manifested again at the beginning of the next cycle, but the Supreme God remains unaffected, unchanged and eternal. Well what’s the highest possible benediction and how is it better or different from all the success, riches, pleasures and comforts that this material world has on offer. One might think, the highest benediction is, to go heaven, which is perceived as a super awesome and auspicious place with no misery and full of heavenly enjoyment. Heavens are real and can be obtained but they are certainly not the highest benediction. Similarly, obtaining what this material world is offering, is possible for one who endeavors very hard and is serious about his desires. Based on their sacrifices and hard work the Demigods bestow these offerings more of as a matter of universal law, than mercy. The Demigods get pleased by sincere prayers and efforts of their devotees. Therefore, even sinful and wicked people can temporarily enjoy this material world, sometimes to a great extent. But these material riches are always accompanied by anxiety, fear and misery. Life here is a see-saw of oscillating happiness and sadness, just like the eternal cycle of summer and winter seasons. Hence, the highest benediction is beyond the best riches of this material world and it is beyond the wondrous promises of heaven. It is the final destination of all living beings, it is full of sublime knowledge and bliss and it is permanent. It’s completely free from dualities (pleasure and pain) of the material world. It’s full with transcendental emotions and complete understanding of the Supreme God and our own Self. This is the ultimate goal of all spiritual knowledge and Yoga processes. The key point here is, we are all brothers and sisters having the same great grand father, who is the creator of all living beings. Like, Sun bestows its rays and warmth on everyone equally. Similarly, living entities are like the effulgent rays, emanating from the creator, the Supreme God. As he is the Supreme, he is known by many names (or religions), but the creator is one, viz., the Supreme God is one and eternal. There is no capitalism in the divine factory where living beings are produced, there is indeed monopoly and only one Supreme God is directly and indirectly, manufacturing a very wide variety of living beings and material worlds. Basic Tenants of the Absolute Truth Lets try to fit together a coherent framework, using which we can begin, to delve into the core principles of this ancient wisdom. These can be thought of as pillars and beams supporting, this most gigantic and magnificent building of Vedic knowledge. The basic tenants are enumerated, as we have an inherent need to sort and count. First tenant forms the basis and demarcates the two worlds; material and spiritual. Tenant two through six, explain the material world and our connection with it. The final tenants seven through eleven explain the spiritual world. The goal here is to introduce these concepts and get an understanding of the big picture. These will certainly get you thinking. On the other hand, for sake of conciseness some concepts are not be explained in detail. These tenants are spokes of the wheel of the Absolute Truth, the central part of the wheel, along with the whole wheel itself would get revealed in thorough reading of these concepts. 1>> The world and everything in it can be divided into two broad categories; spiritual and material. The world that we know and experience everyday is the material world. The material world is endless and full of alluring temptations. Material world keep us engaged one way or other. The spiritual world on the other hand is well hidden, it cannot be perceived by mundane senses and intelligence. The spiritual world is eternal, blissful and our original nature and source. And now that we are somehow or the other in the material world. We must use this life to prepare for going back to the spiritual world. 2>> Our body, as we know it, is temporary. This body is a machine, which is housing the Eternal Soul (the real us) for brief time period. At the time of death the Soul transmigrates from current body to the next body. 3>> Our present body and situation is a direct consequence of our past karma(activities) and desires in this life and previous lifetimes. 4>> Its very challenging to be able to see things as they really are. This because we are under a strong entanglement of illusion (called maya). The starting point of this illusion is our bodily concept of life, where we consider our body and everything connected with this body (like family, religion, gender, state, nation etc.) as our own. And everything else as separate (or as others). 5>> It is not only very difficult to be happy for a short time in this world. But it’s impossible, to sustain any kind of happiness permanently and to avoid misery in this world. Hence, by any amount of hard work or extreme endeavors, it is impossible to reach a state of complete happiness or satisfaction. 6>> The material world and living entities within it are controlled by external energy of the Supreme God. This external energy (also called Maya), is the bewildering agency, which keeps us engaged in the material world. The external energy conducts itself via three modes of material nature called gunas, viz.goodness (sattva), passion (rajas) and ignorance (tamas). All moving and non-moving things having varying degrees of these modes. And that is how they are being conditioned. 7>> There is one Supreme God. He has an eternal blissful spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin and He is the prime cause of all causes. (Brahma Samhita 5.1) 8>> Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice and a predominant rise of irreligion — at that time Supreme Godhead descends himself (incarnates among living beings residing on material planets). (Bhagavad Gita 4.7) 9>> Depending upon the time and situation, the Supreme God, tunes his incarnation (or avatar) to deliver perfectly, the living beings (who are willing to hear his message) of all miseries and misfortune. This tuning means, that the God does not have to descend on our planet with his full entourage of powers, as only a portion of his powers are sufficient in most millenniums. This means, a plenary portion of Supreme God, takes form of a divine being and lives among the people. 10>> The incarnations of the Lord are innumerable, like rivulets flowing from inexhaustible sources of water. (Srimad Bhagavatam 1.3.26) 11>> The wonderful, liberating and impossible activities performed by God when he descends on our planet. Not only relieve the burden of evil from the Earth. But also helps man to understand what lies beyond this material world and to believe in transcendental spiritual nature of the world and it’s limitless possibilities. These eleven tenants will help in realizing the journey one can take from the mundane and temporary materialism to pure bliss and illumination of spirituality. Utmost Relevance of Spiritual Technology Today In this age most of us feel, the balance of our lives is slightly (or a lot) tipped in the wrong direction. Hence, even fortunate people with health and wealth are meandering around looking for happiness. All they find are, temporary pleasures which are directly or indirectly related to sense gratification. Absence of miseries is falsely considered as happiness. We also develop a deep rooted attachment with people and objects through which we get these temporary pleasures. Attachment also fosters a strong defense mechanism, which totally disregards any idea that suggests that the objects of our attachment may not be worth it (or there could be something much more worthwhile than we have been running after). This helps us to agree, that even amidst the many riches of material comforts and available pleasure or happiness options, there hardly any hope for permanent happiness and sense of complete satisfaction. By nature everyone is ultimately looking for happiness but they are not finding it to their heart’s satisfaction. The reason for this is that we have completely lost touch with our spiritual nature and our soul. The culture and knowledge of spiritual technology which could enable us to reenter the realm of spirituality, has been discarded, degraded and manipulated. There is unbounded happiness viable for anyone who taps into spirituality with sincere efforts. But this is lost on us. This is not only an individual’s self help problem. Rather, it is much more grave and encompassing, as our society, world governments and schools, research and science and our fantasies for future are completely relying on material technology and only looking for material temporary happiness. There is no inclusion of spirituality in any real plan that people actually would execute. Spirituality is often clubbed into either religion or religious sentiment, sense of goodness (charity or philanthropy) or some form physical circus Yoga (or mediation). Religions and religious practices have been marginalized, not paid attention to and in general people have no proper understanding of even their own religion. To conclude, in material world there is no happiness at all. There is just the futile attempt to get rid of the miseries, and temporary cessation of misery is falsely called happiness. Since our education, society, nation or current fashion discards spirituality and there is no hope of finding true happiness with materialism, we are actually doomed in this lifetime. The problem is at a much macro level as we are collectively churning away at materialism with full energy and focus. The best scientists and biggest companies of the world are working to find new sophisticated ways of bringing out more and more of material comfort, pleasure, ease of life and longevity of human life. Hence, the best of the world are only engaged materially. At best, they are engaged in philanthropic activities, which only help to solve relatively smaller problems and their solutions only work for sometime. To date, there is not even a single working solution for grave world problems like mass violence, mass hunger or global warming. Take a moment, and think about this, nobody thus far has a working solution, among; top notch scientific research, engineering endeavors, Nobel prize winners or best philosophers or economists or great governments. The best solutions we have are helping us to just survive and delay the inevitable. They provide a cushion or decrease the amount of misery. They materially enrich and empower a few more humans every year. They provide new profound ways for sense gratification for temporary pleasures. They are nice. But, they aren’t permanently solving any grave world problem by its root cause. They are not providing us with a nurturing society full of happiness and free from all fear. They are not taking us where we need to go. Herein lies the utmost importance of spiritual technology. It will help us open drapes of ignorance and help us experience the missing spiritual bliss which is mind-bogglingly awesome. It can help teach the society as whole on how to live in harmony with nature and with all living beings. It shows the path of how not put our self interest at the center of our lives but how to keep the Supreme God at the center and with that have compassion for all living beings. It is possible to lead a full meaningful and blissful life in this way. Spirituality is the only hope to achieve the real goal of human life. The ultimate possibilities of spirituality attained via appropriate Yoga practice(spiritual technology), is best summarized in four verses of Bhagavad Gita: “In the stage of perfection called trance, or samādhi, one’s mind is completely restrained from material mental activities by practice of Yoga. This perfection is characterized by one’s ability to see the Self by the pure mind and to relish and rejoice in the Self. In that joyous state, one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness, realized through transcendental senses. Established thus, one never departs from the truth, and upon gaining this he thinks there is no greater gain. Being situated in such a position, one is never shaken, even in the midst of greatest difficulty. This indeed is actual freedom from all miseries arising from material contact.” (Bhagavad Gita 6.20–23) As per this description, before we can obtain “boundless transcendental happiness” there are two difficult to overcome prerequisites. Firstly, we must be able to restrain the mind completely from material mental activities. Along the same lines, the revered Yoga Sutras gives a very brief definition of Yoga — “Yoga is the cessation of movements in the consciousness” (Yoga Sutras 1.2). This helps to bring the mind in a pure state of consciousness. Secondly, using this purified mind we must be able to see the Self. In simple terms this means having the awareness that we are actually not this body or mind, but we are the eternal blissful soul. The soul is currently under the covering of this gross body that see and the subtle body made of mind, intelligence and false ego. At the time of death in the present body the soul will transmigrate to another body. The soul is always accompanied in all our (and that of others) past, present and future bodies by the supersoul which is a feature of Supreme personality of Godhead. The supersoul is our best well wisher, and divine portion of God himself. To perceive the soul, the supersoul and the knowledge of soul’s subordinate but divine connection with supersoul and Supreme God is the ability to see the Self. This certainly looks like a pretty tall order. This is similar to a child aspiring to become a neurosurgeon would see the process of actually becoming one as daunting. But, if the child sincerely works with determination through the long arduous process of the medical education (that too neurological), he can certainly become a neurosurgeon. Hence, in Yoga or spirituality as well, one just has to follow the bona-fide process with sincere hard work and determination. And then, all the limitless possibilities of spirituality and reaching the perfect state of trance, become achievable. A well known saying goes — “the change begins with us”. It’s actually very true. Each responsible person must endeavor to become perfect by applying spiritual technology. And the more such people we have in the world the more real positive impact they can make towards emphatically solving all the big problems of the world from their root cause. Breakdown of Spiritual Technology (what is it?) One easy way to understand any technology, is to list down ‘practical components’ compromising the technology. To further the understanding, one then can delve into the ‘interaction between components’ and ‘how they jell together’ to deliver the technology. For example lets look at the automobile manufacturing technology which has been around for 150 years, its pretty mature and advanced. Everyone can relate to cars including children. Most of us can explain (in varying degrees of detail) how they are made and delivered to us? This is my take on it. This technology consists of these practical components; graphical car design, concept car design testing, acquiring of raw material or smaller parts, factory with assembly line to put it all together and finally transportation to send it out to world markets. Its intuitive to visualize how these components interact together and ultimately keep producing and distributing thousands of cars. Repeating this exercise for spiritual technology, here is the list of its practical components: These seven components and their interactions, constitute the spiritual technology. Among these, the Supreme God is eternal and ever present. Supreme God is the creator and source of the remaining six components. These spiritual components are the supreme mercy of God and created by him to help the conditioned and suffering living beings to move from material world to spiritual world, in order to experience complete uninterrupted bliss. Spiritual knowledge explains in detail all the components of spiritual technology and how it works. Spirituality gets a great foundation, when there exists a human civilization which is based on spiritual principles. The great Indian civilization that has existed from thousands of years and has always fostered spirituality over material development, is therefore the world headquarters of spirituality(or Yoga). This civilization then produces great spiritual teachers(guru), who are well versed in the science of spirituality and can teach it to aspiring and deserving practitioners, the Yogis. The spiritual master, is a master of one or more Yoga processes and is himself a devout practitioner and he never wavers from spiritual principles. He teaches the Yoga process to his disciples based upon the exact spiritual knowledge he had received from his own spiritual master and by reading revered scriptures under his guidance. The disciples gradually develop into budding Yoga practitioners, become well versed with spiritual knowledge and start tapping into the unbounded spiritual bliss. At this stage they start developing an understanding of Supreme God, his creations, the material illusion and real goal of human life. Slowly, the seed of love for Supreme God germinates and they start experiencing transcendental emotions. Ultimately, steadfast and fully determined Yogis achieve the supreme destination which is the eternal spiritual abode of Supreme God. Yogis who remain unsuccessful in achieving this highest goal are born again in material world, but are well equipped to continue on their spiritual journey. Taking a more broader look and going back to history, its clear that this whole world is working based on spiritual technology. In Bhagavad Gita while describing the science of Yoga(spiritual technology) — “The Personality of Godhead, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, said: I instructed this imperishable science of Yoga to the sun-god, Vivasvān, and Vivasvān instructed it to Manu, the father of mankind, and Manu in turn instructed it to Ikṣvāku” (verse 4.1). This is a clear indication that Sun, was instructed in the science of Yoga at the beginning of creation. And hence Sun is a perfect Yogi. Sun is never even a microsecond late in rising or setting, it never falls short of changing seasons and providing just the right amount of energy for sustenance of life on Earth. This spiritual technology was then also taught to the first kings and progenitors in disciplic succession. And hence it is also the basis of human civilization. The basis of this ‘science of Yoga’ or ‘spiritual technology’ is the transcendental knowledge derived from the great Vedic scriptures perfectly preserved from past more than 5000 years. This knowledge is best described in as — “Transcendental knowledge in relation with the Supreme God is knowledge resulting in the complete suspension of the waves and whirlpools of the material modes. Such knowledge is self-satisfying due to its being free from material attachment, and being transcendental it is approved by authorities. Who could fail to be attracted?” (Srimad Bhagavatam 2.3.12) To further substantiate the understanding of this knowledge we look at three types of knowledge as described in Bhagavad Gita (verses 18.20–22). These are based on the three modes of material nature and the best form of knowledge is in mode of goodness and and then it degrades for the other two modes (passion is better than ignorance). Ultimately, transcendental knowledge is even beyond the mode of goodness and hence called transcendental. This knowledge is the gateway to achieve ultimate perfection (full knowledge, full bliss) in human life. This breakdown of spiritual technology, would have hopefully helped in building a 10,000 feet picture.

The Dance Between Certifications and Self-Learning as a Technologist,Written by Rich Stewart," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Rich Stewart Follow DataDrivenInvestor -- Listen Share I have chosen to own my certifications as a Technologist by paying for every one of them that mattered to me. I never waited for or had a sense of entitlement that my employer should pay for them. Over the past 16 years I have earned an alphabet soup of certifications including PMP, ITIL, CSM, CSPO, CSP, and SPC. Only the ITIL foundation certification was sponsored by a former employer, as they were offering it to all of their IT staff. At specific strategic points in my career I have leveraged my certifications to land key jobs that furthered my career. So, I certainly understand that certifications can help a candidate land a job. With so many candidates applying for positions, often a specific certification on a resume can make the difference between an application being considered or rejected based on specific filters. This can be especially important in certain technology areas where a very challenging certification demonstrates extensive knowledge and experience. Some great examples include the CISSP security certification and the CBAP certification for business analysts. While certifications can play a role in getting considered for a job, many of them demonstrate little more than initiative. For example, consider the two first-level Agile certifications offered by Scrum Alliance: Certified ScrumMaster (CSM) and Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO). The CSM is obtained by attending a two-day course (by a Certified Scrum Trainer) and then passing an easy 40-question test. The CSPO is even easier. It is obtained merely by attending a two-day course taught by a Certified Scrum Trainer. Don’t get me wrong. I took both of these courses and they were valuable to me. I have used material from each course, taught by very experienced and respected trainers, in subsequent roles as an Agile practitioner. What I’m saying here is that because certifications such as these don’t require one to already be a practitioner and to demonstrate working knowledge, the value in having them on your resume is that they show you took initiative and invested in yourself. That is a positive and I’m happy to acknowledge that obtaining the CSM helped me land my first full-time Scrum Master role. Having said that, I don’t plan to renew my current certifications or pursue any new ones in the foreseeable future. Why? It’s actually pretty simple. I’ve spent the past five years working as an Agile practitioner in the role of Scrum Master and/or Agile Coach. During that time, I’ve gained a wealth of hands-on experience working with Agile teams, Product Owners, and other supporting roles. I’ve delivered extensive training (including the equivalent of the two-day CSM and CSPO courses) internally with my current company, IHS Markit. I’ve also coached many individuals and teams to help them mature in their Agile roles. In short, I’ve gained much more experience than any certification could properly express. But that’s just one of the reasons I am not pursuing more certifications. The other key reason is that I make time for deliberate practice every single week. Deliberate practice refers to highly-concentrated learning, and many successful professionals claim the associated five-hour rule of concentrated learning per week is the key to their success. I am very fortunate because I have a boss who practices and fully supports the five-hour rule for his team. However, while we carve out time for deliberate practice during working hours, our passion for our profession means we also choose to do highly-concentrated learning during non-working hours. As a case in point, I’m writing most of this article on New Year’s Day 2019. And if you don’t think writing is deliberate practice, you need to give it a try. Writing is a great exercise to synthesize prior learnings and to gain new insights. Whether you choose to publish and share your writings with others is secondary. The biggest mistake a professional can make is to not invest in their continued learning. The world is changing at a dazzlingly fast pace and we all know that pace is increasing. So why would anyone choose not to invest in oneself to ensure their skills and knowledge remain current, relevant, and marketable? I can only think of three reasons. 1. A person doesn’t have enough passion for what they do to want to learn more. 2. A person feels their employer owes them the training and therefore they shouldn’t have to invest in themselves with time or money. 3. A person is performing well in their current job and is satisfied with how their career is progressing. Let’s break these down. #1. If you don’t have enough passion for continuous learning, that’s a sure sign you need to consider doing something else. Unfortunately, until you’ve actually found your passion, it’s hard to have the perspective of what it feels like to feel really passionate about something. I managed a traditional project management office for nearly five years before becoming an Agile practitioner. While I was successful, I never felt a real passion in that role. I didn’t spend hours each week building on the baseline of knowledge I gained from earning the Project Management Professional (PMP) certification. If I’d have had the perspective then that I do now, I would have sought alternative career directions much sooner. #2. Entitlement is never a winning formula. Employers invest in their employees to widely varying degrees. Moreover, what employers typically do is pay for some one-time training for select employees. That’s not much better than getting another certification. The real lasting and deep learning comes from deliberate practice. You have to own the negotiation with your manager to get regular time each week for learning. If they are unwilling to do so, that tells you all you need to know about your manager and/or employer. It’s time to invest in yourself with deliberate practice on your own time to find a better manager and/or employer. #3. It’s easy to get comfortable with using specific skills, especially if your employer is happy with the job you’re doing. However, technology evolves very quickly, and chances are if you’re using the same technologies you were using five years ago, your skills are dated. One day you’re likely to wake up and find yourself marginalized at best or laid off at worst. As a technologist, never be satisfied with your level of skill and expertise with the technologies you have mastered. If I find myself interviewing for a new job someday as an Agile practitioner and am not offered the job because my certifications aren’t current, how will I respond? I will thank that prospective employer for their candor and will consider myself fortunate for dodging a bullet of joining a company with the wrong mindset. If they value a piece of paper more than demonstrable expertise and experience, they are not a company I’d want to join. Key Takeaways Leverage certifications for specific purposes to further your career at key points. Leverage your ability to reinvent yourself through deliberate practice to further your continual growth and to become a leading technology professional in your field. -- -- DataDrivenInvestor Business agility solutions consultant.

Lessons From the Immigrant Hustle: Ronit Avni,"What’s your name, company name, and title?,Which country did you emigrate from?,What was the most difficult thing you faced when you arrived in the US?,What was your very first job?,Why did you choose to become an entrepreneur? (c.f. What triggered you?).,Why do you think you have been successful?,What advice do you have for newly arrived immigrants that want to pursue the path of entrepreneurship?,Written by Amine Rahal"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Amine Rahal Follow -- Listen Share Ronit Avni, Localized Inc., Founder & CEO. Canada, from Montreal. Adjusting from having a recession mentality to an abundance-driven one. I left Quebec which was going through a deep recession that lasted many years and so you had to take whatever job you could find — today that is no longer the case but there were no jobs when I was growing up. In the U.S., you could be more ambitious and more creative if you set your mind to it, but it required shifting to an abundance mentality that allowed you to dream. Outside of college where I had a variety of jobs, I worked at the human rights organization, WITNESS.org, because I wanted to fuse documentary filmmaking and human rights work. This was at a time when YouTube didn’t yet exist (nor did digital cameras). WITNESS was the first group to envision the ubiquitous presence of cameras, and their potential for social transformation if held by human rights defenders. Peter Gabriel, the musician, conceived of the idea while traveling to South Africa in the 1980s. I joined in 2000 and got hooked on the role that media and technology could play in effecting change. It wasn’t a conscious choice at first — I would see a gap, look around to see who was filling it, and if there was someone doing so effectively in ways that interested me professionally or creatively or ethically I would join them (in the case of WITNESS, my first job), and if there wasn’t, I’d endeavor to do so directly. That happened both with my first organization, Just Vision, and again with my company, Localized. How did you raise the money necessary to launch your business? (e.g. did you find an investor? Did you borrow from the bank? Did you save money by working a 9 to 5? Please tell us your story). With my first organization, a media/educational nonprofit, I secured a fellowship that allowed me to then slowly raise philanthropic dollars to build out our team. Our first donation was $2500 and that seemed like a lifeline then. I slept on the floor on a mattress in my office for months and gave up my bedroom to a fellow colleague while we worked on our first film. Slowly the organization built a base of supporters and grew to an international team. We produced films and a news site and grew. In the case of our new company, Localized, it has been a painstaking process of fundraising. First through professional acquaintances who know that our team is true to our word, and now from seasoned investors. It is ongoing as we are still an early-stage company with a mix of angel investors and institutional ones. My co-founder Ariadne Papagapitos and I have done some consulting on the side so we could run lean. With a musician parent, you learn creative persistence in the face of financial uncertainty and develop a tolerance for risk. Perhaps some combination of stubbornness, risk tolerance, and the ability to weave between communities and cultures. Check out resources like Unshackled Ventures. Start your company in school if you can. Secure more runway than you think you need. -- -- Tech Entrepreneur and Contributor on several publications, Amine is best known as the CEO of IronMonk Solutions, a New York based digital marketing agency.

Channel Transaction Processing,Written by TrinityProtocol," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in TrinityProtocol Follow Trinity Protocol -- Listen Share The channel transaction task comes from the TP (Trinity Off-chain Protocol) message. In order to better understand the message processing flow and working mode of the task, this section starts from the basic characteristics, mutual exclusion, orderliness of state channel transactions, and creates and forms the conventions that the Trinity system needs to follow. These conventions will be a fundamental criterion for the design of the Trinity system architecture. Below are the basic characteristics of state channel transactions: • State channel transactions require one or several mutex to guarantee the synchronization of transactions on both sides; • A transaction with the signature by both parties is a valid transaction (VT); • The trigger condition of the on-going transaction is: the previous transaction is a valid transaction (VT); • Semi-valid transactions (SVT) require re-signature, otherwise channel transactions will be blocked; • The benchmark balance of the n transaction is the channel balance of both parties after the completion of the n-1 transaction; • The n valid transaction and the n+1 transaction are considered to be the same transaction (in the case that the network communication sequence may result in packet loss); • The latest transaction can punish all other transactions (except for the transactions to close channels fast and the previous transaction); • Channel transactions should be aggregatable (to improve the performance and throughput of channel transactions). Simple Mathematical Model of the Channel Transactions: As it is shown in the graph, only one transaction at one time will be acknowledged and performed by both peers. To guarantee the mutually exclusiveness, Trinity observe rules in the following convention: • Two parties of the channel and their respective roles：Founder Peer and Partner Peer； • One transaction has a sole identifier (denoted by nonce)； • Classify channel transactions：special transactions and general transactions； ◦ Special transactions: creating channels (nonce=1) and swift settlement of the transactions in the channel (nonce=0). ◦ General transactions: other transactions (RSMC / HTLC): nonce >= 2. • Founder peer generate a solely identifier and a serial number for every transaction. • Partner peer verify, negotiate and reset the sole identifier.

From the Deli to Data Science,Written by Joseph Santos," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Joseph Santos Follow -- 1 Listen Share When you grow up you tend to think that anything is possible. When I was 4 my grandmother bought me VHS tapes of Carl Sagan’s Cosmos (dubbed in Spanish). Back then I believed him when he said “…The open road still softly calls, like a nearly forgotten song of childhood.” As I grew older, however, my dreams became more like holograms, visible, yet never truly in reach. Throughout high school my grades slowly declined as I began having terrible panic attacks. I would hide my face in my books, in a primordial cycle of fight or flight with no danger present. It became exhausting and some days I opted to not go to school at all. I distanced myself from my friends and became less and less sure of whether I had a future worth pursuing. I worked in a deli and regardless of how polite or how disciplined I was, I would always be treated as almost a competent human being. I had a boss snap his fingers at me, and while most customers were a delight some customers called me boy or asked “where are you from?” knowing they didn’t want to know which street I lived on. My mother and father came from harsher backgrounds than me, yet they seemed to have turned out fine, My mother went from the ghettos to becoming a Navy veteran who graduated 2nd in her class in Airmen school, and my father went from the ghettos to owning his own house at 21. Me, I hadn’t even graduated college yet and couldn’t even seem to be able to go a few days without panic attacks or feelings of depression. The day my life would change was after a particularly rough attack. I was hiding under my pillow, shaking, the room moving around me. Tears rolling down my cheeks. I looked at the first texts I had sent to the woman I would later make my wife. I told her that I promised her a life of adventure, excitement, and new experiences all the time. I had let her down. But I didn’t feel my usual indifference and sadness. Instead I felt anger. Angry that I always had to decline going to parties with too many people or where there wasn’t an adequate exit strategy. Quitting sports because of dizziness. No. I would no longer run. I would spend the next week on google scholar for hours, looking at research on depression and anxiety. I scoured articles of cures and natural remedies. I began taking Omega-3–6–9 pills, creating a diet plan entirely centered around the reduction of anxiousness, cutting caffeine entirely out of my diet and finding strategies to cope with my illness. I left the trenches and ran out into the front lines. I learned about precision medicine and began reading extensively on this field called machine learning and medical imaging. As I said it in my head, “medical data science” I knew I had found my passion. As I took more of a calculated approach towards fighting depression and anxiety, I began learning how to code, and I noticed that I hadn’t had a panic attack in months. I quickly picked it up and began taking advanced maths and programming courses at my college. My first machine learning course was Andrew NGs course on machine learning From there I would take everything from Coursera, Udemy, Jeremy Howard’s fastai deep learning courses and MIT OpenCourseWare courses to build up the spots where I was lacking. Anything that could get me closer to my new realized dream: a world without mental illness. A smarter, data-driven world. A world without people silently waging mental wars and feeling there are no reinforcements coming. After I felt okay with my coding ability I applied to 10 jobs a week for months and went to a few hackathons. My team ended up winning 2nd place. Things were heating up. It would be after 44 jobs rejecting me with passive statements of “while you stood out, we’ve decided to go with other applicants at this time”, that I would finally get an interview with one company; An engineering insurance company. I was now a data science intern. Wow. This was not like the deli. The developers and engineers drank cocktails with the CEO while their new building addition was completed. I was surrounded by people 10 times smarter than I was yet, they all treated me so well. I felt at home. It didn’t matter where I was from or that I was an intern and not a permanent employee. Reflecting on everything, going from a deli in a small town to a data science position in a large city, I realized that the most dangerous place to be is not the streets or untraveled avenues. Those are all the resources you have. The most dangerous place is in your comfort zone. Not being challenged is worse than being the worst in your field. Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly until you can achieve mastery and do it perfectly. If you don’t start, however, then you’ll never know. I also learned that depression is the largest exclusive club there is. Everyone feels like they’re the only one when in reality there are millions of people going through the same thing as you and I. There is greatness in all of us and we all have something to give; to our country, our community, and to our field. All we have to do is start and not listen to those that tell us we aren’t capable. That is the hardest part. -- -- 1 I am a data science lover and a student medical A.I. researcher studying machine learning applications for neurological and mental disorders Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*39TwOUBZSa-i2bYk3dhskw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*CB6Qim8hbdx2s-jUu39hEQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*KOcnxQz_0El-qLeRsSnecQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*KQzQAn6779Uixy2Rnh0idg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*T96sBu-BdBKNnz07IxpCsw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*fuQ69nWlAF-uvQ86296O6g.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*EImv62XUF5VbAJxJ3ZPbrA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*39TwOUBZSa-i2bYk3dhskw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*uri2j_XlzeDyfoPgKhY4Qg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*39TwOUBZSa-i2bYk3dhskw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*39TwOUBZSa-i2bYk3dhskw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:240:161/1*uri2j_XlzeDyfoPgKhY4Qg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/0*r4yjMpEmqzHCUvWC.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*bv2KUVNLi2sFNjBTdoBmWw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/0*zsngbTOmFCy6sUCx.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*swd_PY6vTCyPnsgBYoFZfA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*8sSAHftNwd_RNJ3k4VA0pA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*uNyD4yNMH-DnOel1wzxOOA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/0*3OsUtsnlTx9Svm4c.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*IPZF1hcDWwpPqOz2vL7NxQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*0fHUKyg3xtpNWpop35PR4g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*TQlEMeYwwWc38Wqm7EfCTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*0-N4JrXpZG1KJfIrAutd3A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*4_GghEnIlF5xV8ra', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*HwhGJJm9oaoyXnrCYPIXgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@josephsantos.edu?source=post_page-----9187f27dd096--------------------------------,11,5 min read
2019 Intentions: A Social Media Diet and Increased Socially Conscious Entrepreneurship,Written by Corey Coto," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Corey Coto Follow DataDrivenInvestor -- Listen Share Extremes are unhealthy because it creates unbalance and a lack of harmony in our body and mind. The real purpose of any diet is to give the practitioner a program to help them achieve balance and harmony in their life. A diet is so much more than what foods we put into our bodies it also encompasses the quality of information that we feed our mind. My Cuban Abuelita used to tell me and my sisters as children that we were either too “flacko” or “gordo.” Life is full of ups and downs like our weight. We will experience highs and low as we follow our programs and work to achieve our goals in 2019, but the determination to pick ourselves up when we fall is essential for achieving success. My goal in 2019 is to remain moderate in my use of social media and to start socially conscious businesses that as Marc Benioff says, create a positive impact in the world. In early 2016 and after much internal debate, I decided to delete my Facebook account and have never looked back. Deleting Facebook, while extreme, did not cause me to become a complete technology recluse but provided a significant social media creative constraint and enabled me to be more conscious and intentional with how I use platforms like Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, Yelp, and others. Quitting all social media for good is an extreme and unbalanced action. It is much better to learn how to practice moderation in our use of social media as it is a more sustainable path. We are living during the most significant technological revolution in human memory. Artificial Intelligence algorithms designed by a small group of very smart professions are affecting the lives of billions of people around the world. I believe that it is time for more voices from underrepresented groups in technology to be heard. For example, when I was writing the word ‘gordo’ on my iPhone, the Google Keyboard app autocorrected the word to Gordon. I don’t know anyone named Gordon in my community so why would Google AI leaders think ‘gordo’ was a typo for ‘Gordon’ if it wasn’t because for their algorithms are written by a group of mostly white men. Over the coming weeks, I plan to create two Public Benefit Corporations for new businesses that I have started using Gust Launch and Stripe Atlas which are the leading platforms for launching startups used by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. The first is a socially conscious business with my wife called Minht & Honey, and the other is an artificial intelligence business with a mission to create and promote trust on the Internet called Believability AI. I invite you to follow me on my journey starting here, and I ask all of you to consider going on a social media diet in 2019. Please let me know if you do and share your program. -- -- DataDrivenInvestor Artist, Scientist, and Explorer | Unified Physics Enthusiast | Startup Founder and Investor | Technology Executive | AmazonSmile Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/0*ki1D3pkQEDsymsLd', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*zmVei2N8q60j8f2FZ5aUFw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*v35b9eC1_ABNMKbKEqtLkw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*zmVei2N8q60j8f2FZ5aUFw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*x3ViWDpkfDxbqLeaGhJHig.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*zmVei2N8q60j8f2FZ5aUFw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*vcNoq0SDXBl7nqnzNaSr7A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*xiFRgHfgfMR7S111UB2hMw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*RQ6IU5ZQqoSQocDbSyjC0A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*6mgEZmtgEIYKM-aqXYAgMA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*8tXAhZrIHyMwUFzyVrhvgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*zmVei2N8q60j8f2FZ5aUFw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*vzu3JPzaq2EZKTZNY9BhLA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*lEmL62oZdrOOWIzAAFKiFg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*i2zLIwC9mftamP1dbciCeQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*F1Gh6B49T5oG6wc3W7j7pQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*k3GDSD7MLzd9t0OzpC8Slw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.comhttps://coreycoto.medium.com/?source=post_page-----818fcf7df4e1--------------------------------,268,3 min read

The Reality of Streaming Sports in Real Time,"What Exactly Is Live-Streaming?,How Can Live-Streaming Enhance Their Entire Sports Marketplace?,How Sponsorship will Play a Role,Written by Kathryn Kuchefski"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Kathryn Kuchefski Follow Instant Sponsor -- Listen Share We have all been there, Live-Streaming Sunday Night’s big game from our computer or smartphone and BOOM…we receive a text from a friend or social media alert about the big play that just happened. The only problem is, we are watching on an online platform, and our feed is on a 30-second delay… this leads to major spoiler alerts. Ugh. These inherent delays cause viewers to shy away from watching the big game on their computer or smartphone. Not only does this latency lead to poor viewing quality, but also the potential loss of consumers viewing content and sponsorships associated with the big game. This past year, Limelight Networks did a series of surveys exploring consumer opinions, insights, and behaviors surrounding digital content. How do individuals feel about the inherent delays in “Live-Streamed” Sporting Events? And the amazing thing is 59.3% of individuals globally still subscribe to one or more Streaming Video on Demand (SVOD) service. Individuals want the ability to watch their favorite team play, no matter the time or the place. With the growth of social media, it is essential for media outlets to understand the needs and wants of these consumers. Would they be more likely to subscribe to an online platform such as Twitch, Facebook Watch, Reddit, etc. if latency issues were fixed? And the overwhelming answer was yes. 59.5% of people said they would be more likely to watch live sports online if the streaming event had no delay from the live broadcast. And more than 65% of individuals 26–45 years of age would stream more sports online if the coverage was not delayed. The idea behind live-streaming is that when someone is streaming a sporting event on their device, they are using LTE (Long-Term Evolution), WiFi and Bluetooth. Broadcasters will pick-up signals from their device — a phone — which is called the edge and then pass it along to another edge (phone). This is called Edge-to-Edge transfer — carrier to my phone. And all carriers will communicate differently. Limelight Networks has worked to address this challenge having recently launched Limelight Real-time Video Streaming. The company is claiming their new technology will allow for a sub-second live streaming platform which enables organizations to live stream video from around the world in less than a second. However, the jury is still out on the validity of this new technology. So, stay tuned for more. Regarding viewing live sports and eSports, the goal of any online streaming company is to make the viewing experience more interactive and therefore more social. Broadcasters could potentially start to communicate with fans during the game through social media and live streams depending on the platform — this has been done before but not in real time. Think of it like an Instagram influencer communicating with fans via Instagram Live. Such capabilities will enable further opportunities for streaming companies to monetize their live video content. 60% of viewers would be more inclined to watch live sports online if they were streamed in real time. Distributors of live video and sports broadcasters need real-time live-streaming sub-second latency coverage to ensure an optimal viewing experience. The enhanced experience will not only increase viewership but also revenue. With more eyeballs on the ‘big game’, sponsorship should become even sought after. At this moment in time, there is a surplus in sports sponsorship inventory (signage at games, jersey patches, etc). Between 30–50% of sponsorship inventory can go unsold in a given season, depending on the circumstances around the rights holder. Instant Sponsor aims to improve the rights holders ability to sell their inventory, and at the same time allow for a more diverse group of sponsors to enter the sports marketing ecosystem. With sponsorship’s value increased due to living streaming, more brands will be seeking to sponsor teams and athletes. Instant Sponsors platform breaks down the barriers of entry and allows for the parties to interact seamlessly on a peer-2-peer network.

It’s not VoiceOver…It’s EarOver.,Written by Ed Cunningham," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Ed Cunningham Follow -- Listen Share To headphone or not to headphone. That is the question. Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the tangly mess that is the Sony MDR-7506 headphones, or take to take arms against a sea of aural self-indulgence, and by opposing, ditch the cans. If you’re new to voice over, you may have to get used to hearing yourself through headphones as you speak. This is tricky for some. It will often make beginners slow down and lose their natural talking rhythm; they’ll read in a one-word-at-a-time fashion, rather than read ahead and speak in phrases. Why doesn’t this happen to all voice actors who wear headphones? Their ear is above average. Not the cartilagey parts on the outside, best demonstrated by Alfred E. Newman. I’m talking about the intricate, delicate, hairy parts on the inside. People who master the art of voiceover have “a good ear” above all else. My first agent in Los Angeles was Steve Tisherman. A genius in many respects, he was the agent who developed and subsequently managed the talents of voiceover titan Don LaFontaine. You may remember Don’s gravelly voice serving up the words “In a World” a few thousand times in the 90s and 2000s, yes? Steve Tisherman said to me in our very first meeting, “You want to whisper your way to million bucks? It’s not voiceover. It’s earover.” Earover? That’s not very catchy, Steve. But, what can I say, I was 29 at the time and had no idea what the hell this Hollywood agent was saying to me. Who did he think he was talking to!? I was an actor. I had MFA training! I’d completed Arthur Lessac’s Kinesensic Training for the voice! I played Hamlet at Cambridge! (Or rather, Marc Antony at Chicago Shakepeare!) Who does this agent think he is, telling me how to perform narration? Fast forward sndfgsnjxh years… and yeah…I now understand the brilliance of Steve Tisherman. It IS earover, not voiceover. And the sooner you come to understand this, the sooner you’re on your way to that million bucks. “So…” you ask, “How do I develop a ‘good ear?’” The good news is, you probably already have one. In fact, you probably have two. The bad news is, you must be a consumer in the market that you wish to participate in. And if that’s commercial voiceover, then yes, you must listen to commercials. Lots of them. Don’t watch them. Listen to them. Close your eyes, and listen to the voiceover, as well as the music and sound effects. Do this for five minutes each day on ispot.tv. Or, if you have an audition, prepare for it by watching that advertiser’s campaigns. What kind of voice did they hire most recently? Do the specs on your copy match the characteristics of the voice they used last, or are they trying to go in a different direction? Make it your business to participate in your business. If you’re interested in narrating audiobooks, start listening to narrators who possess similar vocal characteristics to your own. “She sounds sorta like me” is a eureka moment in the world of audiobook narration. Study her phrasing, her baseline intonation, her characterizations when reading dialogue. Pull up the voice recorder app on your phone, and repeat a paragraph that your vocal doppleganger has just read. (Audiobook narrators speak in paragraphs, not sentences. Try one on for size!) Now, play it back. Compare your read to her read. Now do it again, and see if you can somehow make your read better. This little exercise will help you groove your style, your pace, your breathing, your delivery. And it has nothing to do with your voice, but everything to do with your ear. Here’s another tip that a voiceover coach gave me when I was first starting out: If you’re going to inflect your voice, do it in half steps instead of whole steps. Think in terms of a piano keyboard — if you’re going to inflect upward with your voice, go from a C to C#, rather than a C to a D. Take for instance, the line “How are you today?” The writer of the brilliant line has made it clear in the specs that he needs a happy, energetic voice for this particular piece of copy. To most actors, that means there’s a good chance you’ll inflect your voice up and down in a more dynamic way than you would normally. Don’t do it! The writer’s direction is sometimes useful, but more often than not it’s a trap! (And we all fall for it.) Try saying “How are you today?” as if you’re talking to your significant other at six in the morning before you’ve had coffee. Keep it flat. Keep it decaffeinated. Say it a couple of times. Record it. Listen back. Then, return to your microphone and try again, this time putting just a smidge of inflection back in. But do it half-heartedly. Or rather, in “half steps.” Now, do it again, and forget the entire exercise. Just “throw the line away” as voice directors like to say. All of this work is to train your ear. Not your voice. Of course, there are non-believers amongst us. Many casting directors in L.A. will often NOT have headphones in their recording booths. They’ll tell you, “Actors listen to themselves too much. I want a natural read, so no headphones.” But let me tell you, it’s jarring for many actors who are used to working with headphones to suddenly not have them. And while there may be some truth to headphones creating problems for the newcomer, every seasoned pro I know disagrees with these casting directors, but we adapt and make do. (That is our job ultimately.) It’s the casting director who misses out, because the seasoned pro has developed an ear, and they use that ear to produce narration that breathes life into a script and onto a screen in a way that people without a trained ear cannot. Singers use in-ear monitors when they sing. Why? Because their ear and their voice have become one and the same. If it truly bothers you to hear your own voice amplified while you’re reading, then ditch the cans! You can still develop a sharp ear without them. Just know that you may have to wear them one day at a job when you’re being directed by someone in another city. They’ll be on the phone, but somehow, magically, they’ll be speaking to you through your headphones. Many VO actors employ the one-on-one-off method for wearing headphones, where you slide one of the cans off your ear toward the back of your head. It’s a compromise that, hopefully, more casting directors will be open to in 2019. After all, this is earover we’re talking about. -- -- 25 year voiceover actor, narrator, teacher, and demo producer based in Los Angeles. www.edcunningham.net Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*_YN4Vz4TQONYOcLOr9zb6A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*TAG-2o-tA6EsX2teiFEqSA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*_YN4Vz4TQONYOcLOr9zb6A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*tWNwRooTJW2AwxpTiT87Kg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_YN4Vz4TQONYOcLOr9zb6A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*1N3m7_ztZ3AGYZCx6Fucfw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_YN4Vz4TQONYOcLOr9zb6A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*fyqql89lCCu7wILRDHE9fQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_YN4Vz4TQONYOcLOr9zb6A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*nChshyHhYer985FIUWu6TA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*maC8NLpto3tNwluhoRODsw.png']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@edcunningham_3740?source=post_page-----60c2ba2cf09c--------------------------------,126,5 min read

How To Get Ready For The Age of Digital Companionship.,"Written by Samuel Carlton,Getting Closer to the Slippery Slope.,The Desire for the ‘Perfect Mate.’,The Desire for the ‘Perfect Mold.’,How Will You Face the Future?"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Samuel Carlton Follow DataDrivenInvestor -- Listen Share “Falling in love is a crazy thing to do. It’s kind of like a form of socially acceptable insanity.” — Her (2013). — In the 21st Century dating scene, many singles are longing for ‘a deeper connection’ in addition to finding chemistry with ‘the right one.’ With the advent of apps such as Tinder or Bumble, it can seem even easier — or harder, depending on who you talk to — to find that special someone worth sharing your life with. What used to be a process relegated for matchmakers, mixers, and clubs everywhere is now harnessed in the internet’s potential. No longer do you have to leave your home to find somebody special — you can scroll through an online marketplace of people on your phone, tablet or computer. One of my previous articles dictated how this has changed the dating game… ( …But it remained mum on the inevitable consequences artificial-intelligence will cause to human-relationships everywhere). A quick scroll through search engines reveals where we’re at already. In places like Japan — which is already experiencing historically low marriage and birthrates due to several socioeconomic factors, middle-aged-men can be rented to act not only as private confidants but to perform tasks involving advice or listen to troubles ailing clients. Services like these can deter the stress friends and family members bring into life’s fray — especially if questions involving romance pop up. There are already services in the United States where artificial-intelligence can take care of older demographics but when it comes to romance and companionship, many modern video games can allow the player character to couple with eligible bachelors or bachelorettes over the course of the game (the space-opera Mass Effect, the farming-simulation Harvest Moon, or even the high-fantasy Elder Scrolls series are notorious for having these features). Even if romance isn’t the main objective of the game, it’s at least offered to make the virtual world seem more…human…than it normally would be. But…what if romance is an interactive medium’s main objective? “Oh, I see. You don’t like real girls.” — Blade Runner 2049 (2017). — Nobody’s perfect. While people tend to search for a mate that’s going to be compatible in personality, goals, and desired looks, websites and apps are already helping people scale down to a niche that defines exactly what their preference is. Even in spite of this, online-dating is never a sure thing. If there is a demographic surplus of eligible people, some may be left out in the cold. To illustrate this, an entire industry has arisen in places such as China to help the overflow of single men connect with a relationship. If suitable mates are in short supply, something has to give. Popular culture has been touching on the idea of a virtual mate ever since complex programming became a mainstream idea. Relatively early works such as Philip K. Dick’s Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep (1968) and Isaac Asimov’s Forward the Foundation (1993) all contain the exploration of romance between human and non-human. Today, films such as Her (2013), Ex Machina (2015), Blade Runner: 2049 (2017) — the film being a sequel to the first adaptation of the aforementioned Electric Sheep, and TV shows like Black Mirror (with episodes such as ‘Be Right Back’ (2013) and ‘Hang the DJ’ (2017) or Westworld (2016 — ) all playing or toying with the idea of what a romance between a human and a machine would look like… …assuming it’s even possible. The biggest appeal for a virtual companion is the ability for the user to design one that fits their schedule, needs, and personality. Instead of having to work out date nights or go through a bad relationship, many are leaving software-engineers to do the dirty work for them. This is leading to games and apps moving past the standard ‘dating-sim’ style of game and into ones where the goal is to reach a virtual ongoing relationship. Why bother searching for the real thing when a virtual one is already programmed for you? Although some may see games like these as harmless fun, it may not help for those who already struggle with unrealistic expectations for their love life. While professing your love for an artificial-intelligence may be something that only those dismissed as ‘loners,’ ‘freaks,’ or ‘weirdo’s’ may have to contend with. It’s also surprising considering just how many people have already used such games or services without a second thought. One industry that isn’t backing down is the sex industry. If relationships between man-and-machine may be murky waters not many want to tread, many are already jumping right into the pool of how robots could change the need for old-fashioned ‘relations…’ “When you are thirteen, you spend all your time imagining what it would be like to live in a world where you could pay a robot for sex. And that sex would cost a dollar. And the only obstacle to getting that sex would be making sure you had four quarters…” — Charles Yu, How to Live Safely Inside a Science-Fictional Universe. — Companies and developers engaged in the art of programming sex-bots are continuing on an upward trajectory to make them not only programmable but more realistic. The world of sex-robots has emerged from private novelties into an industry that might invade not only brothels but even Amsterdam’s Red Light District. With sex tourism changing, the use of virtual companions instead of real ones could do anything from preventing the spread of STD’s to cutting down on human trafficking. What sounds like a hard pitch is instead developing into the preferred road for those involved in managing such trades. If this eventually develops into a norm, then the question of whether this is a form of cheating arises. The more that robots are programmed to look, think, and feel like humans, then the more one needs to talk with their real-life-relationships about how they think and feel about this notion. Let alone any talk of how-far-is-too-far in terms of AI programming, a question some couples may have to face is how they’d react to being caught with a bot. If the robots aren’t even used as a real-life substitute but just something ‘for fun’ or ‘novelty,’ should it be considered a new social norm? “…then you grow up and it turns out you do live in that kind of world. A world with coin-operated sexbots. And it’s not really as great as you thought it would be.” — Charles Yu, How to Live Safely Inside a Science-Fiction Universe. — Regardless of how prevalence digital companionship becomes in the decades to come, there are two big questions we must ask ourselves. 1. Are we willing to tolerate the notion that others may find satisfying relationships with digital companions? 2. Are we willing to accept the fact that we might do the same? It may be evident that certain personality types are drawn to digital companionship over real ones. Regardless of how real the romance is engineered, for those not already sent down the rabbit hole of obtaining the ‘perfect mate,’ there will be little doubt you may come across a friend or family member who ends up choosing this direction or dabbling in what it offers. Who knows… …you may end up being one of them. -- -- DataDrivenInvestor Writer. Blogger. Sales Professional. Film Buff. Coffee Addict.

State Of Autonomy: December Recap,"Written by Mitch Turck,This Month’s Highlights:,Commercializations:,Coming In January:"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Mitch Turck Follow -- 1 Share Every month, I recap the news articles I’ve consumed around autonomous vehicles, calling out the highlights and keeping track of market progress. This is also your chance to nominate a topic for discussion next month. December was a remarkably light news month, but our wonderful media outlets came to the rescue by Frankensteining together a batch of “2018 recap” articles, most of which exclaimed that autonomous tech had faltered during the past year by highlighting the death of Elaine Herzberg and then tossing in some garbage material as filler. The sentiment is pretty far from the truth, but we know the public prefers stories over facts and logic, so that’s what you get from publications that get paid to grab you by the eyeballs. As a counterpoint, I’ll offer a brief recap of my year’s more notable editorials. May you go into 2019 a wiser person, or at least riddled with self-doubt: May Mobility continues to launch public shuttles around the Rust Belt, this time in Columbus, OH. Along with this hyperlocal, safety driver-supported route, they’ve also announced that Providence, RI will deploy in Spring ’19, marking their fourth city for public trials. -- -- 1 Future of work, future of mobility, future of ice cream.

Technological Determinism in Superintelligence,"Surviving Superintelligence: Part 3 of 4,Written by LeeAnn Felder-Heim"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in LeeAnn Felder-Heim Follow O’Humanity -- Listen Share Remember, Bostrom has taught us that, in creating SI, we can “fail” [cause irreversible existential catastrophe] in many ways; we face uncertainty at every turn; and we are leaving hugely important decisions about humanity’s future up to a robot, or up to humans who may not share our values. Bostrom asserts that these are inevitable facts; in this piece, I’m going to counter his determinism first with theory and then with real-world examples. Here it goes. Bostrom argues that it would be impossible to halt SI development because its incredible power will make it irresistible. Bostrom takes a deterministic standpoint in terms of technological development, in a similar way to Jacques Ellul, a French philosopher and sociologist. In The Technological Society, Ellul describes the deterministic adoption of new technologies by saying that individuals and states — in order to avoid being crushed or outcompeted by technological advance — must align themselves with it: “The individual is in a dilemma; either he decides to safeguard his freedom of choice, chooses to use traditional, personal, moral or empirical means, thereby entering into competition with a power against which there is no efficacious defense and before which he must suffer defeat; or he decides to accept technical necessity, in which case he will himself be the victor, but only by submitting irreparably to technical slavery. In effect he has no freedom of choice.” This mechanism removes freedom of choice from individuals as well as from politicians and entire states. In this way, all individuals and institutions are roped into furthering technological advance and efficiency. For example, while self-driving cars will put millions out of work, the fact that some country would inevitably develop them (and if another country does it before the US, we will lose even more jobs and market share) propelled President Obama to propose spending $4 billion on research into self-driving cars. On an individual level, I spent years arguing the merits of the flip-phone and railing against the smartphone, and then I (like a classic technical slave) jumped on the smartphone train in order to compete for a promotion at work. We can see the mechanism Ellul describes all around us. But does that mean that it is inescapable? For Ellul, it is — he is a libertarian purist and believes that any type of collective action is a part of “technical slavery” and is unacceptable because it reduces his “freedom.” But in the face of a technology (SI) that would literally remove all decision-making power from all of humanity (and potentially end in existential catastrophe), we must set purism aside. We must accept the reduction of certain types of freedoms to avoid the ultimate reduction in human freedom! Now that we’ve decided it is okay to use collective organizing to control deployment of dangerous technologies, we can point to a few positive examples of this in human history: biological and nuclear weapons. The use of biological weapons was first regulated by the Geneva Protocol, which was later supplemented by the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) — to which 178 states have signed on (as of December 2016). The US enacted the Bioweapons Anti-Terrorism Act in 1989, which applies the convention to private citizens and criminalizes violations of the convention. One major flaw with the BWC is that it lacks any formal method for monitoring compliance; it instead asks for voluntary annual reports. Negotiations towards an internationally binding monitoring system took place between 1995 and 2001, ending when the Bush administration decided that the US could not be bothered by such silly things as international agreements to prevent mass human suffering… Nuclear weapon development, on the other hand, does have a robust monitoring system (put in place under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-ban Treaty). An international organization headquartered in Vienna uses various technologies (forensic seismology, hydroacoustics, infrasound and radionuclide monitoring) to monitor for any sign of a nuclear explosion. They deploy on-site inspection for countries where concerns about compliance arise. This organization has 337 monitoring facilities located all over the globe, and all monitoring data is sent to all states that have signed on to the treaty. In addition to this monitoring system, Mutually Assured Destruction AKA “Balance of Terror” (both great band names), continue to prevent nuclear attacks because, when country A launches a nuclear attack against country B, country B is able to launch a counterattack against country A before country A’s nuclear bomb launchers are annihilated. Both countries have early warning satellites and radar systems, allowing them to detect an attack within minutes and launch strategically located ICBMs (Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles) against the aggressor country. Knowing this, both countries are very unlikely to launch an attack. So, we were close to having a binding monitoring system for biological weapons, and we have a robust monitoring system for nuclear weapons. Additionally, Mutually Assured Destruction further impedes the deployment of nuclear technologies. While we certainly have not removed all threat of nuclear or biological weapons, we also haven’t blown ourselves up yet. So, using these positive examples, we can theoretically apply similar methods for impeding SI deployment. In part 4, I will discuss two (big) remaining questions: What would be required to impede the deployment of SI? And, How can we make sure that happens? -- -- O’Humanity Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*PO2dJP9MV8LZ87Du9gddrw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*YfSUuvtC7C5mh8Fob3jOHA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/0*RmJ7dt2ythri9qFT.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*PO2dJP9MV8LZ87Du9gddrw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*YfSUuvtC7C5mh8Fob3jOHA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*1nI0HtlFFeQejOpx.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*PO2dJP9MV8LZ87Du9gddrw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*q1ycDfxHVsRPFz0xbqVq2A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*J38cL8jf5pFiZ-09.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*0kgIqu-EjAEwrr9rfrK0ng.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*dVKeHPMm8APlpiyc2mNF8A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*a1CSCQTspnakRrRj.', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*PO2dJP9MV8LZ87Du9gddrw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*TQlEMeYwwWc38Wqm7EfCTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*0-N4JrXpZG1KJfIrAutd3A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*vzu3JPzaq2EZKTZNY9BhLA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*lEmL62oZdrOOWIzAAFKiFg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*i2zLIwC9mftamP1dbciCeQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.comhttps://medium.com/@Crux_of_Orion?source=post_page-----4b0e1b9cf9dc--------------------------------,6,4 min read

RPA and the Future of Work,Written by Rob King," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Rob King Follow DataDrivenInvestor -- 1 Listen Share There is seemingly a contradiction around the impact RPA is having on people and jobs. On one hand, you have the claims that by solution providers that jobs are not being lost, while other industry commentators claim that the benefits cannot be achieved without loss of jobs. What is the truth of the situation? Can they both be correct? Is it possible both scenarios are actually correct and not entirely contradictory? Let’s start with the optimistic view that automation simply eliminates the mundane tasks and provides the opportunity for more creative, complex and challenging new opportunities. This is explicitly describing that the nature of work will be changing. This is nothing new, in my experience, the advances in technology have been changing my job throughout my entire career. Furthermore, both in the USA and UK the current levels of unemployment are at the lowest we’ve seen for decades. Japan faces an even more challenging situation where the population is in decline and therefore even filling existing roles as workers retire is an impossible task. At this early stage of development, the evidence points to RPA not having a significant impact on job losses. That’s not to say there are no winners and losers in this equation, as some industries clearly find themselves in a situation where their survival depends on cutting costs; staff and buildings being the top two savings opportunities. Let’s look at the pessimistic view that millions of jobs will be lost through automation. These predictions often qualify their statements with two important caveats: the first being that they are existing jobs; the second is the long timeframe for these predictions. Accepting these two caveats, these statements — as far as any predictions of the future can be — are likely also true. the think tank Centre for London warned that almost one-third of jobs in London have high potential to be carried out by machines within the next 20 years What happens in the middle years is interesting. Since most predictions talk in 15-year timeframes, let’s look back at how work has changed since 2004: Facebook has just rolled out to a few college students. By 2017 it’s income had reached $40 Billion. Not to mention that social media generally now has 3 billion active users. iPod was THE gadget to own. It was the start of a whole new way of consuming music, that has advanced to streaming. Music streaming now accounts for 75% of music industry revenue and is worth nearly $4 Billion. Mobile phone innovation was the flip handset. iPhone and Android and the smartphone revolution were still a few years away. Today the smartphone market is considered to be worth $355 Billion! Add to that the spending on the Google and Apple App Stores is thought to be in the region of $40 Billion. Netflix had reached 1 million subscribers but was still a few years away from launching its streaming service. Today it has 137 million subscribers and an income of $11 Billion. The purpose of these examples is simply to demonstrate how much can happen in 15 years and while old jobs will certainly decline, new jobs will be created. Both pessimistic and optimistic statements about the impact of RPA are true, and in the middle new jobs we can only guess about will appear. My personal view is optimistic that the net impact of automation will not result in a loss of jobs but we will see the breadth of jobs change as radically as we have experienced in the last 15 years. -- -- 1 DataDrivenInvestor Author, Change Leader, co-Founder of Wzard Innovation, Lean Six Sigma & RPA Consultant, Public Speaker, Facilitator, Moderator, Home Brew novice & big movie fan Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/0*b0Hx1e4HjILq7p44', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*o77uCfTREbt6qDVoACFigw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*UAHKYM5IUX4hl8mtIlH5oQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*-sZ6rLICaQtZE-WrVpEDXw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*o77uCfTREbt6qDVoACFigw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*pnATqahNMYD8IKf5uQDu8w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*o77uCfTREbt6qDVoACFigw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*vcNoq0SDXBl7nqnzNaSr7A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*xiFRgHfgfMR7S111UB2hMw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*RQ6IU5ZQqoSQocDbSyjC0A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*6mgEZmtgEIYKM-aqXYAgMA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*HC0tH1WFalVfq7ujh-tzEw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*o77uCfTREbt6qDVoACFigw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*TQlEMeYwwWc38Wqm7EfCTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*0-N4JrXpZG1KJfIrAutd3A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/0*3OsUtsnlTx9Svm4c.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*IPZF1hcDWwpPqOz2vL7NxQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*0fHUKyg3xtpNWpop35PR4g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*nChshyHhYer985FIUWu6TA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*maC8NLpto3tNwluhoRODsw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.comhttps://medium.com/@WizardRob?source=post_page-----77ffb21df08f--------------------------------,12,3 min read
Understanding Your Customer’s Experience: Are You in Orbit or Just Flying By?,"Written by James Marland,The Fly-by Approach,The Close Orbit,The Experience Economy"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in James Marland Follow SAP Innovation Spotlight -- Listen Share The experience economy dictates that we get to know our customers intimately, not just execute a “fly-by”. We’ve all been transfixed by the amazing precision of the New Horizons spacecraft in locating an object the size of Manhattan 4 Billion miles away. Even more staggering is the fact that it is a one-shot deal, a fly-by which can never be repeated. But this week saw another spacecraft in final maneuvers: Osiris-Rex went into orbit around an asteroid where it will spend a leisurely two years in orbit. The spacecraft will take high-resolution images of every square inch of the asteroid. During the summer of 2020, the spacecraft will briefly touch the surface to retrieve a sample and is scheduled to deliver the sample to Earth in September 2023. This got me thinking about the way that companies engage with their customers in the Experience Economy. Are you executing a fly-by, or really getting into a close orbit with your customers? Most companies engage with their customers just once, at the point of sale. Perhaps through a simple survey which in a follow-up email, which most customers ignore — I know I do. A more sophisticated approach may be through a loyalty card program, but that tends to focus on just the transnational nature of the interaction. What did the customer buy, how much did they pay. Neither of these approaches allow the deeper questions to be asked, such as — “Why did the customer buy?” — “How did we do in meeting their expectations?” — “How could we improve?” These questions remain unasked and unanswered. It’s as though a New Horizons scientist, after seeing an image of the surface of the rock, asks “can we zoom is a bit closer”? No, you can’t: the spacecraft is already millions of miles away. In the same way, a Customer Service Manager can’t ask a follow-up question such as “Did Mrs Jones bring her husband to the store that day?” Mrs Jones has left the building and is now miles away. The mission planners on Osiris Rex had the luxury of a much closer object, shorter radio lag and more fuel, so they could design their mission very differently. Different orbital trajectories can be programmed as the scientists learn more about the asteroid, every angle will be photographed, conflicting data can be corrected. This is the type of close relationship that companies need with their ever more demanding and fickle consumers, yet at the same time balancing that with their concerns about privacy and their desire that brands that they engage with should “not be creepy”. Osiris Rex had a very different mission profile than New Horizons, which had a trajectory built for speed and distance. It didn’t have the fuel to stop and get into orbit with Pluto, Charon and other bodies as it zoomed past. NASA had to make a trade-off between the two approaches. In the Experience Economy, it’s not just about what you know, but your ability to act on that insight with confidence and speed. Think about ways that companies try to understand their customers, suppliers or employees. Most tools show broad feedback but lack precision and speed. The timely process of surveys and manual feedback collection can take months to collect and analyze data. By the time decisions are made and products fixed, it is too late. It can feel like a scientist staring wistfully at New Horizons receding into the distance wishing “if only I had asked that question a bit differently”. At SAP we believe the next evolution of enterprise applications has begun with a real-time connection between the system of action and the system of record. You need both the trajectory to visit all of your customers, yet at the same time the ability to develop deep relations with them so you can deliver the experience they want. No longer do companies have to make a choice between the fly-by and the close orbit.

Teaming Up With Mount Sinai Co-Lab And Ogilvy Consulting For Open Innovation In Healthcare Pop-Up,Written by Harry Alford," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Harry Alford Follow humble words -- Listen Share The gaps in health disproportionately affect diverse and inclusive audiences. One way to eliminate these disparities and surface better solutions is through early adoption of health technology outside of the hospital to some of the poorest Americans. This is one of the many reasons we will be hosting a half-day open innovation event in San Francisco this week. The Open Innovation in Healthcare Pop-Up will feature a curated list of attendees ranging from startups to enterprises and investors. Solving tomorrow’s healthcare challenges requires today’s preeminent organizations to interface with healthcare systems in ways that they haven’t needed to in the past. The event will be hosted in partnership with Ogilvy Consulting and Mount Sinai Co-Lab as they both have the desire to transform, innovate and find solutions to healthcare challenges that have the potential to impact health globally. Together, we have convened practitioners from across the healthcare ecosystem to discuss how they overcome key challenges of making innovation work in their organizations. Some of these organizations include Dreamit, Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, Kaiser Permanente, Stanford and many more. The programming agenda will include a wide range of content, panels, and discussions from speakers such as: The event will also showcase up-to eight startups building solutions for common challenges in healthcare, meeting consumers where they are as well as additional opportunities to network over cocktails.

Top Challenges to Successful IoT Initiatives — And How to Overcome Them,"Written by Calum McClelland,You Need to Associate,Little Changes Are Big Changes in IoT Initiatives,What Challenges Are You Facing?"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Calum McClelland Follow IoT For All -- Listen Share In the past few years that I’ve spent in the IoT industry, helping to develop, deploy, and improve IoT solutions involving millions of sensors, I’ve learned that often the biggest hurdles to success aren’t technological. A Gartner study last year found that only 26 percent of surveyed companies were successful with their IoT initiatives. This is an abysmal statistic, but it doesn’t surprise me given the many I’ve personally seen — many of which are purely operational or organizational. Although many issues associated with #IoT deployments aren’t technological, they’re equally painful and difficult to overcome. || #IoTForAll @Leverege Click To Tweet Although many issues associated with IoT deployments aren’t technological, they’re equally painful and difficult to overcome. And if every organization has to overcome these challenges in a void, a 74 percent failure rate is likely to continue. But here at Leverege, we believe in openly sharing the knowledge and insights that we’ve gained through our extensive experience, because it’s this open sharing of knowledge that will help us all to move forward together, collectively amplifying our human potential. So in this series, I’ll be exploring the issues we’ve seen, with examples taken from our experiences, and how you can overcome similar challenges as you pursue your own IoT initiatives. Whether you’re a solutions provider building new solutions for clients, or you’re one of the organizations integrating IoT technologies into your current systems and processes, I hope this series of posts will equip you with knowledge and strategies that will help you to succeed. If you’re relatively new to IoT and the various technologies and terminologies associated with it, I encourage you first to read the Intro to IoT eBook I wrote. This is a comprehensive (but simple!) introduction to and explanation of many important concepts that I’ll assume readers know as I explore various challenges.  I’ll save the in-depth exploration for future posts, but here are just a few of the topics to come: We’re increasingly using sensors and devices to allow us to represent physical objects and their attributes digitally. For example, in asset tracking applications, you’ll likely have a tracker that’s attached to a given asset you’d like to track. The asset is the thing we want to track, but the tracker is the thing that’s capturing and sending data. Therefore, you need to know that this tracker is on this asset, which we call “association” or “pairing.” For most asset tracking applications, someone needs to manually associate a tracker to a given asset, and when you introduce a manual step, there are bound to be problems. From labeling issues during manufacturing to operational issues like employees simply not associating trackers to the assets, I’ll share some of the challenges we’ve faced with IoT Association and how you can avoid or overcome them. The Internet of Things is often called “a system of systems,” and with good reason: successful IoT initiatives usually involve a combination of hardware, software, and connectivity, which is then tied into business processes and operations. Because of the complexity and systemic codependence, a simple change in one part of the system — or subsystem — can effectively break the entire system of systems. Let’s say that you want to make some changes to the firmware on your sensor/device to help reduce the battery drain, so you reduce the number of messages sent from the sensor/device per day. Great! You’ve just added on a few months of battery life! But unbeknownst to you, your IoT system uses the number of messages from the sensors/devices to flag when a sensor/device may be defective. After making this change, you suddenly have countless sensors/devices being flagged by the system as defective, which at best hurts user confidence and at worst means that the system itself doesn’t work (e.g. if defective sensors/devices are automatically prevented from being used). Although this challenge effectively boils down to good communication, this can be difficult within a single organization — let alone across the multiple organizations and partnerships that IoT initiatives often require to be successful. In this future post, I’ll share some examples to demonstrate how seriously you should take even the little changes. I’ll also offer some strategies for effectively communicating and managing these changes. I have plenty more topics in mind that I’ll be covering after the above two posts, but this series is ultimately meant to be helpful to you, the reader! So if there’s a particular challenge that you’re facing or that you’d like me to explore, please let me know and I’ll make sure to prioritize it.

Invest Less to Innovate More,Written by Mark Mader," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Mark Mader Follow Smartsheet News -- Listen Share Generating ideas from insights that improve a business, or create value for its customers, might be the most important thing your business does. Such innovation makes an organization more competitive and more efficient, often translating to more success and bigger profits, or in other cases — survival. Investing in those ideas comes at a cost, of course, including the risk that failure could leave you in a worse position than had you done nothing at all. Fortunately, advances in technology aimed at empowering business users have fundamentally redefined what’s achievable and, at the same time, has improved the probability weighted outcomes of business improvement initiatives. As a result, the assumptions that business leaders have traditionally used to calculate the costs of innovation — whether “back-of-the-napkin” or comprehensive models — are no longer valid. In fact, I contend that the “risk” of innovation has never been lower. When business leaders have evaluated “innovation” opportunities for things such as process improvement, deeper customer engagement, or enhanced decisioning, they’ve generally considered six factors: But by reducing three key factors — cost, time, and resources required — business user driven work management technologies can also minimize the risk of outright failure. That means business leaders should recalibrate their assumptions about technology-based investment decisions, by increasing the probability of success. Higher probabilities combined with higher throughput of projects executed upon, can result in superior overall returns. Technology unleashes the power of innovation The driver is the ongoing infusion of technology tools, which has reduced real and perceived costs which were previously assumed to be too high to justify an initiative or process improvement. These tools include a range of work execution applications and services, and the automation and integration of work processes that wasn’t easily attainable just a few years ago. Those technologies make many ideas and innovations feasible without the costs traditionally associated with calling in scores of consultants or trying to climb up the consideration list of heavily taxed IT departments. This enables waves of new experimentation — more quickly and with less risk. Projects that used to take years or months to mobilize, can now take months or weeks, including change management and training — a big win from the absolute standpoint of time savings, but an even bigger win in a relative sense. In addition, powerful new “no-code” software allows business users — those closest to the opportunities for innovation — to deploy and configure systems themselves, with minimal dependence on technical resources. That allows companies to maximize their innovation “at bats” by investing in more ideas that come from employees at all levels and across all divisions of their organization. Empowering a broad range of knowledge workers to engage with their work in a richer, deeper, more meaningful way — and thereby transform their great ideas into innovative action — will feel like uncharted territory to leadership teams not accustomed to seeing business teams applying advanced technology. Embrace the benefits: unleashing the opportunity for innovation across an organization will lead to more base hits. I’ve watched as many business-driven innovations have, together, made a significant and positive impact on the business I lead and the people with whom I work. While all those base hits are great, technology is also helping drive more home runs than ever. Knowledge workers, empowered with tools to pursue more ideas at lower cost, can increasingly swing for the fences. And the innovative new companies they work for are increasingly rising up to challenge established businesses and even entire industries. Consider Uber, for example. Less than 10 years after its founding, it has disrupted taxi services in hundreds of cities worldwide. The company’s reported recent confidential filing for an initial public offering could give it a stunning valuation of as much as $120 billion. That’s more than the entire U.S. auto industry. Meanwhile, the price of a New York City taxi medallion has plunged from about $1 million in 2013, to about $200,000 today. And that actually demonstrates a new kind of risk — the risk of not facilitating innovation at all levels and missing out on new opportunities. The fact is that technology is lowering barriers for everyone. That means not just your current competition, but also companies that don’t even exist yet. And that’s what makes a company like Gillette vulnerable to Dollar Shave Club, and established cable providers vulnerable to Netflix. New technology isn’t always a zero-sum game, with winners driving losers out of business. Sometimes it creates entire new industries and opportunities, like digital home security systems, wearable tech like the Apple Watch, or digital assistants from Amazon, Google and others. Many of those opportunities haven’t even been identified yet. But we can say who will take advantage of them. It will be the more agile companies that empower their employees to innovate and iterate at a rapid pace. It will be the companies that continually adopt new technologies and experiment with them, with an eye toward creating value, not protecting it. Reconsidering the cost calculus and the evolving nature of risk are essential for businesses to find the best way forward in the era of disruptive technology. Every business leader, IT decision maker, and knowledge worker needs to recalibrate their assumptions about the costs and risks of business innovation. -- -- Smartsheet News CEO @Smartsheet.

Imagine a World Where…,"The Story of Your Startup,Written by Bryan Landers"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Bryan Landers Follow -- Listen Share One of the most crucial jobs of a founder is to tell stories. Origin story, mission story, product story, opportunity story... You tell stories to yourself, your friends and family, co-founders, teammates, customers, investors, and press. Here’s a simple thought experiment extracted from fiction writing to help you tell the story about a future changed by the existence of your product or service. A good science fiction story can be reduced down to a simple framing. “Imagine a world where…” The quality of the work a writer does to realize a world determines the quality of the story and experience of the audience. What’s the difference between that world and the one we live in now? What happens to the people who live in that other world? What are the greatest challenges they may face? What new possibilities become reality? Here are a few examples. The same concept works well when considering startup ideas. Counterintuitively with startups, the more unbelievable the story premise, the more potentially successful it will be if it works. Transformational, disruptive ideas will often seem terrible until reality proves that they’re not. Interestingly, you don’t always need to sell big cultural or economic transformation to the first users of your product. Uber needed only to convince people that they could push a button and get a ride to take them where they wanted to go. Airbnb needed only to convince people that they could rent a space where they needed to be. The best story to tell is the one that inspires the action you want people to take. You can use this thought experiment to inspire a creative mindset to frame your idea and the resulting consequences to write a compelling story to share when recruiting, fundraising, and selling. What story are you telling? Thanks to Sahil Lavingia for the conversation which inspired this story. He’s the founder of Gumroad, a profitable startup that makes it easy for creators to sell their work. He escaped Silicon Valley and lived to tell the tale, now as an artist and writer in Utah. Sahil recently published his first speculative fiction short story, Across the Border. -- -- Idea-stage investor/builder at Make Studios. Venture Partner at Backstage Capital.

Two Main Reasons Why Apple Products Are Super Expensive,"Written by Samuel Halimanto,The Software,The Brand"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Samuel Halimanto Follow -- Listen Share “No matter how much it cost. There will always be someone who buys it.” Pricey? Yes it is. Same specs higher price? Yes it is. But there are reasons for it. When you buy Apple product, let’s say iPhone, you don’t only buy iPhone. There are more to it. I make software in my daily life, and of course I get paid by my clients for it. But who pay for the iOS, macOS, and every software Apple makes? Unlike android phone manufacturers, who get their software freely from Google, Apple has to do it’s own R&D (Research and Development) and maintenance for its software. And yes it is very costly. According to appleinsider.com, in Q3 2018 Apple has spent $3.7 billion for R&D. So who pay for it? The answer is, Apple users do! Think about this, the price for every Apple products are including the software inside it. So if you buy an iPhone for lets say $800, maybe $200 in it is the software, and the phone without the software is only $600. That’s why you can’t find other phone using iOS, because they are selling the software too. Not only the software inside the phone. You buy the maintenance and updates for those software too. Lets take iPad 2 which came out in 2011 and got its last iOS update at 2016. If you bought iPad 2 by 2011, you got update for 5 years without having to pay anything more. It’s like a subscription for 5 years that you pay in front. Apple fanboys are EVERYWHERE. No matter what apple do, the fanboy will buy their products. But how? How could people fall in love with “Apple” as a brand without thinking about the specs or anything else? A simple scenario: Two friends coming to you, one uses iPhone, another uses Chinese phone. Your subconscious will think about them differently, won’t it? Why? Because Apple has merged into our lifestyle and it gives luxury to the users. People are willing to pay high to get that Apple logo printed on their devices, because it gives them the luxury. This is why every Apple products are expensive and will always be expensive. Selling something cheap will remove the luxury that Apple gives to the users. Those luxury that Apple gives is not cheap though. First, they have to limit their products to be only the high end products. It reduces their selling. And then the marketing is pricey too. Have you ever seen a bad looking Apple store? Nope, because it’s part of the marketing team to make Apple looks luxurious and exclusive. But, who pay for the selling margin and the marketing fee? Guess who? Despite being really expensive, people still buy it. There are many reasons for it. The hardware, the great design, or even specific needs for a job (like a programmer or designer). Apple products are unique, exclusive, and have its own feel and style. But is it worth the super price though? The answer varies. Here is my thought, in phone industry, as a Galaxy phone owner, I’m on Samsung’s side for now. It does more with lower price, the build quality is better, the hardware is better, and most of all, the display is far more superior than iPhone. For Mac, I think they have the best design and build quality compared to other laptops. But the price is really really high for those specs. The Mac OS is still a little bit behind Windows too in my opinion. But, if money is not a problem for me, I would go for it. In tablet industry, I don’t think iPad has any competitor though. The 2nd best tablet is not even close to the iPad as a king. I will not think twice to buy an iPad if I ever need a tablet. Well, I’m not an Apple fanboy myself, but I think despite being really expensive, Apple has reasons for it and people who buy it have their own reasons too. It’s a matter of preference. So, peace for every tech brand! -- -- Founder of Nibble, a great software and design house located in Bandung, Indonesia.

From summer fellow to full-time employee,"Rebecca Gray shares her perspective on the transition from fellow to full-time analyst at the City of Boston’s Department of Innovation and Technology.,Written by City of Boston,1. Find yourself at the intersection of data and public service.,2. Work toward tangible goals — with help.,3. Grow as a professional."," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in City of Boston Follow Innovation and Technology -- Listen Share Department of Innovation and Technology (DoIT) fellows have the chance to act as problem solvers on behalf of the City of Boston. After completing an Analytics fellowship last summer, I joined the citywide Analytics Team as a full-time data and performance analyst. My fellowship gave me an inside perspective on what it takes to move a large data project forward and develop strong working relationships in the context of local government. Thinking of applying? In case you’re on the fence, here are my thoughts on what a summer at DoIT can offer. As a DoIT fellow, you will be stationed at the heart of timely, impactful work (not to mention the heart of Boston). During my fellowship, I worked with the Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) to expand healthcare access in the City. Together, we built a web-based app to guide health insurance applicants through the enrollment process. At DoIT, you can grow as a data analyst without sacrificing your penchant for civic engagement. DoIT fellowships are structured with your development in mind. A personal mentor will help you scope and execute a long-term project based on your personal interests. My mentor brought valuable experience in both data science and project management to my fellowship. She was — unwaveringly — in my corner, whether that meant proofreading an email, troubleshooting over coffee, or simply sharing stories of her own experience as a public servant. This summer, skip the busy work. DoIT will equip you with the time and tools to develop robust, polished deliverables. Data is only as powerful as our ability to communicate its meaning. At DoIT, we work with data from departments across the City. Frequent, two-way communication is therefore critical to building trust and ensuring project success. One example? My teammates at BPHC loved the first iteration of my app, with one caveat: many Bostonians speak a primary language other than English. Seeking their feedback allowed me to include multilingual app features, and thus create a more accessible product. Spearheading your own project means ample practice in stakeholder communication and data translation — skills that will come in handy long after your fellowship draws to a close. Right now, you can apply to join our team as a Digital or Analytics fellow for summer 2019. Not sure if you qualify? Don’t count yourself out. In the past, DoIT has welcomed awesome fellows from many disciplines, including engineering, geography, public health, and urban planning. If you enjoy solving problems with data and are energized by public service, then you are who we’re looking for. And who knows — you could end up on the team for good! -- -- Innovation and Technology For non-emergency City services, dial 311, tweet @BOS311, or visit boston.gov/311.

Written by Danny Charvez,," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Danny Charvez Follow -- 7 Listen Share When is this Crypto bull run coming? The biggest question on the lips of every crypto investor is, “when is this crypto bull run coming?” In such a hugely manipulated market, retail investors have been absolutely decimated, seeing their investments shrinking from the word go and some people have never, not once, seen any upside to their crypto investments. This tale is very common and is very well known to the smart money, who know exactly how and when to apply pressure on the market to extract all the dumb money from emotional, inexperienced investors. Think of it as a see saw, when a market is going up, the smart money is in, when a market is going down, its because the smart money are liquidating its positions, but the point is, the smart money is always on the right side of the trade, so the aim is to be on the right side of the trade with them. A huge bull run in the crypto market is just around the corner, all of the foundations are being laid and the deals are being done with very little media attention as the elite allow the crypto mania to die down while getting ready to open their positions at their preferred prices. One thing is for certain, everything happening in the market is planned by the elite, there are groups of individuals who know exactly where the market is heading, and these are the guys who have had their money in one of the longest bull runs in stock market history, eventually a lot of this money will flood into crypto and kick off one of the biggest, quickest bull runs you’ve ever seen, likely followed by a huge correction even worse than what we are seeing now. In order to distinguish a directional bias in the short term, there is a noticeable inverse correlation with Bitcoin and the US Dollar. The Dollar Index is an average, based on a basket of major currencies and indicates the overall strength of the dollar. So when the Dollar Index is in a bear trend, Bitcoin is bullish and visa versa. From the 10th April 2017 the Dollar Index fell for a total of 287 days from 101.00 to 89.00 before consolidating then reversing. In the exact same period Bitcoin rose from $1200 to $20,000 before reversing at this level. From the 16th April 2018 the Dollar Index rose in 63 days from 89.00 to 95.00 before consolidating. In the same period, Bitcoin fell from $9900 to $5800. On a longer term perspective, the Dollar Index has hit the descending trendline for the third time and reversed quite violently from that region. Currently stalled below 95.00, this is a pivotal time for the Dollar Index as a break higher could result in a retest of 100.00 and the red dashed descending trendline where we could see another sharp reversal. The 100.00 resistance is aligned perfectly with the trendline. Technically we could break this trendline before continuing higher, but I personally believe the Dollar is in for a rough ride going into 2019. And could well be heading down towards 80.00. Currently, as of writing on 25th June 2018, the Dollar Index has spent the last 10 months below 95.00 and has not been able to break above this psychological level. Having found support on the 200EMA (black) price drove back up into the 95.00 region, and there is now a potential Fibonacci setup in play which could see price drive up into the 61.8–78.6 region, which is nicely aligned with the descending trendline and the 100.00 resistance, if we see a drive up into those levels we could see a sharp decline into -27 & -61.8 on the Fibonacci which is perfectly aligned with 80.00. However, we could also see this reversal take place sooner if price does not break above the 38.2 on the Fib, which is perfectly aligned with 95.00 where price is currently stalling. In summary, the smart money would only invest in a market while its climbing, rather than BTC when the price is falling. For BTC and the crypto market as a whole to really begin to flourish, we need to see weakness in the Dollar and in the stock market, which we are beginning to see the early signs of. The stock market hasn’t had a major correction since 2008 and it’s long overdue. Signs of the dollar becoming increasingly weak on a longer term technical perspective, are correlated with the fundamentals. A potential global trade war has already spooked investors and shown an impact on the markets already. In terms of BTC, until a clean break of $10,000 occurs we are still in a bear trend but this could change very quickly and weakness in other global markets will be the catalyst.

New in Symfony 4.3: Always Include Route Default Values,Written by Symfony," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Symfony Follow -- Listen Share Contributed by  Vladimir Luchaninov  in #29599. In Symfony applications, you can give route placeholders a default value so they can be omitted from the generated URL. Consider this route definition: If you don’t provide the value of the page variable when generating the URL for the blog_list route, the resulting URL will be /blog and the value of the page placeholder will be 1: Although this is the desired behavior in most applications, sometimes you may prefer to always include the value of the placeholder, even when you don’t provide it while generating the URL. In Symfony 4.3 we made this possible with a new syntax for route placeholders: The ! character before the placeholder name tells Symfony to always include its value in the generated URL, no matter if it's a default value: -- -- Official stories and announcements from the Symfony project.

Surviving the technical jungle,Written by Todd Kaplinger," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Todd Kaplinger Follow -- Listen Share How do senior tech leaders remain technical? Every winter break, I find myself looking to evaluate and/or go deeper in a technology that I want to better understand heading into the new year. This appears to be very common in the twitterverse based upon a non-scientific twitter search of “holiday write code”. With technology, there are constant disruptions that if you do not pay attention to, you will quickly fall behind the disruption curve. One of the largest disruptions we have seen in recent years is the explosion of containers especially Kubernetes. If you are not aware of containers in 2019, you are definitely behind many in the technology field. How does a senior technical leader get deep enough to know the benefits of such a technology and when to apply them is a constant theme in my career. I decided in 2018 to shift gears in terms of my focus and spend more effort writing code during the year and not wait for the holidays. I wanted to focus on leveraging the latest technologies with the goal of expanding my knowledge base and to remain relevant in today’s economy. While I always considered myself apprised of the latest tech trends and could articulate the benefits of technology choices and architectures pretty well, I felt that I could do more. Since I think there are many others in this space that are looking for ways to remain relevant and to understand what others in the tech industry are doing to stay current, I wrote my perspective on the past year as it relates to my career and technology. If you would like to learn more about my journey in 2018, I would encourage you to read my latest article https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/one-developers-career-inflection-point-todd-kaplinger/ -- -- Vice President SW Engineering — Chief Architect, Retail Solutions@NCR Voyix.

IOT in your Hotel Bathroom?,Written by Chris Herbert," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Chris Herbert Follow -- Listen Share The advent of AirBnB, VRBO, and others have give consumers more choices for where they stay on a vacation or business trip. This rapid rise of technology enabled new entrants have challenged hotels to compete. While some hotels have tightened their belts and focused on competing on price, others have seen this as an opportunity to differentiate themselves and focus on the guest experience. Many consumers believe that a better experience is worth the extra dollars. But how can you improve your current offering to guests? While there still opportunities on offering just premium versions of the basic essentials, there are plenty of opportunities to incorporate technology to enable a better guest experience and operational efficiency for the hotel operators. Alexa, The Hotel Concierge More Alexa devices are being added to hotels for the advantage of offering guests music selections and automated wake up alarms. The hotel industry is getting to a critical mass of Alexa integrations where software offerings are beginning to pop up. This skill offers a complete automated hotel concierge. Don’t know the wifi password? just ask Alexa. Need a resturaunt recommendation close by? just ask Alexa. Check out and close out the bill without the line? yes please. Smart Mirrors Intelligent mirrors are beginning to be marketed to the US consumer market and offering weather information and more. Some of these startups like MirrorCache is approaching the hospitality industry to offer room service options, temperature control, and a in room concierge. The convenience of accessing a concierge will continue to be a trend and multiple startups are beginning to enter this market. Robot Housekeeping? An interesting startup, Maidbot, is taking the idea of Roomba to the hospitality industry. This can be an interesting solution to offer a cleaner room while reducing one of the highest variable costs facing hotel operators. In the future, the technology will continue to improve to offer on demand cleaning and tracking of what rooms have been cleaned. Digital Toilets Visitors to hotels in Asia usually comment to friends on the cool toilet technology they found abroad. The innovations at Toto with a heated seat and bidet have been an excellent luxury experience to guests. New startups like where I’m working at, Shine, are expanding this experience with cost saving features for hotel operators such as self cleaning and remote leak detection. This is an opportunity for guests to experience a luxury not found in AirBnbs and for hotel operators to save money What innovations do you see impacting the hotel industry in the next 5 years? -- -- Squall Growth Marketing for Startups.

No Market Need"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Cortés Victor Follow DataDrivenInvestor -- Listen Share Contxto — 2019 represents a fresh start for most of us. We are motivated. We are thirsty for success, especially in our business life. However, as we already know, it is no easy task to start and grow a company from scratch, there are many ways in which we could screw up and fail. Yes, fail. And no matter what most motivational speakers and business gurus tell you about the goodness of failing, at the end of the day it still sucks! Today I present to you the 10 most common reasons why tech startups fail, so you are aware and you can do something about it before it’s too late. Vanity metrics do nothing for your actual website objectives, but make your marketing efforts look good. Jason Amunwa Sometimes founders find themselves tracking and measuring benchmarks that are not necessarily important to the company, meaning that they’re not directly related to its success (whatever their specific definition of success is). These are called Vanity Metrics, and even though they make you feel good about your business, they’re terrible for taking action. For example, tracking likes, number of followers and users instead of things like downloads, purchases, churn rate and retention rates, etc., are more about feeling good rather than planning effectively. Vanity metrics are self-sabotaging and they’re named that way because many founders feel good with the delusion of a thriving business based on these metrics, instead of facing the cold hard truth. Here’s a quick comparative list of vanity metrics versus the truly useful engament metrics. Focus is a matter of deciding what things you’re not going to do. John Carmack There was a little company called Burbn, a platform for checking in places, reviewing the spots and also uploading pictures every now and then. Long story short, their initial model did not go as planned and they decided to focus on one thing: uploading pictures. So, Burbn grew some more and now it is a more or less known app called Instagram. Moral of the story? Do not name your startup after a spirit. Just joking, the moral is that focusing on one single thing and being the best at that one thing, will most likely boost you rather than detract you. Heinz, the ketchup company, can also confirm. In YC’s case, the number one cause of early death for startups is cofounder blowups. Sam Altman Team is key, people. A great product with a poor team will most likely burn down. While a great team with a poor product might find the way around. They pivot, they test, and most importantly they keep trying. There are many things that could go wrong with a weak team. Mainly, giving up too easily, co-founder conflicts and poor leadership. When things get ugly (and they will), co-founders usually have conflicts. If you and your team are not able to withstand those issues and push through, it will, most likely, fail. When things get ugly, most people do not have the gut and courage to keep going and they give up too easily. Finally, as a founder and leader you have to show your collaborators and employees that things will get better. If you display weakness and lack of confidence, they won’t feel safe either. A team that doesn’t believe in their leader always result in chaos. The right thing at the wrong time is the wrong thing. Joshua Harris Bad timing is also a well-known startup murderer. Some real-life examples include Myspace and Friendster. Most people believe being too late in a market is the only timing issue a company can face. However, being mistimed means being either too early or too late for the market. Here are some over-early companies:1. Webvan: Today Conershop/Instacart2. Pets.com: Today Petflow.com3. Letsbuyit.com: Today Groupon4. Beenz.com: Today Cryptocurrencies5. Justin.tv: Today Periscope Great timing is hard to predict, and there need to be many variables in place in order to successfully launch a startup. The pre-existence of enabling technologies, optimal economic conditions, and trends and cultural acceptance are key factors for founders to take into consideration. In his Ted Talk, Bill Gross explains why bad timing is the single most important reason for startup failure. I might not think it’s the number one reason, but certainly one of the most important. If you build it…you may still need Google AdWords. Jennifer Mesenbrink Straight to the point. Poor marketing is as bad as a bad product, if not worse. I’ve seen bad products with great marketing develop traction, but rarely gets a good product with bad marketing even noticed. Also, spending huge amounts of money in marketing just for the sake of doing so, with no real specific strategy and measurable goals can kill the company itself. This is closely related to point 2 (below). Get rich or die tryin’. 50 Cent Okay, I didn’t find any ad-hoc quote, but I like 50. Many times, the product is good, the marketing is great and the team is amazing. But many times, the product itself isn’t able to find a proper way to monetize its services. This is the problem many freemium services and media companies face. People use their products, but they’re not willing to pay for them. Also, there are companies whose monetization strategy started way too late and failed to implement it later on. Napster is a clear example. Even though there were 80 million users using the music sharing platform at the top of their game. They failed to implement a SaaS business model later on, after copyrights lawsuits started flooding the company. The winners of a unit economics contest would be more likely to build successful companies. Brad Hargreaves Just like burn rates, this could be very much improved if only founders were a little bit self-aware. If your business does not make sense in unit terms, it will not be scalable in the long run. You need to know your margins, your cost structure, your LTV/CAC ratio and your revenue streams. If you do your calculations on a “per unit” basis, and it still doesn’t make sense, they do not seem realistic, or the outcome isn’t profitable, then no matter how many customers you reach and how many downloads you get, it will not be a business but a very costly hobby. Read more about Unit Economics here! All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition. Peter Thiel Peter Thiel has a very fatalistic perspective on competition. He believes than only companies that make it to “monopoly” status will be successful in the long run. I do not agree. Entirely. For me, competition is healthy, but it is also responsible for the death of millions of companies. Capitalism is a wild animal, and it doesn’t really care about anything other than supply and demand. Only the fittest will survive, and at the end of the day, consumers are the ones who decide that. Be clear about your vision and make sure to display that as an unhidden competitive advantage. Ask yourself honestly and consciously: Why would someone buy my product instead of the other options? Money is like gasoline during a road trip. You don’t want to run out of gas on your trip, but you’re not doing a tour of gas stations. Tim O’Reilly Yes, money is not the ultimate goal. It should not be. But that doesn’t mean you don’t need money. It is a means to an end, and it is not just helpful, but necessary. Most founders are very aware of this, but it is worth reassuring. Companies with suboptimal burn rates, and not enough sales to bootstrap their operations often find themselves sinking after their initial investment gets consumed. That is why it is crucial to always be aware of what your monthly expenditure is and to start planning the fundraising before running out of cash in the bank. Read more about how to improve burn rates here! The life of any startup can be divided into two parts — before product/market fit and after product/market fit. Marc Andreessen Painful. Painful stuff. What is worse than falling in love with a girl, buying her gifts and flowers, setting up dates and trying to make that person love you, just to find out she is not interested in you? Yeah, it sucks. But it is not nearly as bad as falling in love with an idea, developing the product, investing in marketing and ultimately finding out, people don’t care about it. Ouch! Many times, people let themselves go based on the sexiness of an idea, instead of actually realizing people have a need. Interestingly enough, sometimes the least sexy startups are the ones that have the biggest market opportunities. Perhaps because few people are willing to venture into that market? On the bright side, I can almost guarantee that no entrepreneur that has gone through this issue is going to make the same mistake again. Identify whether the market has a need and find a solution for it. Not the other way around. Failure is overrated. Do not aim for failure, rather try succeeding the first time and if you happen to fail, learn from it. Anyways, these 10 reasons will surely make you meditate on your new years' plans.

Cleaning Up The Chain Of Custody For Medical Implants With Blockchain,"With lives on the line, it’s necessary to have a chain of custody system that can help clean up supply chains.,A large part of the value of blockchain is that the data on these supply chains will persist.,Cleaning Up The Chain Of Custody For Medical Implants With Blockchain,Written by Sam Rad 🔮 · Samantha Radocchia,Having a blockchain-run chain of custody (COC) will ease patients’ and providers’ peace of mind because it provides proof of origin.,Digitizing chain of custody records and placing transactions on blockchain will eliminate many questions.,If you have an existing physical chain of custody, consider adding a blockchain backend."," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Sam Rad 🔮 · Samantha Radocchia Follow Good Audience -- Listen Share Counterfeit goods are a massive global industry, worth almost half a trillion dollars worldwide. These items worm their way into just about every industry you can think of, including some you may have considered safe from the threat of fake products. In the early days of co-founding a startup focusing on supply chain solutions, I spoke with people from a variety of different industries who were worried about counterfeits and diversion in their supply chains. But one industry that stuck out to me, in particular, was medical devices. It’s difficult to imagine someone is out there counterfeiting life-saving devices or implants, but it does happen. In fact, more than $51 million in counterfeit medicine and medical devices were seized in an Interpol operation back in September 2017. It’s extremely disconcerting to hear the devices many rely on to keep them healthy may not, in fact, have been manufactured under rigorous scrutiny, but rather in an attempt to make a quick buck. Fortunately, the industry is well aware of the issue, and new technologies are making it easier than ever for companies to thwart counterfeiters. After optimizing enterprise supply chains for several years, here’s how I’ve found blockchain can help: The implications of counterfeit medical devices are frightening. Patients who go in for hip replacements are expecting that hip to last 20 years or more. But they probably aren’t expecting to be fitted with artificial hips that are counterfeited and made of low-quality materials. If a fake implant is used, what was supposed to last them decades suddenly has a much shorter lifespan. And for devices like pacemakers, the stakes are even higher. Without one, some of the products we trust to keep us healthy may actually have the opposite effect. For example, Boston Scientific’s use of polypropylene for gynecologic mesh implants recently came under scrutiny after more than 100,000 women filed lawsuits over the products. The plastic, originating from brokers in China, was deemed unsafe by experts. Yet after the supply of plastic was cut off, the company found another source in China — one that came with little visibility into the various steps in the supply chain. It’s simply unacceptable for patients and providers to be worried that the medical devices they’re using may have an unexpected effect on overall health. Tracking a medical device is simply a way of ensuring two things: it’s coming from the correct place, and, if something goes wrong, there’s no question of where it originated. Blockchain is the best way of eliminating any unknowns or questions. Say you’re following the path an artificial hip takes as it travels from the manufacturer to the hospital, where it awaits a hip replacement patient. The hip is tagged with a unique cryptographic identifier that links it to an identity on the blockchain. Each time that hip trades hands, from the supplier onward, it’s possible to register the timestamp and geolocation on the blockchain — creating an immutable record about the implant’s chain of custody. If everyone in the supply chain is registering those transfers of custody, it becomes difficult for counterfeits to enter the supply chain. They would have no identifier, and even if they did, the record on blockchain would show they had not originated from the supplier or manufacturer. Working backward through the registered COC, it would be relatively easy to find out where the counterfeits had entered the supply chain. Right now, if a company that’s tracking chain of custody goes out of business, that data may not be there 10 years later when a class action lawsuit begins. With blockchain, you know that the information will always be there. It’s not possible for the guilty party to have the classic “shred everything” Enron moment when auditors come knocking. Still, the goal isn’t to persecute companies within the industry, it’s to make sure they have better records that don’t allow anything to slip through the cracks in the first place. Chain of custody isn’t a new concept, and there are already different methods that companies can use to track products. Some are digital, while others rely on physical documents. If your company is already using a COC solution, it’s still a good idea to add a blockchain backend to help with asset management. Over time, the goal is for the medical devices industry to come together in a consortium and set standards for what they expect the chain of custody to look like for medical devices and implants. And once those standards have been set, and the industry has formed a network around them, new collaborative possibilities can happen. Counterfeits may be a pervasive problem, but not one that patients and doctors should have to worry about. With a tighter supply chain, backed by blockchain COC solutions, that goal can be turned into a reality. www.forbes.com -- -- Good Audience Anthropologist · Futurist · Keynote Speaker · 4x Entrepreneur · Best Selling Author Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*s-nAuwK6JMPZZiDQ4hU_Zg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*P-j2ZSNy2WbIn1dSDjzViA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1500/1*VA6kxcg7x1gxly1QcbtN0A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*s-nAuwK6JMPZZiDQ4hU_Zg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*P-j2ZSNy2WbIn1dSDjzViA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*trswIYs4xYfJCIGWJ_u1_A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*s-nAuwK6JMPZZiDQ4hU_Zg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*Bz0qSCPmRb509DRYpYEEkQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Wi9ixaqISpjX7TZb7sgDgA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qF035IHPptdJ5IEPvSm-QQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*AMgS0Vn3-2B46naSoJ-u2w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*87sZ08BqgBBQ1Ibx4GTshA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*s-nAuwK6JMPZZiDQ4hU_Zg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*TQlEMeYwwWc38Wqm7EfCTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*0-N4JrXpZG1KJfIrAutd3A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*niQ0sAwUszuyNMyH.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*pZPMtIONqtJYi2xHYD_Ivg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.comhttps://medium.com/@SamRadOfficial?source=post_page-----322c96bdacb2--------------------------------,104,4 min read
Soarin’ High: How a Thrill-Seeking Entertainer Uses LiveMe to Document Her Adventures,"The Beginning: Before LiveMe,Building a Community on LiveMe,What’s Next?,Written by Team LiveMe"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Team LiveMe Follow LiveMe Blog -- Listen Share For broadcasters around the world, LiveMe is a place to share their life, as well as their talents and passions. For Kaity Tainer (Kaity in Orbit 🌎), it’s all of those things and more. While she works as a model and actress, she’s also a thrill seeker and documents her adventures for her LiveMe fans to experience with her. We talked to Katy about her early days working at a zipline course, finding a community on LiveMe, and what the future holds. Kaity is from University Place, Washington, and based on the variety of jobs she had growing up, it seems as if she’s always been ready and willing to try new things. “For a while, I was working at a zipline [and] ropes course and also at a float therapy center,” she told LiveMe. “I had always been interested in doing more different activities, diving into modeling, skydiving, and slacklining once I turned 18.” As she was preparing to graduate from high school, a fashion photographer who had recently moved from NYC took Kaity’s senior pictures as a favor to her mom. He immediately noticed that she was a natural in front of the camera. “He suggested I talk to other photographers in the Seattle area, as apparently, he thought I posed well and more similar to a fashion model than someone having their senior photos done,” she said. Later, after moving to Los Angeles to model professionally, Kaity discovered she enjoyed acting as well. “I started doing more acting gigs as they became available and I realized how fun that can be as well compared to still photography,” she said. “It’s so much fun to meet people on set, and I have found many friendships through doing commercials and random background work.” In 2017, Kaity appeared in the rock band The Plot in You’s music video for the song “FEEL NOTHING,” which has over 4 million views on YouTube. While pursuing her career in the entertainment industry, Kaity came across LiveMe and in 10 short months, she’s amassed about 109,000 followers. “I love the sense of community I’ve found by connecting and checking in with people most days,” says Katy about the community she has on the platform. “I’ve built a strong connection with many of the people that watch my show, as well as the broadcasters that I tune in to.” Kaity, who refers to her followers as “friends” rather than fans, feels humbled by the following she has on LiveMe. “I always hope they feel that my broadcast is somewhere they can come to feel safe, accepted, and appreciated,” she said. In addition to broadcasting on LiveMe, Kaity has a few trips and various modeling opportunities in the works, but as we spoke to her, she was preparing for next adventure: a trip to Taiwan to attend LiveMe’s second Global Gala. Kaity was unsure of what to expect but excited to meet Mary Cameron Rogers, another Los Angeles-based broadcaster. “I’m looking forward to seeing who all is here! I have no idea who is! I’m also stoked to be trekking out here with MC🌹!” We can’t wait to see where Kaity’s adventures lead her next! Want to read more interviews with LiveMe broadcasters?

Draup Django,"Stateful Deletion/Updation:,Draup Django:,Installation:,Utilities:,Limitation :,About Draup :,Written by Draup Platform"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Draup Platform Follow Draup Technology -- Listen Share At Draup, we take problem-solving to the next level by using cutting-edge technologies and having some of the brightest minds running highly complex algorithms on huge volumes of data. While we have the capabilities to solve most challenges, we also rely on open-sourcing which equips us with the right tools which allows us to find truly unique and innovate solutions to several problems. The team at Draup has been trying to solve the problem of stateful deletion/updation at the ORM level for Django. Whilst solving the problem, we also wanted to build a generic solution for ORM, so it could be used by Django-developers as well. Stateful deletion is when an object cannot be directly deleted, without a prior prompt message (when deleting a single object entity, the prompt message gesticulates all the other dependent objects tagged along with the parent entity, before deleting it). Stateful updation occurs while transferring object dependencies from one object entity to another object entity, through which duplicate entries from database-tables can be erased. Draup Django is primarily a Pip Package. It provides stateful deletion/updation and is, available here. pip install draup-django Get Affected Objects: Delete Object: Update Object: Usage: Note : Draup is an enterprise decision-making platform for global CXO leaders in sales and talent domains. Draup combines Artificial Intelligence with human curation to help organizations make data-driven strategic decisions.

The Dark Side of Assumption,Written by Levi Patton," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Levi Patton Follow -- Listen Share Assumptions are all around us. We make them all the time, often without thinking twice. As designers, we arm ourselves with all kinds of tools, techniques, and methodologies aimed at clearing the path of assumption so we can design for users, and not for ourselves. Still, assumptions are always out there, creeping in around the edges waiting for the right moment to slide in and cloud our judgment. Sometimes assumptions can be expensive. And there’s nothing like an assumption blowing up in your face to make you think twice about taking action without first having all the facts. Last month I made an assumption based on good-natured intentions that ended up costing $500, some strained relationships, and 100 pounds of spoiled meat. Allow me to explain. I live in the mountains where I rent a small carriage house above my landlord’s garage. I get to drink my morning coffee on a porch that sits at 7,500 feet and looks out at snow-capped peaks and miles of pine forest. Humblebrag aside, it is by far the most amazing place I have ever lived, and I’m super grateful that I get to call it home. Because of this, I have a lot of respect for the house, the property, and am in great standing with the landlord. So when he went out of town on a 10-day hunting trip this summer and left the light to one of the property’s outbuildings on, it only made sense to do the good-neighborly thing and shut the door — which was ajar — and turn off the light. I assumed that he had been working in the outbuilding during the day with the light on, and had forgotten to turn it off. I even had accumulated mental evidence (assumption ammunition) that this had to be the case. Not once in my 2+ years of living here had I ever seen that outbuilding with the light on. Also, with the door being partially open, something just didn’t seem right. It seemed so natural just to march over, turn off the light, close the door, and cash in on that ‘good deed glow.’ I didn’t even consider any alternatives as to what could be going on in that scenario. I thought I had just saved my landlord 10-days worth of wasted electricity and prevented some mountain animal from wandering into his storage room. I got a text from my landlord 10 days later: “I’m DESPERATELY trying to figure out when the light was turned off in the outbuilding.” An anxiety-boulder dropped in my stomach and started a panic-landslide through the rest of my body. I hadn’t even thought about the light in the garage since turning it off over a week earlier. My mind raced through the possibilities of what could be wrong. Was the light supposed to be on!? Why!? A cascade of panic-riddled assumptions ran through my head (assumption inception). I learned later that night that leaving the light on was indeed intentional. It just so happens that the power for the outbuilding is connected to that specific light switch, and that there was over 100 pounds of elk meat in a freezer tucked away in the corner of the room. In the 10 days since the power was shut off, the entire 100 pounds had gone rancid. The cost of butchering the meat alone was over $500, and it didn’t just belong to my landlord, but also to a group of friends from a previous trip who had expected to later receive their share. I was devastated. I honestly cannot remember a time where I felt so tremendously crushed with guilt. It was a Friday night after a long week, I had just made dinner, and was looking forward to enjoying the evening and the rest of the weekend. After the conversation with my landlord, I just sat there and stared at the cooling food feeling nauseous. A good-natured assumption I had made without a second guess had just caused some serious Friday night feel-bads. What went so wrong? The more I turned over the scenario in my mind, the more the idea of assumption became the core of this frustrating mess. Yes, I made some obvious assumptions regarding the decision to turn off the light: However, flipping the perspective and examining my landlord's side of the story comes with another list of assumptions: What made this particular situation so disastrous, was that assumptions were made on both sides. Each of us saw the situation through the lens of our own narrow perspectives and didn’t think to dig a little deeper and empathize with the other players involved in the experience. Communication on either end could have easily helped to avoid a wasteful and depressing situation. A text about the light being on, or a sticky note on the light saying, “don’t turn this switch off” would have easily prevented things from turning out so grim. A text on my end saying, “hey, I just turned off the lights to the outbuilding” would have kept a depressing guilt-tsunami from flooding my Friday night. There is also the awkward issue of accountability. Who was more at fault in this scenario? Ultimately, I was asked to pay for “some or all of the $500+ cost of butchering the meat.” That’s a heavy price to pay for flipping a switch under the assumption that I was doing something good. I tend to be a little more conscious of assumption-making these days. Even a small, seemingly benign assumption can have serious consequences. As a designer, I always try my best to eliminate assumptions when creating experiences for users; but also when anticipating the needs of clients, working with teams, and thinking through any creative problem-solving situation. Once you notice how assumption-riddled our day-to-day can be, it’s hard to unsee just how many auto-pilot decisions we make purely based on conjecture. To a certain extent, it’s unavoidable, and I think we have to be okay with that. As long as you take notice when you’re making an assumption, and ask yourself, “is there something I’m not seeing here… what could go wrong if I go through with this action without having all the facts?” Maybe this is just a recipe for overthinking-anxiety, which I already tend to be prone to. All I know is that from here on out, I’ll always think twice before turning off a light switch that isn't my own. -- -- Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*KN6DJcBQdJvxQSmi-R8tRg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1500/1*dEAaVbfjoi2PHNRwQfSTwQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*tsETdHc3T2z3I2k_ZlgEmA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*6-WErbqH0ag59z8kHCFMtw@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*KN6DJcBQdJvxQSmi-R8tRg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*fS3O2FVZO9h9t1E87ATaww.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*KN6DJcBQdJvxQSmi-R8tRg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*A1lBazmDaA5AHZZFHbWWVA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*KN6DJcBQdJvxQSmi-R8tRg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*8ocvfONDqb9f24NTCRivrA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*KN6DJcBQdJvxQSmi-R8tRg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*ZNahGS7EwPcevYHO_VutiA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*Diwc1DIGQArX7GSHdVtlXA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*OXfc8u07G_0gfOHaxpoctQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*H3DBMcaJgdDk4D16lggx5g.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Z1bzjaix4P6E2_od60fkuQ.png']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@levihpatton?source=post_page-----69978454b804--------------------------------,0,6 min read
Building Transportation Clusters: Various Entrances into the End-to-End Space,Written by Shorjoe Bhattacharya," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Shorjoe Bhattacharya Follow DataDrivenInvestor -- Listen Share The dream of directly connecting import movements with export movements has always been one for many. Shipping Lines, Forwarders, Terminal Operators, etc have salivated at the possibility of having such a predictable and efficient network, where import containers can go directly to the nearest exporter’s place without having to go to empty yards, where significant time is lost in finding the next trip. Now, with improving visibility and formal data collection finally taking place in the segment, this dream is getting closer to becoming a reality. Containers going from an importer’s chemical factory to an exporter’s FMCG plant while getting cleared by a relayed container surveyor is becoming a reality! The, march towards this future is beginning with players trying to conquer certain clusters where they have visibility and control. So, during this early adopter stage, the various stakeholders are all entering the realm in different methods vying for the same outcome: an expansion in the space where they can directly cater to the freight owners, by connecting imports and exports in a single direct chain. In a country where more than 85% of long-haul freight moves by road transportation, the natural 1st layer elongation into the extended logistics segment is road logistics. These days’ road logistics is shifting towards efficient road optimization, where the truck can be optimized, while meeting predicted schedules. Thus the various stakeholders’ are looking to build their own lane cluster’s on routes they are familiar with, where they have a strong network and operational control. Operational control and a logistics network are the keys to operating a successful end to end logistics program, where additional cargo can be handled without significantly increasing costs. These lane clusters will be won over by the stakeholder’s who start controlling both the inward and outward flow of goods from a seaport/dry port on key routes. By having operational control and visibility of the lane cluster the provider can increase the value provided to the customer by offering more lucrative rates through efficiency gains. Until another player gains control and visibility of the route to provide better efficiency, other’s will not be able to play at the same price point, thus the likelihood of a shipper staying with the single provider will start growing on pure value terms more than relational terms. Different stakeholders in the space have had their own methods of entering the space based on the prior core operational strengths. But, they all are looking to build their road transportation clusters: Some examples of prominent formerly niche players building their networks are the following: Shipping Lines-Lines are trying to provide door to door services on certain routes where they have presence and comfort. They are offering to take a box from Dubai to an importer on India’s West Coast, on a transport route they are familiar with. This door to door service is predictable. But rather than just ending the E2E process they are doing container triangulation by themselves so the container is re-positioned to the nearest exporter/empty park location immediately. On certain West Coast route’s lines have built their clusters in such a way they are able to immediately reposition the container directly from the importer’s factory to the exporter’s factory (without going to the empty park) thus saving a significant amount of time and fuel finding another customer that needs a container. A line attempting to move a container directly from an importer’s factory to an exporter’s factory requires tremendously visibility and control of a route, thus lines are only focusing on lanes where they have enough demand visibility of both import and export. Shipping Agencies-Some large shipping agencies are starting to enter the Indian transportation segment by taking vehicles on a dry lease, where they are continually finding cargo to ensure at profitable vehicle utilization. Unless there are direct volume commitments, the lease model tends to be the riskiest. So, a strong understanding of the movement of goods on certain clusters is required. The lease model only really works if the operator knows: The benefit of this model is its ability to provide strong control of transporters to the stakeholder, so the problem of availability of trucks reduces. If rapid expansion on clusters is desired, this model can be successful, as control of the truck allows the stakeholder to reposition in the truck to an exporter. Effectively this model can allow complete inward and outward movements control on key route clusters and may even allow for potential cargo diversions from other ports as 100% utilization routes can be controlled. Terminal Operators- Terminal Operators are looking to expand their footprint by building cargo community networks that are connected to individual route clusters These trade community networks collaborate with Port Community System’s, where the ecosystem can interact and share information. This process makes it easier to file manifests. This integrated system also helps customers located on key routes have access to services in a single window. For example, Pondicherry cluster is near Chennai Port Trust. From the portal, the Pondicherry customers can take quotations and can file clearances and on the cargo community network. Besides transportation, this additional service from the local terminal operator eases the work of local customers and can help increase choices when selecting services, as transporters, CHA’s and other service providers can be cross-compared on the trade network that is linked with the local PCS. Since container shipping began in 1947, providers have always talked about door to door service, where a shipper can book a container and it is delivered by the single stakeholder arranging and providing all services seamlessly. Service providers are getting closer and closer to that future as they are powerful companies in the logistics chain with a strong global presence. Building key transportation clusters have been the start to such a future. Only, now with growing transportation visibility and machine learning predictability has such a model become possible. Matching imports and exports on core routes have always been about having options in connecting pairs. These flexible options in connecting pairs are critical as predictable vehicle turnaround time is crucial in reducing uncertainty and in getting this model to work. With options in connecting pairs, it becomes possible to connect a trip to a large importers place to small exporter A, small exporter B, or small exporter C. The power of historical data also provides the “best exporter/importer pick” based on previous turnaround time and truck performance. This optimal pick model is what can make this successful. So, just like how uber or airbnb have very accurate algorithms in their spaces, the logistics players with the deepest visibility on their routes, will take it all and become the single service provider, where they directly connect import cargo owners to export cargo owners in a single move. -- -- DataDrivenInvestor Tech History Nerd |Unpacks Transformative Tech Trends| Global-View 6+ years in Tech & Logistics in US/India/China Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/0*IF-pQPW99uhXbLRM', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*9Hr7cu1nnPNkWbCdo5-ZYg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:900/1*twrqXMHZg6e2o9pC3in0Sg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*9Hr7cu1nnPNkWbCdo5-ZYg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*sR-Am-egh6PU5wJLEzG7ag.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*9Hr7cu1nnPNkWbCdo5-ZYg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*vcNoq0SDXBl7nqnzNaSr7A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*xiFRgHfgfMR7S111UB2hMw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*RQ6IU5ZQqoSQocDbSyjC0A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*6mgEZmtgEIYKM-aqXYAgMA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*619IEYGrVWGKPAH8zgYRHg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*9Hr7cu1nnPNkWbCdo5-ZYg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*9KwYxU9u863ypxeM0tL4iw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*qS2tNfSzD-IbCC4aAX2ZHg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*7CxK9riK2X7oJDEWKdW7CQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*TYNsHKGvELRsgalw4UwIdg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*JeaJWN5uIwe4UqSESIP4Nw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2fUTxt5Pesd2boHhhTuG7Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*k0ZqzbXCV2Iqak3oONL5tA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*TQlEMeYwwWc38Wqm7EfCTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*0-N4JrXpZG1KJfIrAutd3A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*iHDEaeT1-sStZ7QQLWAPgA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*0N8fBnW2J9GK15hUQ72Y5Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*cBIFfjjqzx8pzaemnAM0rQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*EhiV5eo34TIkvI6u-JFYmg.jpeg']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.comhttps://shorjoe.medium.com/?source=post_page-----1ac9cd16cbdb--------------------------------,11,5 min read

Performing Magic using your smart watch,Written by Carlos Justiniano," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Carlos Justiniano Follow -- Listen Share Like many youngsters, I grew up watching magicians on television. During my years in high-school I had one of the coolest jobs a teenager could have, I worked part-time at the local magic shop. The shop was more than just a shop. It was a workshop where magic tricks and larger stage illusions were created and sold to professionals. While I loved and still love magic, my journey lied in technology. Recently, I had the pleasure to combine my two loves. A quick search on YouTube revealed tricks using mobile phones, but I didn’t find any using a smart watch. I knew that the idea of using a less assuming device such as a watch could potentially create a more compelling effect. I decided to create a magic trick anyone could perform using their Samsung smart watch. Why the Samsung watch? Because it’s the one I own and one that allowed me to combine my other love for web-stack technologies. My first app idea involves the magician showing an audience member several ESP symbols and asking them to select one. The same symbol appears on the magician’s watch face. I built the app and a couple of weeks later, Magic: ESP Test was available in the Samsung Galaxy app store. I later had an idea for a card trick that allows the magician to ask a volunteer to chose a card and to then have the card appear in a smart watch. This is particularly effective because the participant believes they’re freely choosing a card and that card then appears in the watch. The effect can be repeated with a different card appearing each time. I went on to create a few other apps, some a bit less magical but still entertaining. For now, I’ve turned some of my hobby time attention back to traditional game development. I’m currently building a game engine designed for the Samsung Gear S2, S3, Sport and Galaxy smart watches.

Hackers Collaborate to Encourage People to Subscribe to PewDiePie (Again),"Written by Glen Whillier,If You’re Affected"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Glen Whillier Follow -- Listen Share The past year has seen YouTuber PewDiePie incorporated in a handful of creative hacks. Presumably this is because PewDiePie’s #1 spot has been threatened by Indian rival T-Series, so loyal fans have been resorting to potentially less legal means of attracting new subscribers. The most recent hack dubbed #CastHack exploits vulnerable Google Chromecasts, smart TVs and Google Homes by renaming devices “HACKED_SUB2PEWDS_#” and by displaying unauthorized video that both notifies the victim of their vulnerability as well as encouraging them to subscribe to PewDiePie. CastHack is the work of the hacker duo HackerGiraffe and j3ws3r. The same duo behind another recent hack that occurred back in November which forced tens of thousands of printers to print paper that encouraged people to subscribe to PewDiePie. The duo maintain though that their hacks are more about exposing vulnerabilities than about either promoting PewDiePie or harming anyone. “We’re only trying to protect you and inform you of this [vulnerability] before someone takes real advantage of it.” HackerGiraffe even condemned the actions of those who hacked the Wall Street Journal to promote PewDiePie. “The Wall Street [_Journal_] one was harmful and goes against what we stand for” For anyone affected by the hack the best way to fix it as confirmed by both Google and HackerGiraffe is “Disable UPnP on your router, and if you’re port forwarding ports 8008/8443/8009 then STOP forwarding them.” This is because this is a router exploit, it takes advantage of incorrectly set up routers.

The 3 Phases of a Technology Product Implementation — Phase 1: Engagement,"Establishing a Statement of Work (SOW),Written by productOps,The Engagement Phase"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in productOps Follow productOps -- Listen Share by Steve Yatson The purpose of this blog series is to walk through our product development process from the perspective of a manager on the product/design team. As we’ve refined and developed it over the years it has become known to us internally as the productOps Way. The example referenced is the set-up of a Sales Order Management System for Ithaka, an education technology company, but our approach is similar for all the projects we work on. Using this example, I hope to show the way various departments of our organization work with each other, and the client, to guide a successful outcome using a three phased methodology. In the first phase of any project the executive team will travel to a potential client and get travel points and five star meals. On their return, the product and design team will get notes, a debrief, and image like this: Do I sound bitter? In seriousness, this phase is an important and necessary step to understand the core needs and build a relationship with the client. The latter is usually achieved more readily after this first visit because most times neither the client nor ourselves have a firm grasp yet on what’s needed, the devilish details involved and the business or technical problem at hand. To get closer to the goal, the whiteboard sketches are cleaned up and simplified so the project managers and designers can begin to understand the scope of work and build a SOW for the discovery phase. We then move from the whiteboard to a popular diagramming and digital illustration application, OmniGraffle, for a clearer vision of the project details. Before launching into the discovery phase we want to make sure we’ve engaged with every stakeholder in the project and get as many of the requirements down up front as possible. Reflecting the project back to the client visually is a key strategy in making that happen.

CHURCH APPS — are they helpful? Or just a waste of time?,Written by Justin @ bltn," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Justin @ bltn Follow -- Listen Share Does your church have an app? They’re supposed to be “the thing” to do when it comes to connecting to your congregation, but I have to wonder — do they really work? Are your members actually using your app to engage during the service? Do they check it throughout the week for updates or announcements? Maybe it’s time to sit back and evaluate the ways we spend our hours as church communicators. If we are waisting our time doing something. Let’s stop doing that thing. Sound good? The church app is one of those things that seems like a given at this point. Apps are for everywhere and for everything. If you use an app at your church, when it was first introduced, it was a source of pride that you could tell your congregation to find you in the App Store. But those days are gone. Apps have been around for a decade and now it’s an embarrassment if you don’t have one. Right? Church Apps fill the same role as any piece of technology. They are designed to serve a purpose and solve a problem. Do church apps still serve a purpose and solve a problem? Over the last 10 years, for various reasons of travel and church planting, my family has been regular attenders at 5 churches and we’ve been repeat visitors to probably 10 more. Over that time, for those 15 churches, I have downloaded 1 church app. And I’ve used that app twice. (for work I’ve seen many other church apps and e-bulletins, and such, but that’s beside the point.) Maybe you use your church app all the time. Maybe your congregation loves it. And that’s awesome. The truth of it is though that every problem that the church app is designed to solve is better solved by something else. The media player in your church app allows your congregation to listen to and watch services. 78% of all video streaming online is watched via YouTube, the multi-billion dollar company. More of your congregation is watching video in YouTube than in your app. I don’t know your church or your congregation. But I’d wager anything that it is true. If last week’s sermon popped up in their subscription feed rather than in your app, how much more likely do you think it is that it will get seen? Your church app allows you to push messages to your congregation. Assuming your church app performs like any other app. For every 2 people that download the app, 1 of them will say NO to your notifications. But that’s the good news! For every 100 people to whom you send a notification, 3–6 of them will read it. Your mileage may vary of course, but the statistics on the technology of push notifications paint a very clear picture. Push notifications sent from your app do not work. Maybe you’ve trained your congregation to read them or to check in the app frequently for news, and that’s awesome. But if your announcement is where your congregation already is… facebook (~41 minutes each day), instagram (25–31 minutes each day), twitter (42% of twitter users use it every day). If you announcement is there, it is certainly more likely to be seen. You need a change of strategy. Instead of providing a place where people come to get stuff from you…. be someone who goes to where they are. The church app relies on your congregation to seek you out (and on a whole, they won’t). But a service like bltn puts your message where your congregation is. While spending less time than managing your church app, you can publish a mobile bulletin and deliver it to your congregations phones. You can set up a whole week’s worth of announcements on all your social media accounts. And you can put a paper bulletin in the hand of each member of your congregation Sunday morning. The numbers tell a story, and that story is… you should use bltn at your church. What are your thoughts? Does your church have use an app? What works well about it? What doesn’t? -- -- build a better bulletin… https://bltn.io Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*mVKhb3Ti9gWX97AF4lrv8A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:992/1*0qmTvcZtx9gfM-xI0vfTIQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*mVKhb3Ti9gWX97AF4lrv8A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*bhnjKd_LKqDrsNW81OWrAA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*mVKhb3Ti9gWX97AF4lrv8A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*Ym20E-gXBjnAgUVjq25d_Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*mVKhb3Ti9gWX97AF4lrv8A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*nChshyHhYer985FIUWu6TA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*maC8NLpto3tNwluhoRODsw.png']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@bltnapp?source=post_page-----4d289286120--------------------------------,0,3 min read

First Blockchain-Based Birth Certificate Issued in India"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Patrick Schvartzman — Block Gemini Follow Block Gemini -- Listen Share It is astonishing to see the progression that Blockchain continues to make. With devoted adherents developing, refining, learning and executing concepts to deployed applications, every day we come closer to interconnecting technology and services, one block at a time. As more power house giants and governments target new avenues, blockchain continues to flourish at an exponential rate similar to other technologies, as previously witnessed. Without a doubt 2019 will be a fascinating year for everyone involved in blockchain, and as a blockchain solutions company, we say that with confidence. Here is a recap of the latest blockchain buzz last December. The Tunisian Internet Agency (ATI) has formed a strategic partnership with the Russian based platform, Universa, a new generation of blockchain technology that emphasizes on tokenization and contractual agreements. Such initiatives entail a 10 year renewable strategic partnership, where ATI will be providing hosting services to Universa to facilitate further development. What objectives can be expected? ATI will develop value added services in the blockchain field, digital economy, and digitization of paperwork. Likewise, Universa will aim it’s efforts to develop additional applications and services to integrate them into new tech platforms, create e- certification and the digital economy. Together both parties will also build projects with BaaS (blockchain as a service), an initiative that includes digital currency, digital identity, as well as e-governance and smart cities. As blockchain captivates the interest of more government based entities, the push for solutions using blockchain based applications become fairly synonymous with identity management, digitization of documents, and overall governance to interconnect services and technology together. Click here to read the full article IBM Research and agtech startup Hello Tractor, a social enterprise that connects tractor owners and small holder farmers through a digital tractor sharing application, have developed an AI and blockchain based platform for Africa’s farmers. The pilot product is expected to deploy in 2019 with ongoing partnership co-financed by IBM and aims to support Hello Tractors’s business to connect small-scale farmers to equipment and data analytics for better crop production. The online platform will use a digital ledger and machine learning to measure, track and share data while “creating end-to-end trust and transparency across the agribusiness value chain”, according to an IBM release. Impressively enough, Digital Wallet will garner remote and IoT-based weather-sensing capabilities and AI to help farmers determine crops and inputs, choose when to plant and optimize and predict crop yields. IBM and Hello Tractor’s Digital Wallet will also retrieve data from fleet owners entailing tractor use, track and predict repairs, servicing and build credit profiles to open bank financing for farmers. This Blockchain and AI-based solution is a step in the right direction towards tackling agricultural and the many complexities faced within its industry. Many different variables exist within the realm of processes and resources, which makes an application like Hello Tractor a great start to providing turnkey solutions, despite being a hairline aid within agribusiness. Click here to read the full article Amazon Web Services has announced a new blockchain service during its re:lnvent event. Amazon Managed Blockchain is a service platform that allows it’s clients to build cloud-based blockchains, using Hyperledger fabric or Ethereum as templates. Clients can expect a fully managed service that makes it easy to facilitate and manage blockchain networks. Furthermore, “Amazon Managed Blockchain eliminates the overhead required to create the network, and automatically scales to meet the demands of thousands of applications running millions of transactions”, as quoted by Amazon Web Service. AMB (Amazon Managed Block) is currently in preview, and those already register with AWS can sign up. If approved, members will be able to create a blockchain network. Although companies like ConsenSys and IBM have initiatives to provide services like BaaS (blockchain as a service) already, AMB (Amazon Managed Block) will surely provide an advantage by being a bit more agnostic with framework options. Amazon is one of the leading companies in cloud services, and being able to provide blockchain as a service will only expand their scope of services as blockchain is set to soon scale the industrial world. Click here to read the full article China has launched it’s first ever Internet Court in Eastern Chinese City Hangzhou and will leverage blockchain to fight plagiarism for online writers, a local Chinese news outlet reports (china.org.cn). The court will deal with internet related cases to save time and reduce overhead costs of getting justice out of the system. Blockchain will be utilized as a means to store evidence, and will legally be recognized as a viable documenting method by judicial courts. The decision to make blockchain a form of storing evidence stemmed from a case in which the plaintiff, a company based in Hangzhou, sued the defendant, a Shenzhen-based technology firm for making publications of the plaintiff’s copyrighted material on it’s official website. The Plaintiff screen captured the website and sourcing codes of the defendant and uploaded them to the bitcoin blockchain. After investigations were conducted by Hangzhou Internet Court and ruled in favor of the plaintiff, it was later ruled that this form of electronic data would henceforth serve as a form of evidence in copyright infringement cases. The Hangzhou Internet Court is definitely taking the right approach in solidifying evidence in copyright infringement prevention using blockchain. This could very well set the tone for many entities and encourage those bodies to consider other methods of storing documents immutably, as well as the security of sensitive data. Click here to read the full article Earlier this year, the state of West Bengal had announced that they would soon begin to issue blockchain-based birth certificates. Following this initiative, one-month-old Divit Biyani has become the first baby born in India to receive a blockchain based birth certificate. This was made possible through the Bankura Municipal Corporation and Durgapur Municipal Corporation combining effort with a Netherlands-based startup, Lynked.World. The blockchain firm provided and developed an app which would allow both municipals to issue blockchain-based birth certificates, and successfully so. Although India’s government is opposed to cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology on the contrary sparks quite the enthusiastic response from officials. With various blockchain initiatives taking place, we can expect degree issuance, authentication of pharmaceuticals and subsidies to farmers all to become a reality.

HIGH-TECH PRAYER BREAKFAST = A STUPID WASTE OF TIME,Written by Todd Miechiels," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Todd Miechiels Follow -- Listen Share That’s what I thought 15 years ago. I was the co-founder of Medium Blue, a B2B Search Engine Agency. Sure I was a nice guy. I served people, tried to do the right thing. I loved networking as much as the next guy, but a “prayer breakfast”? Come on. That’s what the Holy Rollers, Bible Thumpers, Street Preachers, and Jesus Freaks do. High Tech Ministries is hosting their annual prayer breakfast October 12th in Atlanta. You may be attending, you may have been invited, or you may never have heard of it. Either way, I wanted to share my story about it. Bo Simmons invited me to my first one 15 years ago. I wasn’t interested in Jesus, I had fallen away from the church after middle school, but the networking seemed like it would be good. The next year Kathy Jaques invited me and I heard a great speaker, saw some friends I haven’t seen in a while, and went back to work. The next year Andy Williams invited me to sit at his table. They gave each of us a little pocket-sized Gospel of John, which I politely put in my suit pocket. It would stay there for another two years until I found it while taking the suit to the dry cleaners. I was depressed, lost, hopeless, and looking for a way out. I had been essentially forced to sell my share of the agency, had more money in the bank then I ever thought I’d have, and went from being with people 50 hours a week, to sitting completing by myself with the shades lowered in a tiny room for months after the sale. I was searching for answers. Zen, Wayne Dyer, Oprah, Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff, meditation, you name it. While reading that Gospel of John in my hand on a front stoop of a building in Tucker, searching HARD for an answer or way out of my misery, I felt an almost PHYSICAL rush go through my body, like a freight train passing me by. I had never experienced anything like it before or since. At that moment in tears, and quietly, but outloud I said “God it’s yours. I’m yours. I’m tired of running from you. I’m tired of hiding from you. I’m tired of trying to do things my way, to please others. I surrender.” It wasn’t just that book, or those invites to the prayer breakfast. It was my parents and so many others raising me in a loving Christian home and church, it was God putting guys in my life like Kevin Shaw, Art Foster, Dale Huff, Dan McDade, that took the time to answer questions I had, or demonstrate the love of Christ. Looking back I realize God was pursuing me along. Being a Christian has been no bed of roses, I have more questions now then when I started. Why are “christians” so full of hate, selfishness, divisiveness? Why don’t ‘christians’ act and sound more like Jesus? Why are so many churches ran like businesses and enterprises? Why does our country have so much when, others have so little, when our country has all but turned our backs to God? Following Jesus can feel like walking on a tightrope with a 100 MPH wind and no safety net. Having a personal relationship with the living Jesus, is the ONLY thing that keeps me going. And it’s only in Him that I’m content and satisfied and at peace in NOT knowing the answers to all the questions. If this all sounds like rubbish and nonsense. I completely understand. It would have to me too. All I can tell you is when I sought Him, He found me. When I knocked, He answered. It wasn’t the knock of a curious thinker, or a cynic or a skeptic, or someone looking for a magic bullet, I had knocked all those ways over the years. It was the knock of a broken and empty heart who finally admitted that he needed a Savior. If you’re still reading this, it’s probably because you were meant to, it’s no accident. If you can make it to this year’s breakfast, DO IT. Whether you think it’s stupid or not. Whether you think you’re too busy or not. And if you are a follower of Christ and reading this, there are people in your life you know don’t have a relationship with Jesus, PLEASE invite them. They may think it’s stupid, but they won’t think you’re stupid, only that you care enough about them to have invited them. YOU may be one that God wants to use. Don’t worry about what happens, you may never know the outcome or result in this lifetime. I’m grateful that through technology and testimony, I can witness and give thanks to some who took the time and care that led to not only my salvation, but my calling to ministry (and that’s whole other story). What is it that God may be wanting you to know about this? Turn away from the screen, take 3 deeeeeepp breaths and ASK Him. Even if that sounds stupid :) Peace and love, Todd -- -- Founder of The 3:15 Project and StoryDrive. Student of Abiding and Obeying, One Day at a Time.

Time travelling: taking a glance at the state of WearOS in 2019,"Design -,UI -,Notification Support -,Battery Life -,Fitness and Sports Tracking -,Apps -,In Summary,,Written by Luke Hammond"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Luke Hammond Follow -- Listen Share Ever since I was 12 I’ve walked the streets with a smartwatch on my wrist. Beginning with the original Sony Smartwatch, the idea of donning a piece of technology on my wrist was originally more of a statement to my inner techie than a helpful utility. As I grew with age and transitioned into more unconventional accessories such as the Omate Truesmart, I began to appreciate the power of having a tiny computer on my wrist. Fast forward 5 years and the smartwatch is still a minuscule niche in the watch and wearable market, dominated by (cough, cough), the Apple Watch. Google themselves attempted to pave the way back in 2014 with their Android Wear operating system, releasing it on devices such as the Moto 360 and LG Watch. Early devices seemed to favour function over form, but even then these slightly underpowered wearables soon became shadowed by Apple’s own offering. Re-branded to WearOS last year, Google’s operating system is favoured by more luxury brands such as Fossil, Tag Heuer and recently, the likes of Hublot and Mont Blanc. Their bid, to capture the hearts and minds of both techies and watch lovers alike. Their fiercest competition? The Samsung Galaxy Watch. After its own offering in Gear Live, Samsung veered away from the sinking ship of Android wear with the release of its highly renowned Gear S2 watch in 2015. Here Samsung revolutionised the navigation of such devices with a rotating crown and their intuitive Tizen operating system. The only problem was third-party app support. Three iterations later at the Galaxy Watch and we are still plagued with the same issue. Since September I have been wearing the 42mm Galaxy Watch on my wrist, and I’m more than impressed. Whether it the intuitive navigation, the useful widgets or the health tracking, the Galaxy watch is more than a contender in the smartwatch game. To try and keep up with the likes of Samsung and Apple, Google released WearOS 2.1 with an updated notification interface and new home screens emphasising a new focus on Google Assistant and the fresh-faced Google Fit. Over the past few weeks, I’ve removed my Galaxy Watch and booted up my Gen 1 Huawei Watch to see how this new visage of WearOS can be stacked up compared to its fiercest rival; here are my thoughts. Quick disclaimer: WearOS is best experienced on a newer device, so some of what I describe below may be different to that of current gen smartwatches. All of the comparisons I am making are my own opinions from my own experiences from the devices on hand to me. This is NOT a definitive guide to Wear OS vs Tizen. As you can probably tell from the title of this piece, I’m slightly biased towards Tizen and think that WearOS is an ageing dinosaur, but then I am using it on a fossil like the Huawei Watch. Despite being a good 2 years old, I still feel that my Huawei Watch is stunning with its stainless steel styling, more Omega than Computer. Ok, I did switch out my ageing leather band for a shiny new mesh one, but there still something about the more executive and dressy look that tickles my taste buds. I’m not saying I don’t like the look of the Galaxy Watch, and to be fair the Galaxy Watch is more of an active companion than an executive timepiece. My 42mm model comes in all black, with a rubber strap. This is beneficial as it means with its 5ATM water resistance and MIL810-G durability rating, this smartwatch can really take a beating. That’s one thing I like more about that Galaxy Watch; the fact that I don’t have to worry about it. With the Huawei Watch, I always felt I had to be careful with it, particularly on close encounters with water. Although it does have an IP67 rating, I just didn’t feel as comfortable as I do with the Galaxy Watch on my wrist, particularly when I had the leather strap installed. Now you can’t talk about the Galaxy Watch without addressing it’s most raved about feature; the rotating bezel. Forget Apple’s digital crown, Samsung’s bezel is where it’s at. Nothing feels more natural than taking a twist and seeing the round UI on the screen twist with it. To match this, every aspect of the UI is based around this movement, with everything from app icons to the menus being circular. From the watch face, a twist of the crown takes you to your widgets on the right, and notifications on the left. The widgets help display a selection of information from apps, such as calendar events or your progress towards that day’s fitness goals, without having to enter the app itself. Navigation is smooth and simple, although the placement of the home (bottom) and back (top) buttons for some reason still confuses me. The old version of WearOS was clunky and slow; there was nothing really intuitive about it. A press of side button would take you to the app selector, and a longer press to Google Assistant. Through swiping left or right you could change your watch face, then up or down to view your notifications, and lastly down from the top to access quick settings. Functional, but nothing special. With the new update, Google attempts to address this by making better use of swiping gestures. Although the button presses achieve the same result, with a swipe from the right you are presented with a new Google Fit dashboard. This dashboard fits in line with the newly revamped Fit formula, presenting you with 2 rings showing your progression to your move minute and heart point goals, along with a running total of the how many steps you’ve made that day. Swiping to the other side, you can now find a new dedicated hub for everything Google Assistant. Similar to the Google Now of old, this hub presents you with everything you’ve got going on in your day, from calendar events and reminders to deliveries and flights (taken from Gmail of course). One of the main reasons why most people buy a smartwatch is for the satisfaction of feeling a little buzz on your wrist whenever an alert comes through on your phone, even if the phone itself is on silent. On the Galaxy Watch, one simple twist of the bezel to the left takes you to the list of notifications, and then a tap of the touchscreen takes you deeper. In the case of messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, this gives you a preview of the chat feed, and options to reply using the on-screen keyboard, voice dictation and even a selection of smart replies. With email apps such as Gmail, it allows you to read the entirety of the email, using the bezel as a scroll wheel. In comparison, WearOS uses the same tried and tested formula that has worked for them since the days of Android Wear. Notifications appear as a list which can be accessed by swiping up from the watch face. The list gives you a small preview of the app, the title and content of the notification, nicely accented by that app’s colour scheme as per Google’s material design language. Like the majority of smartwatch OS’, pressing into the notification you can read deeper into a notification’s contents and gain a few options for interaction as with the Galaxy Watch. At times the list as per WearOS can be a little clunky and messy, especially when there are more than a few notifications to scroll through. In comparison to Tizen, this functions in the largely the same way but actually benefits over the Galaxy Watch due to the full Qwerty keyboard, compared to the telephone keypad and awful predictive text used by Samsung. Overall, I haven’t really found any issues notification wise with either of the offerings, but then there aren’t really many places where they can go wrong. As I have found with most smartwatches, battery life is a very similar story. With my regular daily routine, and then switching the device off before bed I am usually able to get 2 days of battery life out of both devices. The efficiency of the Huawei watch battery has slightly dwindled over time, but then that is to be expected with all mobile devices; so all things considering, it is holding up pretty well. The place where the Galaxy Watch really triumphs is the battery saver. On my Huawei watch, the battery saver would usually only give me maybe an extra few hours of battery, allowing me to make it to bed without it dying on me; with my Galaxy Watch its a whole different story. At 15% battery, I get a notification warning me of my low battery and asking if I want to enable power saving mode. In this mode, the OLED screen is reduced to black and white, so only the bare necessary pixels are being lit. It also turns off lift to wake and limits the user to a simple watch face with time, date and steps. On top of this, app functionality is reduced to the phone app for any emergency calls. Despite the clear lack functionality, after forgetting to charge my watch the night before, I was still able to get a full days usage on under 15% battery, with 6% still left by midnight; by far this is one of my features of the Galaxy Watch. One of the main reasons why the majority of people purchase wearable devices is to use as a fitness and sports tracker. Whether you’re a hardcore athlete looking for rich running metrics, or someone who simply wants to see how many steps they do, there is something for everyone. Despite having similar capabilities, in theory, this is one area in which the 2 devices clearly differ. The Huawei Watch mainly relies on using Google’s recently updated Fit platform. It provides the typical steps data and allows users to track a few cardio workouts including runs and bike rides. The service now also tracks its own new metrics of heart points and move minutes, in collaboration with the World Health Organisation (WHO), to give users a better idea of their weekly activity. Even though you can add workouts details after they have been completed, Google Fit is better suited to fitness novices and those who simply want steps and the occasional run. For those who are a bit more sport mad, the Galaxy Watch would be a preferable option; with the latest version of Tizen, Samsung continues with their work in the Gears Sport and Fit 2 Pro offering users a plethora of activities to chose from. From the pool to the bench press, the Galaxy Watch has you covered, being able to track over 30 different activities. Within each, providing metrics from calories and distance to reps and sets. Being not as active as I used to, I mainly use my Galaxy Watch for the more advanced fitness tracking, automatically recording my long walks and keeping track of my cycling in the gym. I have attempted to use the rep counting feature for exercises such as lat pull downs, but the watch never seemed to recognize my starting position. Whether this is to do with how I am moving my arms, or an issue with the watch I don’t know, but I will continue to test this for other exercises. Lastly, the addition of sleep and stress tracking makes the Galaxy Watch more compelling as a general health and fitness device. Metrics such as sleep stages mean that the Galaxy Watch is able to keep up with popular devices such as those from Garmin and Fitbit. Rich features such as these leave no room for my Huawei Watch to rival, hence I much prefer wearing my Galaxy Watch for day-to-day activity. One of the most compelling attractions of buying a smartwatch is the promise of third-party app support, allowing interactions with your favourite apps to complete tasks without having to take out your smartphone. Being the direct wearable counterpart to Android, WearOS has distinctly more apps found within its store than Tizen. From Any.do to Outlook, WearOS almost has it all, making it considerably more attractive than the Galaxy Watch in terms of app support as there is a higher chance the apps you love will be able to supply some sort of functionality on your device. What is attractive about the suite of apps found on the Galaxy Watch is the (almost) exclusive native support for some popular services that are yet to make their way to WearOS with the same functionality. For music lovers, Samsung are lucky enough to boast full Spotify support from streaming to offline services for those users with a premium subscription, and a more recently released app for Tidal users. Although these apps are not great (I have had a considerable struggle in getting the Spotify app working and have read some not so great reviews of the Tidal app), they do function and propose a feature that on WearOS is strictly limited to Google’s own Play Music service. In addition to music, Samsung also gives sport and fitness fanatics native apps for the entire Under Armour suite of apps, including a year of their premium service for all new users to the device, and Strava. As with the music apps, the extent of their functionality is that they work; none of them does anything particularly special, and in some cases are difficult to set up when logging into accounts, but some of that could be in part due to the fact I am using a OnePlus device and not a Samsung phone. The stock apps found on the device function far better than those from third parties; I frequently find myself using the timer when I am cooking and Samsung Pay to buy my Lunches. Being close to Android, app support is truly where WearOS triumphs over Tizen; it is clear that Samsung is trying to gain more support from third parties, but at the moment it’s not quite there. Going back to using my Huawei Watch has been an interesting experience. There are still many features of the device that I enjoy using; the integration with Google Fits step tracking is perfect for my light day to day activity, and the more elegant design makes the timepiece appropriate for more dressy occasions. Despite that, I don’t think my Huawei Watch will earn a permanent spot back on my wrist. The Galaxy Watch is a great device, that marries a functional, yet still attractive, design with an intuitive UI. Notification support is as expected and the more advanced fitness features are on par, if not better than those offered by Google Fit; the addition of sleep tracking makes the device a serious competitor to the likes of Garmin and Fitbit. My only gripe with the device is the poor selection of apps and the fact that the apps it does offer work poorly or are a mission to set up. In fairness, I am probably using the wrong device with the Galaxy Watch, as a Samsung smartphone would open up a slightly wider selection of apps and functionality. Regardless of the issue with apps, I still prefer the Galaxy Watch due to its intense fitness features and intuitive UI resulting from the rotating bezel. In truth, WearOS is still a viable option for those using Android, with more current devices boasting NFC and a slightly better looking UI due to updated processing and memory. In the future, I hope both operating systems are able to improve and give users more powerful features and apps, but for now, I am going to keep the Galaxy Watch on my wrist, and will continue to do so until WearOS catches up. -- -- Aspiring Marketer who loves to write things - Editor at Roadie Live Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*Vv-UcSQfJ9OIRsKALS8pEg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*2PescKmWgyoO9gh7W2Y3dQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*Vv-UcSQfJ9OIRsKALS8pEg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*yuVzMhCJyDENbyhwAsrkwA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Vv-UcSQfJ9OIRsKALS8pEg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*PiCjmecTN6f4Kvrx', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Vv-UcSQfJ9OIRsKALS8pEg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*OGRueT1TTtVXi2vAafWz8g.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Vv-UcSQfJ9OIRsKALS8pEg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*yuVzMhCJyDENbyhwAsrkwA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Vv-UcSQfJ9OIRsKALS8pEg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*cBIFfjjqzx8pzaemnAM0rQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*EhiV5eo34TIkvI6u-JFYmg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@LHammondWriting?source=post_page-----9158390e91b2--------------------------------,0,11 min read

Will Artificial Intelligence Be More Intelligent Than Humans?,Written by Marten Cats," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Marten Cats Follow -- 1 Listen Share Let me regale you with a tale as old as time. Our story begins almost 4 billion years ago in the primordial soup of baby Earth’s oceans. “We are the pinnacle of life!” exclaimed the single celled organism. “All of our friends are single celled, our parents were single celled and our progeny will be single celled. Nothing that comes from us will ever be more than single celled!” Then multi-celled organisms appeared. “We are the pinnacle of life!” exclaimed the multi-celled organism. “All of our friends, well most of our friends, are multi-celled. Our parents were multi-celled and our progeny will be multi-celled. Nothing that comes from us will ever be more than multi-celled!” Then complex multi-cellular organisms appeared. “We are the pinnacle of life!” exclaimed the jellyfish. “All of our friends, well most of our friends, are complex multi-cellular organisms. Our parents were complex multi-cellular organisms and our progeny will be complex multi-cellular organisms. Nothing that comes from us will ever be more than another complex multi-cellular organism!” Then the first backboned fish appeared. “We are the pinnacle of life!” exclaimed the fish. “All of our friends, well most of our friends, are fish. Our parents were fish and our progeny will be fish. Nothing that comes from us will ever be more than just another fish!” Then life appeared on land. “We are the pinnacle of life!” exclaimed the amphibian. “All of our friends, well most of our friends, are amphibians. Our parents were amphibians and our progeny will be amphibians. Nothing that comes from us will ever be more than just another amphibian!” Then reptiles left the water altogether. “We are the pinnacle of life!” exclaimed the reptile. “All of our friends, well most of our friends, are reptiles. Our parents were reptiles and our progeny will be reptiles. Nothing that comes from us will ever be more than just another reptile!” Then mammals appeared, and with them, humans. “Fire is the best source of light!” exclaimed the human. “Everyone I know uses fire to see in the dark. My parents used fire and my progeny will use fire. Nothing will surpass fire’s lighting abilities!” Until the light bulb did. “Horses are the fastest way to get around!” exclaimed the human. “Everyone I know rides a horse. My parents rode horses and my progeny will ride horses. Nothing will surpass the horse’s speed!” Until the automobile did. Or the train. Take your pick. “Humans are the smartest entities around!” exclaimed the human. “Humans always beat machines when playing Chess. My parents could beat a machine in a game of Chess and my progeny will be able to beat a machine in a game of Chess. Nothing we create will surpass human skill in the game of Chess!” Until Deep Blue did. “No matter!” shouted the human. “Chess playing machines can only play chess. Humans can play Chess, Go and Shogi too! My parents could play many different games and my progeny will be able to play many different games. Nothing we create will surpass the general game playing skills humans possess!” Until AlphaZero did (it mastered Chess, Go and Shogi). “No matter!” shouted the human, louder still. “AlphaZero can only play games. Humans can drive cars, write music, converse in natural language and create impressive machines like AlphaZero. My parents possessed a general intelligence and my progeny will also possess a general intelligence. Nothing we create will surpass human general intelligence!” Then artificial intelligence appeared. -- -- 1 Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*6IJvx7y0jyzeDXuM.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:711/1*vGNnYhxGLZ6TEOhrU0Oz7Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*KHufQT2hFAX4aEEakEBqbQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*_0NQUI1w3aPoR3TXysI1_g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*rPDTUgpT0O2wmKFSxyBjiA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:798/1*Ni8uXwdav1jktLBTN5kSLA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/0*6IJvx7y0jyzeDXuM.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*H6vN6WK9BA8VHDT8x_lgOg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*6IJvx7y0jyzeDXuM.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*sziuOZhi9S_ByVc2hIAPHQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*6IJvx7y0jyzeDXuM.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*pm6lq4pZLGVcvRlnTjm6pQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*6IJvx7y0jyzeDXuM.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*yuVzMhCJyDENbyhwAsrkwA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*6IJvx7y0jyzeDXuM.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*vzu3JPzaq2EZKTZNY9BhLA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*lEmL62oZdrOOWIzAAFKiFg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*i2zLIwC9mftamP1dbciCeQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*TQlEMeYwwWc38Wqm7EfCTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*0-N4JrXpZG1KJfIrAutd3A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*nChshyHhYer985FIUWu6TA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*maC8NLpto3tNwluhoRODsw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@martencats?source=post_page-----6c59a09dfb53--------------------------------,3,4 min read
A Simple Guide to Digital Signage,"Written by Vanessa Bernauer,What exactly does Digital Signage mean?,Who is Digital Signage for?,How does it work?,Five reasons not to ignore Digital Signage,Digital Signage versus traditional signage,What features do I need?,How much does it cost?,Three tips for creating compelling Digital Signage content,Get in touch"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Vanessa Bernauer Follow Screenspace -- 1 Listen Share Times Square and Piccadilly Circus have been synonymous with brightlyilluminated signs for nearly 100 years, captivating visitors with the logos andslogans of the world’s biggest brands. But, in the last few years, there has been a sea change. Fuelled by Internetconnectivity and the increasing availability of low-cost screens, Digital Signage is no longer restricted to major brands with budgets to match.So where does that leave you, and your business? If, like many, you have been watching the Digital Signage revolution from thesidelines (or maybe you have even stuck your toe in the water) — then this guide will provide you with a solid foundation so you’re ready to take the plunge. The term Digital Signage covers a confusingly broad range of technology, from electronic signs at a bus stop, right up to the huge screens you might find at a sports stadium. Ask an industry expert and he will tell you that Wow!Put simply, Digital Signage enables you to create and display any kind of content on one or more TV screens — all centrally controlled through thesoftware. There are very few types of business where you won’t find Digital Signage being effectively employed today. If there was a case for an advertising poster or an information board, there’s now a case for a digital signage screen that will do the job more effectively. Seven places you’ll find Digital Signage RetailIf you’re selling to the public, you’ll sell more with Digital Signage! Communicate special offers and promotions to your customers while they’re exactly where you want them — in your store. EventsIn an environment where messages need to be frequently updated, or intemporary locations, Digital Signage provides the flexibility you need. HealthcareIn hospitals, medical practices and dental surgeries Digital Signage is being used to provide timely information, promote awareness and greatly reduce perceived waiting times. Hotels & hospitalityNo longer the sole domain of premium establishments, Digital Signage is noweffectively employed in many hotel lobbies, conference facilities, spas, bars and restaurants. Fitness & wellbeingWith a constant roster of changing class schedules to advertise along with event promotions, club news and other health-related information, Digital Signage is very widely used CorporateDigital Signage provides a highly effective means of improving corporatecommunication and increasing motivation among business teams. EducationMuch more effective than a noticeboard, Digital Signage will inform students and parents about school events. A typical Digital Signage set-up will consist of three elements: Screens A normal TV is enough to get started. Digital Signage playersOne per screen, usually a small box attached externally but sometimes builtinto some Smart TVs. SoftwareA Content Management System for creating your content and sending it toyour screens. Digital Signage systems range from the super-simple to the exceedinglycomplex. The one that’s right for you will depend on your needs, and yourbudget. Usually, your Digital Signage players will need to be connected to the internet, either by WiFi or Ethernet, so that your software can deliver the content that you have created. Most Digital Signage software enables you to easily create adverts from text,images and logos. Often you can use video and animations to make your content more appealing. In an increasingly competitive world, it’s more important than ever to make sure that you communicate effectively with your audience, whoever they are. Here’s why you can no longer ignore the power of Digital Signage as a medium for doing so: It gets resultsAll the evidence shows that Digital Signage is more effective than printed material at grabbing the attention of your audience. Furthermore, recall of Digital Signage ads is higher than almost any other kind of advertising. All this translates to more profit on your bottom line. It’s flexibleHave you ever wished you could change your printed ads at different times of the day, or make the space on the wall work harder by displaying more than one ad at a time? Digital Signage gives you the flexibility to do both at the click of a mouse. It’s better for the environmentChange your ads as often as you like without incurring any printing or delivery costs, and without generating any waste. Today’s energy-saving LED screens are extremely efficient so your running costs are low. It’s easy to get startedSwitching to Digital Signage is easy — you can even re-use your existing content! Some systems offer a range of templates to help you get started so all you need to do is edit the text and add a logo. It’s surprisingly affordableThe initial investment in Digital Signage is surprisingly low given the tumbling cost of TV screens. Prices vary widely for Digital Signage players and software but if you make sure you’re not paying for sophisticated features that you won’t necessarily need, the running costs can be very modest and will often be outweighed by the savings on printed material. Why digital signage knocks spots off old-fashioned printed signage… Usually, your Digital Signage players will need to be connected to the Internet, either by Wi-Fi or Ethernet, so that your software can deliver the content that you have created. Most Digital Signage software enables you to easily create adverts from text,images and logos. Often you can use video and animation effects to make your content more appealing. Some systems allow use of widgets for weather, social media and news too. Others will provide a selection of free or paid templates that give you a head-start in your content-creation. More sophisticated Digital Signage software allows the scheduling of playlists so that you can display different content at different times during the day or week. Generally speaking, the more sophisticated the feature-set you are buying, the more expensive your Digital Signage solution will be. It is remarkable how much you can do with a simple solution. Our top takeaways:Consider carefully what features you really needStart simple: you can always upgrade to a more sophisticated solution later. The cost of your Digital Signage setup will usually break down into twoelements: One-off costsYour upfront investment will generally need to cover your screens, Digital Signage players & any installation and configuration. Sometimes some of these costs are bundled into the recurring costs (see below). Recurring costsNormally you will pay a recurring cost for access to, and use of, the Digital Signage software that runs your system. Sometimes this includes the cost of the players and sometimes not — take care to compare like for like. Recurring costs can be as low as £10/month per screen or ten times that for sophisticated systems. Be sure to check the minimum contract term too, to avoid getting tied into a solution before you have properly evaluated it. When designing content for your Digital Signage, normal graphic designprinciples apply — but there are some specific principles that you should bear in mind too: 1. Address your audienceGet your message across in 2–3 seconds, unless it’s a waiting or queuingenvironment in which case you can provide more depth. 2. Make it dynamicAds featuring video or animation content perform considerably better thanstatic ads — but be careful not to overdo it! 3.

Everything You Need to Know About the Tribune Publishing Cyberattack,Written by PCMag," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in PCMag Follow PC Magazine -- Listen Share Printing operations at the Los Angeles Times, the San Diego Union-Tribune, and all Tribune Publishing newspapers were disrupted over the weekend by a widespread cyberattack, reportedly traced back to the Ryuk ransomware. By Rob Marvin Over the weekend, a cyberattack disrupted print newspaper distribution across the US. The Los Angeles Times said a malware attack on Tribune Publishing’s software systems delayed weekend distribution of the newspaper and affected Tribune publications throughout the country. The print editions of the Baltimore Sun, Capital Gazette, Chicago Tribune, Hartford Courant, and a number of other Tribune-owned papers were published on Saturday without classified ads and death notices, according to the publications. The attack also affected the San Diego Union-Tribune, the South Florida Sun Sentinel, and distribution of The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, the West Coast editions of which are printed at the company’s LA facility. Distribution of smaller local California papers including the Glendale News Press and Burbank Leader was also affected. A source inside Tribune Publishing told the L.A. Times the company believes the attack originated outside the U.S. and was intended to disable infrastructure rather than steal information. The company sold both the L.A. Times and San Diego Union-Tribune earlier this year, but the newspapers still rely on Tribune Publishing’s production platform and printing networks, the target of the cyberattack. None of the publications’ websites or online editions were affected, and the company said no subscriber personal data was compromised. The company’s official statements stopped short of providing further details about the attack, but anonymous sources told the L.A. Times that the Ryuk ransomware may be a culprit. The same ransomware took down a North Carolina water utility in October. Ryuk, first described by security software provider Check Point over the summer, tends to hit high-value targets that can’t afford major downtime, demanding hefty Bitcoin ransoms. The New York Times said the group behind Ryuk, known as Grim Spider, has already been paid nearly 100 Bitcoin valued at more than $380,000 this month. It’s unclear whether any of that ransom came from Tribune Publishing. According to The New York Times report, Tribune first noticed a malfuctioning server this past Thursday night. It appeared to be contained but then spread throughout the company’s printing software systems on Saturday, debilitating operations and stymying page transmissions to Southern California printing presses. The company was able to resume on-time deliveries on Sunday, but it said the outage and attack were yet to be completely resolved. The company said it has reported the attack to the FBI, and a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said the agency is also investigating the situation. There has been some debate over the ransomware culprits. Check Point has linked Ryuk to North Korea’s APT Lazarus Group. Security firm CrowdStrike, on the other hand, told The New York Times it believes cybercriminals in Eastern Europe were behind the attack, which may be related to the nefarious TrickBot malware. This year alone, ransomware attacks have been responsible for crippling systems including the Newark and Atlanta city governments, the Port of San Diego, and clinical lab testing company LabCorp. Those attacks are linked back to the SamSam ransomware strain, which the US government has linked to Iran. The reported Tribune Publishing ransomware attack, whether ultimately traced back to North Korea, other nation-state actors, or hacker groups, marks the first known attack on major newspaper printing operations.

Ring In The New Year With Security Tools from MetaCert,"Don’t get blindsided by a scam; MetaCert will keep you safe from phishing attacks.,An Ecosystem Swarming With Threats,The Anatomy of the Scam,The Green Shield of Trust,$150 Worth Of MetaCert Tokens As A Special Bonus,Email Security,Written by Jeremy Nation"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Jeremy Nation Follow METACERT -- Listen Share Everywhere there’s a buck to me made someone is trying to cheat someone else, and while that unpleasant reality might not leave a good taste in your mouth, MetaCert has your back, with tools that will allow you to differentiate between legitimate web resources and scams. Forging into the new year, whether you’re just getting into cryptocurrency, or you’re a veteran hodler, chances are good you’ve heard about the ripoff schemes plied by malicious actors. Part of the problem lies with a mixture of sophisticated methods used by scammers paralleled with a sentiment of urgency that comes from the fear of missing out. These factors conflate with misinformation campaigns designed to ensnare newcomers to the scene. One of the things throwing fuel on the fire is a basic lack of understanding. People who are just getting inducted into the scene often do not know how to manage public versus private keys, or which cryptocurrency exchanges are the right ones to set up an account at, and how to move their digital assets to a cold storage wallet. This basic lack of understanding means people are likely to ask questions, which makes them targets for malicious actors who use misinformation to socially engineer an attack. Another problem is that supposedly trustworthy sources of information often fail to weed out the scammers. For instance, compromised Twitter accounts, sometimes even those verified by the platform itself, have been known to successfully place promotional ads featuring links to known phishing scams. If people see an advertisement for a cryptocurrency scam as a promoted tweet, they will be more susceptible to believing that type of scam is legitimate; while they may not fall for it immediately, they may later reference that instance and fall for a different scam, misinterpreting the information from seeing a scam in a promoted tweet. One hopes that eventually this issue is something that will be managed from the inside out as cryptocurrency systems begin to scale outwards and compete with legacy remittance systems. Once that happens the user interface side is less likely to feature hexadecimal code keys which can be difficult for the human eye to differentiate from another. Until that day comes, you can continue to rely on security tools from MetaCert. After a significant mainstream boom in 2017, nearly every chat service and social media site was crawling with crypto scammers to the point where MetaCert had to take action. Shortly after MetaCert developed tools for Slack that eradicated the phishing on the platform, MetaCert CEO and Founder Paul Walsh accurately predicted that scammers would migrate to another platform; Telegram. Again, MetaCert sprung into action, and created a bot that identifies dangerous resources such as malicious URLs and cryptocurrency addresses associated with phishing campaigns. Today, MetaCert’s powerful tools allow users to easily differentiate between legitimate and dangerous resources at a glance. Phishing scams today are often difficult to discern from their legitimate counterparts. In one case a user would have need a microscope to identify a tiny pixel above character to differentiate the scam site from the real one. Other times scammers use automated systems to get a green lock signifying SSL certification on their phishing site, and consumers fall for that. The truth is, without a valid verification system, it’s practically impossible to tell at a glance whether a site is safe or not until it’s too late. MetaCert has verified legitimate web resources with a green shield of trust, seen by subscribers to the Cryptonite browser plugin. That means you’ll see the green shield of trust whenever you visit a verified cryptocurrency related website, social media account, wallet provider, and/or cryptocurrency exchange. In 2018 we continued to expand our database of over 10 billion classified uniform resource identifiers across over 60 categories thanks to the participation of our community and our hard working team. In 2019 we intend to expand our verification services beyond crypto to encompass sites also targeted by phishing scammers including mainstream companies, payment portals, and more. Soon the green shield of trust will also signify you’re safe when you’re buying things online, paying bills, or otherwise managing finances through online banking services, so you’ll always know you’re in the right place on the web. Remember, if the shield is black, that means the site hasn’t been verified and might not be trustworthy, so use caution. Your subscription to Cryptonite today will get you more than a year’s worth of safety. For the first 2,000 subscribers to Cryptonite we’re offering $150 in MetaCert Tokens, to be distributed following the end of our public sale. You’ll know right away if you’re one of the first 2,000 subscribers: To subscribe to Cryptonite now, follow these instructions. MetaCert is still beta testing our email security tool that is sure to revolutionize the way you see links in your email. Many phishing emails contain links, or images with hyperlinks. MetaCert’s email security tool uses a color coded system to warn you against known threats, or potentially malicious links. Every link that appears in your email will feature a shield beside it; if the shield is green you’re safe, and if the shield is red you know it’s a phishing link. Again, if the shield is black, that means the resource hasn’t been verified, and that you should use extreme caution clicking on it. Sign up for our email security tool for iOS today, and see how we’re changing the way people see links in their email. This report was brought to you by MetaCert. Join the conversation with us on Telegram, and find out why MetaCert is the new shield of trust for web resources. You can also check out our white paper and technical paper, and follow us @MetaCert on Twitter.

Mobile apps in 2019–10 trends worth to be highlighted,"1. Chatbots,2. Machine learning,3. Multiplatform development,4. Augmented reality,5. Mobile payments and wallets,6. Escape from ecosystems,7. Instant Apps,8. Serverless backends,9. Data in the cloud,10. Motion and localization,Written by Adam Golański"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Adam Golański Follow -- Listen Share A year ago, studies by We are social and Hootsuite revealed that the number of internet users worldwide exceeded 4 billion and the number of mobile phone users exceeded 5 billion. The average internet user was supposed to spend six hours a day using devices connected to the Internet — a quarter of his or her life. To sum it up, it would mean that in 2018 humanity spent one billion man-years on the Internet. And there is no evidence that this trend is slowing down. More and more accessible mobile Internet, better and better smartphones make us believe that in 2019 we will be even more actively integrating the Internet into our lives. This will be primarily caused by mobile applications. While a few years ago there was a lot of talk about mobile Web, HTML5 standards, mobile browsers, today it is becoming more and more obvious that this is not the right way to go. Applications have won the users’ hearts, providing more convenient access to information, entertainment, and various practical functionalities. Mobile web became at best just an addition to the applications. Websites viewed on mobile browsers are first and foremost encourage users to install mobile apps. YouTube, Facebook, Reddit, Pornhub, Allegro… Although they still work in the browser, they only show their full potential on the smartphone through their client applications. The same applies to every online shop — it’s great to have a mobile website, but the conversion rate from it is far lower than from a desktop site. Even small e-shops are commissioning mobile apps in the hope that they will find a new home on the smartphone’s start screen. However, it is not only the convenience of the users that have influenced this situation. Another factor was the reduction in the cost of entering the market with a new mobile application. In 2018 only two mobile platforms remained on the market — iOS and Android. Mobile Windows, BlackBerry, Tizen or Firefox OS ceased to have any relevance. So there is no need to worry about them, no need to bear the additional costs of software development. Furthermore, React Native technology has reached maturity, thanks to which it is easy to build a mobile application that will work as well on Android as on iOS. It’s true, React Native has its limitations, but in the case of a typical enterprise or retail apps they’re not noticeable. And on the horizon, you can see one more solution. Wherever the budget is not sufficient even for creating a React Native application, it becomes possible to use Progressive Web Apps. This kind of software is installed directly from websites, without the involvement of app stores. In many cases, Progressive Web Apps can provide users with more or less the same experience as the native app. And most importantly, these apps work well enough not only on Android but also on iOS. With these factors in mind, it is not surprising that revenues from the global mobile apps market (the value of sales in stores and ads emission) are expected to reach almost 190 billion dollars in 2020. So what to expect from mobile apps in 2019? Here are the ten most important trends that we focus on in Matsuu: Nowadays more and more users prefer the self-service — this is especially visible in the B2B industry, but also individual customers like independence. Chatbots, acting as virtual assistants in sales applications, turn out to be the solution that will allow the customer to fully automate the contact with the store. According to Statista, the value of the chatbots market is expected to increase by more than a billion dollars in the coming years. They will become part of the normal user experience, their absence will be considered as something bizarre. On the one hand, it is the result of the arrival on the market the generation accustomed to communicators, on the other hand, the development of programming tools that allow the quick integration of chatbots with the existing applications. And due to the progress in artificial intelligence, with each subsequent interaction with the user, mobile apps will provide better and better responses through their chats. If we are talking about Artificial Intelligence, we must remember that it affects the progress of not only chatbots but also many other smartphone functionalities. Above all, this means machine learning, which allows the analysis of vast amounts of data to provide the users with a more personalized experience, and the publishers of applications with a better insight into the users’ needs. Speech recognition, image recognition, decision support, searching for the best offers — such solutions will be eagerly used in the new generation of mobile applications in the coming year. Gartner predicts that it will be the most important element of digital business in the coming years, whose value by 2022 will reach 3.9 trillion dollars. It is true the fact that only Android and iOS remained on the market has significantly reduced the cost of software development, but still, the need for separate software development for two systems constitutes a serious financial barrier for many customers. Fortunately, in the last two years, it became possible to meet the needs of those who do not have at their disposal large budgets thanks to React Native. However, it is obvious that this Facebook-made technology is not sufficient for all kinds of applications. Flutter, Google’s new framework for building visually spectacular multiplatform mobile apps, has no such limitations. With the release of its first stable version in December 2018, a new wave of beautiful and powerful apps is coming, and they can be immediately published on Google Play and App Store. For now, the challenge is to find programmers who are experienced enough with the still little-known Dart language. In this language, the Flutter apps are created and they use a number of its more advanced features. All these virtual reality goggles remain so far a curiosity for the gamers. They are simply too uncomfortable, too impractical to be used anywhere except for some types of games and perhaps a few specialized applications. However, 2019 will, in our opinion, be the year in which mobile applications will be eagerly upgraded with the technology that has grown up on the basis of VR, i.e. Augmented Reality (AR). Pokémon Go was not just a one-time fad. Thanks to the increasing performance of smartphones, it will be possible to create breathtaking mobile apps that supplement reality with additional layers of information on the fly. More and more companies will use AR to improve sales and customer communication. More and more applications will also follow Instagram and Snapchat and will be enhanced with interactive AR components, supported by Apple’s ARKit and Google’s ARCore technologies. This impresses users and is ideal for use in advertising and loyalty campaigns in social media. Year after year, our shopping habits are changing. We replaced cash with plastic credit cards, and then start replacing them with mobile wallets and cryptocurrencies. This is because easy payments are what customers require from all sales applications. And as mobile shopping has become the primary way for an increasing number of users to buy non-food items, solutions such as Google Pay are improving, allowing us to spend our hard-earned money quickly and safely. Thanks to them, smartphones are turning into our wallets. Now just wait for the digitalization of ID cards… In any case, according to BI Intelligence, by 2020, the value of payments made via mobile devices is expected to amount to 503 billion dollars. Apple has done everything it could to convince users to their FaceTime, even though it does not allow them to communicate with Android users. Building such closed “ecosystems” of software has become a trademark of Cupertino company, even though it has not brought the desired results. iMessage has no chance in terms of popularity with Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp available on every major platform. In this war between Apple and Google, users will increasingly choose multiplatform applications that allow for easy data transfer between systems. The main reason for this change is the desire of the younger generation to try something new from time to time. Who knows, maybe, in the end, iMessage will appear on Android, like Google Duo was released on iPhone? In 2017, Google introduced Instant Apps technology into Google Play — allowing users to try apps from the store immediately without the need to install them. Of course, not every application can be tested in this way, in most cases, these are equivalent to the websites. Google also allows you to easily share them with your friends. As users become more and more impatient, demanding shorter loading times, and 5G networks are still a distant future, apps will be offered more and more often in an instant form, thus eliminating the time needed to download them and install. The effects can be felt immediately — Vimeo has extended its average session time by 130 percent after being released in an instant app form! Serverless infrastructure is a booming pattern of software architecture, which eliminates the need to create and manage your own backends from scratch. Of course, this does not mean that mobile applications will not need servers. The service provider simply becomes responsible for all the essential resources involved in delivering and scaling the application runtime environment. Thanks to such solutions as Google Firebase, we can simply build new software faster and cheaper, and these apps can scale almost without limitations. There is, of course, a side effect here: the software is dependent on Google infrastructure and we’re no longer in full control of application development. But if self-reliance is important, one can always choose the open source serverless solution Parse. In any case, we are going in the direction of API management rather than management of servers. Internet speed is increasing faster than the amount of memory available in smartphones, especially those more affordable. We can still find devices with 16GB of built-in storage, especially in emerging markets. Meanwhile, more and more applications are storing large amounts of data, taking up space and causing the user to not be able to install further applications anymore. This means that the need to integrate applications with cloud data storage services will increase. Ultimately, we believe that applications will store more and more data, including multimedia data, not locally, but in the clouds. It will also increase the ease of exchanging smartphones for new ones and increase data security. Whatever you say, an ordinary user cannot take care of them as well as a specialized service provider. Bluetooth beacon technology appeared prematurely and failed to make a big impact on the market, but this does not mean that there is no need for this type of solutions. In 2019 an important trend in mobile applications will be motion detection and location. For this purpose, all possible techniques will be used to transmit accurate location data. Gyroscope, accelerometers, magnetometers, and GPS will be complemented with data from Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and 5G, allowing precise modelling of user movement in space, also in enclosed facilities. Motion and location detection apps can be used to pinpoint colleagues, save energy, protect against theft, and are suitable for games (including AR games), fitness, geotagging and navigation applications. These ten trends certainly do not cover the whole issue. In our industry, there are new breakthroughs occurring constantly. Smartphones and their software are solving more and more human problems, changing people’s everyday lives on a scale we could not have imagined in the previous century. We are already carrying out many of the most important tasks with the help of the apps. Shopping, travel, banking, dating, entertainment, news, sports, education, and even health check-ups have all been transformed by the software. What will be the next area of human life that can be changed with mobile applications? We believe that some surprises in this area are inevitable. -- -- Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*d7_aV6A1BmYAetkB.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/0*F6n-nt6oZKPcr-y6.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/0*d7_aV6A1BmYAetkB.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*dN3mjjmBDU2KC9Qd.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*d7_aV6A1BmYAetkB.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*d7_aV6A1BmYAetkB.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:240:161/0*dN3mjjmBDU2KC9Qd.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*RNYCdpBO4YrohRtTRX5z4A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*nqaMr-ZyGH9A8kk8RzbQcg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*6QHaAGV4bp_AAGctwP3x5w.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*4X37q9wlsqgHnYLSgmlNaA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*TQlEMeYwwWc38Wqm7EfCTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*0-N4JrXpZG1KJfIrAutd3A.png']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@a.golanski?source=post_page-----16b103f50b84--------------------------------,0,8 min read
Paradigm Shift in Corporate Banking on Blockchain Adoption,Written by Farhang Maghdeed," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Farhang Maghdeed Follow The Finterra Publication -- Listen Share Over the past thirty years, central banks focused on fighting inflation globally and have been failing. Given that inflation has been identified as the major culprit in most of the global depression since the 1920’s to today, no wonder most financial institutions have made it their target trying to control and manage it. However, it was the financial crisis of 2008 that led to deeper questioning of economic processes, credit system and debt management. The recession pointed out a gap in the public’ trust in financial institutions and governments due to the lack of transparency and accountability in financial world. The question on everyone’s mind is: will this stop, or it will continue? Are there any solutions out there that can prevent the collapse of financial fundamentals that are built around a centralised system? Not a question with an easy or short answer, but the smart money seems to be on blockchain architecture that is using cutting edge technology to build trust and transparency. Blockchain platform are attracting the attention of financial service sector to its innovative technology that is set to change the future and it has emerged as a new paradigm in the financial industry. In 2016, the World Economic Forum (WEF) predicted that blockchain will revolutionize financial services, and build a solid platform where consumers and producers / buyers and sellers will converge. The financial sector however, is apprehensive considering the technology’s link to cryptocurrencies and evolving blockchain technology use in other sectors. In 2017, the banking sector and remittance industry experienced industry disruptions and large-scale mergers. By the end of the year, a consensus between the banking sector and blockchain technologists were reached. In the first quarter of 2018 several banks started adopting and testing the technology in phases. Decentralised Ledger Technology (DLT) has created the “internet of value” by empowering peer to peer, transparent, immediate and almost free exchanges of value over the internet awakening the banking industry the real possibility of their demise and effectively killing the stranglehold they have on the financial markets, not a pretty thought if you are involved in the finance business. According to Statistics, from 2016 to 2021 it is estimated that blockchain technology is heating the global market aggressively, with the Blockchain industry market reacing 339.5 Million USD in size and is forecast to grow to 2.3 billion USD by 2021. Although banks and financial institutions have always been at the frontline of the technology evolution, it is very interesting to know they are preparing for a true battle. Who will win? Who will emerge triumphant and reap the spoils of war? It’s really too early to tell yet, but for Blockchain the future is bright. -- -- The Finterra Publication Experiences in Blockchain | Metaverse | Security Token | Fintech Analyst | Fintech Writer | Digital Economy Expert | Digital Finance & Economy writer| Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:7500/1*-VrbPJa3y6boVy2y6G5m7Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*-T9ZOp6pGanhk_ZsEZIHsA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*yIaRbiqMwGGAXR9ZMe2-dw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*-T9ZOp6pGanhk_ZsEZIHsA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*yIaRbiqMwGGAXR9ZMe2-dw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*6FJaAVSlTXg34NnYd2hikw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*-T9ZOp6pGanhk_ZsEZIHsA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*Psnka02MhnzVGphckMl13Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*e2fxqpSNScda2UQW-CcZcQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*caR7Emhf3oDrz8gvil3cPw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*e2fxqpSNScda2UQW-CcZcQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wwZxPrX9p4AYSEvbd7wpbQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*-T9ZOp6pGanhk_ZsEZIHsA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*QtSp-QdCNWNysIIwz-tQSA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*lOVIKQR7sxSghI8VuTAbHw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*dnXyohMVIFsRq2UtQyRD6g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*TGDWp9kQBbI7K_Ij.', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*-PS6oMeaJG5dRLPxg1L6PA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*ahIxB6HS49zEmm6AuHexYg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*eYh7bD3XhdEiolo2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*UOwQVZKhmz3S1YcACLqDvQ.jpeg']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@farhang.maghdeed?source=post_page-----da902318cff2--------------------------------,20,2 min read
Business models of Self-driving cars — Part 2,Written by Saurabh Gupta," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Saurabh Gupta Follow -- Listen Share Update: Part 1 sparked some interesting thoughts on social media and folks raved about interesting ‘car-as-a-service’ subscription offerings such as ‘Clutch’ in Atlanta, Mercedes, BMW, Porsche, Cadillac, and Volvo care starting at $600 per month. Toyota has also announced its plans to roll out a similar service in 2019. There was also a passionate perspective from Tesla/Chevy Cruze owners (or leasees) about the financial virtues of owning an EV. Back to the autonomous car business models. The real “software is eating the world” story of autonomous cars is the ‘Android’ style platform model led by a motley crew of tech players, auto component suppliers, and some innovative automakers. The Apple model of vertical integration is logical for incumbent auto giants and brings in technology capabilities to their current product line. However, a number of savvy companies are expanding their technology platform by licensing it to auto manufacturers. The Autonomous Technology Platform — The “Android” model The idea is pretty simple…Equip a regular car — new or existing with autonomous capabilities — by building a platform that combines the hardware/sensor/Lidars and the artificial intelligence brains. It is similar to buying a Samsung phone which at its heart is running Android O/S. By focusing on autonomous technology platform instead of the entire car, this strategy offers some unprecedented opportunities that have not seen daylight yet. The players here are diverse and fall largely in three different categories. The Young Turks — The first category members are auto ancillary manufacturers and allied industries that have the auto engineering know-how but tend to play at a lower spot in the auto manufacturing value chain. A classic example of this is Delphi/Aptiv. This segment has some interesting potential in the future, especially if/when it goes directly to the consumer. Imagine if they were to offer a hardware/software kit that can be installed in any modern car to make it autonomous. There is a massive incumbent market of non-autonomous cars and probably a lot of those folks would want to modernize their current chariots. With a traditional SAAS model for autonomous software/hardware’s continuing maintenance and an ‘over-the-air’ updates, combined with unlimited in-car wi-fi, auto-insurance etc., such offerings would probably result in a pretty large market cap business. Challenge — A lack of direct B2C type service delivery experience, limited understanding of software and digital interaction models may cause their offering to be too engineering like, and not have enough emphasis on end-user experience and ease of usage. The Tech Mongols — With deep technical roots to solve challenges of artificial intelligence and machine learning for autonomous driving, and equally deep pockets, these players are designing the future of transportation. These companies may have nothing to do directly with auto manufacturing but are the classic example of ‘software is eating the world’. Google/Alphabet’s WayMo and Uber fall in this category. Today, these players are focused on extending the current Uber/Lyft model and will upend the taxi market, but it won’t be surprising to see them also extend into the conversion opportunity for modern non-autonomous cars. It would seem more logical for Waymo than Uber to reach out into the existing car market, as an extension of Google’s relationship with users. After all, more data of where you go and what you do is lucrative for marketers — especially of those who are on non-Android devices and cannot be easily tracked. Challenge — Perhaps the biggest challenge for Waymo/Uber of the world is public perception and their ability to counter the apprehension of too much power in the hands of tech companies. The recent unease with social networks and Silicon Valley companies ever-increasing power is unsettling for politicians and public alike — and may cause a backlash that has nothing to do with the technical superiority of their platform. The Auto Moghuls — If you are one of the largest automakers and have made some decent inroads into the autonomous technology solution space, why not partner with your competitors and add more fuel to the autonomous platform race. GM is embracing this strategy with Honda to infuse more investment into their autonomous platform/newly sprouted start-up called Cruise. By pooling resources, this strategy enables GM and Honda to bring autonomous capabilities to their own vehicles, and also increase the sophistication of the platform itself. With their internal auto engineering expertise and world-class ability to commercialize these technologies on a global scale, Cruise will definitely be a platform to watch out for. In addition, this model lends itself well to the fleet of ‘Robo-taxis’ that GM seems interested in launching. Its the automakers getting in on Uber/Lyft/Waymo’s game. Also, for smaller automakers that do not have the economies of scope and scale for autonomous platforms, such as Subaru, Mazda, Nissan, and others, this is perhaps an attractive club to join. Challenge — Coopetition or collaborating with competitors comes with its own series of challenges. This business model has several advantages and as long as a clear framework of trust and governance is shared by the players, it can create a significant advantage. However, given the cut-throat competition in the auto market, this is a delicate balance to be maintained. Today’s car related customer service is largely deferred to dealers and other third parties — and it is a well-oiled channel management machine for most of the incumbent automakers. However, in the new world of autonomous cars — especially when they are running on a common platform, how will these services be delivered. Would they a better fit for a centrally managed call center, with sophisticated software integrations with the vehicles’ sensors and diagnostics that require a different type of skill set. How will it affect the brand perception and quality of service? It ain’t an oil change…Autonomous car users of tomorrow will want to press a button and be redirected to someone who can help with their car’s software — which may be rather different from the services that a dealer offers. Summary: The autonomous platform participants of the ‘Android’ model would need to significantly differentiate their end customer’s user experience to stay competitive in the marketplace. One can argue that cars themselves are the differentiation — as the non-autonomous ones are today. However, as we move into an era where we will drive less and tap on screens more, designing an end-user experience that hides the generic autonomous platform and offers a pleasant and branded experience will be key. The challenge with the ‘Android’ business model for autonomous vehicles is similar to the one that exists with Android phones — a clear lack of differentiation in the digital experience. As a technologist, it is a great era to be living in. As these tectonic shifts occur, we can merely marvel at the advancements that are occurring at a dizzying pace. Do join me in sharing your thoughts and comments on this, and if I missed some key areas. Thanks. -- -- Inspired by Creativity, Zen, Innovation, Technology, Data Privacy & Data Security for Salesforce & a burning desire to make the world a better place.

Understanding Diversity and Inclusion"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Charlie Oliver Follow TECH 2025 -- Listen Share In the two years since we first launched Tech 2025, back in January 2017, we’ve learned that the primary reason people attend our events on any given topic is because they are curious about the topic or a particular aspect of the topic that we highlight in our event marketing. Many of our attendees aren’t necessarily advanced in (or very knowledgeable about) the technologies we cover. They come to us curious, wanting to see something that sparks their internal, creative compass — even if they have no idea what that “something” might be. It’s safe to say that we’re all a bit overwhelmed with the number of disruptive emerging technologies emerging and developing simultaneously, each one promising to change global industries and the very nature of our reality in a mere next ten years: AI, machine learning, AR/VR/XR, 3D printing, autonomous vehicles, gene-editing biotech, robots, automation — oy! Where to begin?! Imagining the future and your place in it has never been so complicated. Knowledge is power, but curiosity is queen. As hard as it may sometimes be (we’re all busy and eternally distracted), in order to learn about the true potential impact of technology and to find our place in the ecosystem, we must feed our curiosity by constantly and substantively learning about the systems and ideas that are at the core of emerging technologies, including how global innovation happens, morals and ethics of businesses, corporate management and structure, societies and social science, etc. These technologies are challenging us to redefine who we are and what we want. The obvious question is: who are we and what do we really want? Don’t let your curiosity go to waste. It’s your most powerful tool. It’s the anchor that will steady you in turbulent times as technologies and big ideas come and go. Learn and relearn what you thought you already knew. Revisit old concepts, learn new ones, and challenge current systems and ways of thinking. You don’t necessarily have to jump into the deep-end of the pool by taking expensive, months-long, courses in AI and machine learning that will require technical expertise you don’t have or necessarily want right now. You can start the new year learning about concepts at the core of emerging technologies or the industries that are adopting them. With this knowledge, regardless of the market volatility, you’ll be able to think through what’s happening now, how the latest developments might impact your business, and what’s coming next. I’ve gathered a short list of free online courses that helps us to see “the big picture” and focus on the problems emerging technologies are being created to solve, as opposed to the technology itself (and even the problems that are arising as we implement technologies like algorithmic bias). I’ll be adding more to this list in parts 2 and 3 of this series in the coming weeks. Invite people in your network (friends, family, coworkers) to join you on this journey. It’s one well worth taking and a great way to kick off the new year! Università Bocconi on Coursera Started (started 24th Dec, 2018) We live in an increasingly interconnected world and the technologies of the near future will make us even more interconnected. As China, the US and other nations race to become leaders in AI, understanding international leadership and organizational behavior during technological transition will become crucial. This course is a great place to start. Course Description: Leaders in business and non-profit organizations increasingly work across national borders and in multi-cultural environments. You may work regularly with customers or suppliers abroad, or be part of a globally dispersed cross-functional team, or an expatriate manager on an international assignment. You may be a member of a global online community, or a development aid worker collaborating with an international network of partner organizations. In all of these contexts, your effectiveness as a leader depends on how well you understand and are able to manage individual and collective behaviors in an intercultural context. In this course… we’ll explore the theory and practice of international and intercultural leadership and organizational behavior. Presented by 23andme The world was horrified by the news that He Jiankui (a Chinese scientist) created the world’s first babies genetically modified with CRISPR (twin girls with a potential third baby on the way) and, if that weren’t enough to sound alarms, his work was (according to fellow scientists), sloppy and full of errors (Is the CRISPR baby controversy the start of a terrifying new chapter in gene editing?). The global science community is still grappling to understand the implications of this shocking story. Here’s how you can begin to understand the technology, why what Jiankui did was considered to be so dangerous, and how you can participate in the discussion — take this course! After you take this course, consider taking this edX course, Analyze Your Genome! Course Description: This course is a journey into the biology of the human genome and will highlight the scientific, social, and personal perspectives of people living with a variety of traits. You will learn about fundamental principles of inheritance, gene expression, mutation and variation, development of simple and complex biological traits, human ancestry and evolution, and the acquisition of personal genetic information. By the end of this course, you will be able to read and understand genetic information available from personal genetics services such as 23andMe. Presented by Microsoft (started December 31) The need for taking this course (and its potential benefits) is pretty self-explanatory. As AI and machine learning technologies take over every part of our society, contentious issues surround ethics and fairness will grow (particularly in corporate and government sectors). Here’s a great introduction to the legal framework around the topic. There are NO prerequisites for this course. Any and everyone can participate. Course Description: Analytics and AI are powerful tools that have real-word outcomes. Learn how to apply practical, ethical, and legal constructs and scenarios so that you can be an effective analytics professional. Corporations, governments, and individuals have powerful tools in Analytics and AI to create real-world outcomes, for good or for ill. Data professionals today need both the frameworks and the methods in their job to achieve optimal results while being good stewards of their critical role in society today. In this course, you’ll learn to apply ethical and legal frameworks to initiatives in the data profession. You’ll explore practical approaches to data and analytics problems posed by work in Big Data, Data Science, and AI. You’ll also investigate applied data methods for ethical and legal work in Analytics and AI. The University of Chicago (started December 31) Without a doubt, 2018 was the year of “Techlash” where big tech companies were challenged on their technologies, ethics and morals, by governments around the world, consumer advocacy groups, and even their own employees. How this all ends is anyone’s guess. We’ll be exploring this topic extensively at Tech 2025 this year. Here’s a great course that will lay a solid foundation for learning about how tiny startups become mega-platforms and achieve global dominance. Course Description: This seven-week course will explore the relationship between law and technology with a strong focus on the law of the United States with some comparisons to laws around the world, especially in Europe. Tech progress is an important source of economic growth and raises broader questions about the human condition, including how culture evolves and who controls that evolution. Technology also matters in countless other ways as it often establishes the framework in which governments interact with their citizens, both in allowing speech and blocking it and in establishing exactly what the boundaries are between private life and the government. And technology itself is powerfully shaped by the laws that apply in areas as diverse as copyright, antitrust, patents, privacy, speech law and the regulation of networks. This course will cover 7 topics: Microsoft: The Desktop vs. The Internet, Google Emerges (and the World Responds), Smartphones, Nondiscrimination and Network Neutrality, The Day the Music Died?, Video: Listening and Watching, The Mediated Book. KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm Elon Musk is promising to get us to Mars by 2025. Whether he will or won’t, the fact is, we’re headed to Mars one way or another regardless of who gets us there first (and it will be sooner than later). The privatization of space travel is creating opportunities for entrepreneurs to participate in space travel like never before. And companies like Space X and Virgin Galactic are accepting space tourists for the lucky few who can afford it. This course offers a great overview of the history of human space flight. If you want to be inspired by space tech, this course will give you that spark! Course Description: Learn about human space travel from an experienced ESA astronaut who flew on Space Shuttle Discovery to conduct research on the International Space Station. This applied science course introduces aspects of human spaceflight, including the various environmental, medical and technical challenges of space travel. Join Christer Fuglesang, Director of KTH Space Center, and European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut, during this 5-week course in which Christer makes human spaceflight both accessible and engaging. Christer often draws on his own experiences as an astronaut which include two Space Shuttle missions and five spacewalks. RWTH Aachen University (archived course) Course Description: Learn to take on competition by creating successful and innovative ideas for your business through a thorough understanding of your customers’ needs. Addressing the needs of your customers is the core factor of managing innovation successfully. Exactly this is the task of the first stages of an innovation project. In this course, you will learn about key concepts and methods of generating customer-centric business ideas and innovative concepts. After completing this course you will improve your career qualifications as Product Manager, Engineer, Process Manager and Marketing Manager. Learners from the industries of Product Management, Engineering, Innovation Management and Customer Relationship Management already completed the course as well as Consultants and Entrepreneurs. University of Michigan (2–4 hours to complete) We did an event on universal basic income in 2017, Silicon Valley, Universal Basic Income and the Future of Work, to explore how Silicon Valley was embracing basic income as a possible (if not temporary or limited) solution to the economic hardship that will likely arise from technological disruption like automation. Back then, hopes were high. Like so many other stories in emerging tech last year, this one came crashing back down to reality as cities around the world that had initially launched Basic Income pilot programs to test its potential, pulled their test program abruptly and early including Ontario and Finland. In an article early last year, the publication Motherboard, cried foul: Basic Income Is Being Set Up to Fail. But just because early trials are failing (for whatever reason) that doesn’t mean Basic Income is dead. Quite the contrary, like the emerging technologies experiencing a cold 2019, UBI is likely going through growth pains as societies globally try to figure out what economic model will work. This short course will offer a great overview and food for thought! Course Description: The United States social safety net is a complex system with many programs and often difficult eligibility requirements. Many of these programs only deliver in-kind aid (not cash) to people living in poverty, a lot of whom can fall through the cracks and can’t make ends meet. Basic income, the idea of providing people with a minimal level of cash support on a consistent basis, remains a point of debate in the United States and beyond. In this Teach-Out, you will join leading experts to explore the emerging idea of basic income and other associated social safety net programs. University of Lausanne (Switzerland) Course Description: This course teaches how narrow frames and strong contexts can push good people towards unethical decisions and how they can protect themselves and their organization against ethical blindness. The goal of this course is to empower the participants to analyze the risks of unethical or illegal behavior that might be triggered by powerful contexts. It draws from various disciplines such as management, psychology, sociology, philosophy, and literature, in order to learn what these disciplines contribute to a better understanding of unethical behavior. The course also analyzes some of the most prominent organizational scandals of the recent decades through the lenses of these disciplines. Wesleyan University So you want to change the world? This course is cut and dry — and plenty thought-provoking. Nothing is every as easy as it seems, least of all, changing the world. This is a good place to start. Course Description: How can we use the things we share in common to address some of the most challenging problems facing the world? This course examines issues concerning poverty, the environment, technology, health care, gender, education and activism to help us understand better how to initiate positive change. The University of New South Whales (starts January 2) The future will be defined by both technologists and storytellers (among others, of course). This course will provide an overview of storytelling across platforms using various technologies — including the challenges of working with new technologies (AR/VR/XR) to tell stories created for traditional media. Transmedia storytelling is the practice of designing, sharing, and participating in a cohesive story experience across multiple traditional and digital delivery platforms — for entertainment, advertising and marketing, or social change. How do the professionals develop such expansive narratives? How do they ensure that each element stays true to the original story? How do they innovatively use different technologies to share the stories, grow audiences and create an active and involved community of fans? More and more, we are also engaging with elements or franchises of larger and more complex stories across a much more diverse range of platforms like interactive web experiences, social media communities, mobile devices, theme parks, and even augmented and virtual reality. A major challenge that current and future storytellers face is being able to engage different audiences in a story that is seamlessly told across all of these different platforms. Università Bocconi (started December 24) Nations across the world are preparing to upgrade their old, dilapidated infrastructures to Smart Cities of the future and, as a result, will not only be preparing for emerging technologies and the challenges they will bring, but they are also looking for ways to fund major infrastructure upgrades. This course is a great primer for understanding where the money will come from to build Smart Cities. Course Description: Learn how debt and equity can be used to finance infrastructure investments and how investors approach infrastructure investments! According to the OECD, the global infrastructure investment requirement by 2030 for transport, electricity generation, transmission & distribution, and water & telecommunications totals to 71 trillion dollars. This figure represents about 3.5% of the annual World GDP from 2007 to 2030. Traditionally investments in infrastructure were financed using public sources. However, severe budget constraints and inefficient management of infrastructure by public entities have led to an increased involvement of private investors in the business. The course focuses on how private investors approach infrastructure projects from the standpoint of equity, debt, and hybrid instruments. Copenhagen Business School (starts January 21) Technologies like AI, machine learning and VR/AR have already begun to dramatically change how consumers shop and how brands deliver experiences to them. One of the biggest problems innovation and marketing teams face is understanding which technologies to implement to engage consumers, how to do it smartly, and what to with the data. This course will help anyone looking to answer these questions understand consumer behavior according to new neuroscience research. Course Description: How do we make decisions as consumers? What do we pay attention to, and how do our initial responses predict our final choices? To what extent are these processes unconscious and cannot be reflected in overt reports? This course will provide you with an introduction to some of the most basic methods in the emerging fields of consumer neuroscience and neuromarketing. You will learn about the methods employed and what they mean. You will learn about the basic brain mechanisms in consumer choice, and how to stay updated on these topics. The course will give an overview of the current and future uses of neuroscience in business. Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (starts January 2) Our event last year (The Last Mile: an $80 Billion Global Logistics Problem and the Blockchain Solution) which reviewed how startup Fr8 is using blockchain technology to change last-mile logistics and supply chain management for the better, offered great insights into this topic. With e-commerce giants like Amazon and Walmart in fierce competition to define and dominate supply chains in the future, and technologies like automation, autonomous vehicles and blockchain set to disrupt our entire global supply chain, this course is an ideal foundation for learning about supply chain management before delving into learning about how technology will disrupt them. Course Description: As a human being, we all consume products and/or services all the time. This morning you got up and ate your breakfast, e.g., eggs, milk, bread, fresh fruits, and the like. After the breakfast, you drove your car to work or school. At your office, you used your computer, perhaps equipped with 27” LCD monitor. During your break, you drank a cup of coffee and played with your iPhone. So on and so forth. You probably take it for granted that you can enjoy all of these products. But if you take a closer look at how each of these products can be made and eventually delivered to you, you will realize that each one of these is no short of miracle. In this course, we want to understand fundamental principles of value creation for the consumers or the market. We try to answer questions like how the product or service is made, how the value-creating activities or functions are coordinated, who should play what leadership roles in realizing all these, and so on. As our course title hints, we approach all of these issues from a learning perspective, which is dynamic in nature and emphasizes long-term capability building rather than short-term symptomatic problem solving. Delft University of Technology Electric cars aren’t just the future, they’re the present! If you’ve been wondering what all of the Tesla/electric battery hoopla is about, take this 4-week course. It offers a thorough overview of electric car space from the policy perspective (something that doesn’t get nearly as much coverage in the media and Elon Musk’s tweets). Course Description: Learn about the role of public policy in steering technological innovation and infrastructural change toward zero-emission mobility. Electric cars are more than a novel means of mobility. They have been recognized as an essential building block of the energy transition. Fulfilling their promise will imply a significant change in the technical, digital and social dimensions of transport and energy infrastructure. As the massive adoption of electric mobility will deeply change our society and our individual routines, government intervention is called for. If you are interested in learning about the roles of government in shaping the transition towards electric mobility and renewable energy systems, then this is the course for you. In this course, you will explore the promise of electric mobility from different public policy perspectives and different levels of government, and learn how they interact. After completing this course, you will be able to assess a policy plan to support the introduction of electric cars and make a motivated choice between alternative policy instruments. In the final week, the course will be concluded by connecting the different track perspectives. University of London International Programmes (starts January 21) With the launch of our Mission AI program last Summer, Tech 2025 has made a firm commitment to helping our members to learn about (and participate in) AI research. We believe strongly that, while not everyone will necessary want to (or needs to) learn how to develop AI and machine learning technologies to be part of developing it, everyone benefits (including the entire AI ecosystem) if the public is as least reasonably fluent in understanding how research is done, funded, and used. We’ve already hosted several events on this topic including, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Research and Preparing for Battle Against Malicious Artificial Intelligence. Both events were packed with people eager to learn the latest research. This course is a great introduction to research methods and the (academic) research ecosystem. Course Description: The course will appeal to those of you who require an understanding of research approaches and skills, and importantly an ability to deploy them in your studies or in your professional lives. In particular, this course will aid those of you who have to conduct research as part of your postgraduate studies but do not perhaps have access to research methods courses, or for those of you who feel you would like additional support for self-improvement. No prior knowledge or experience in research is required to take this course and as such, the course is for everyone. In 2015, the course was nominated for the prestigious Guardian University Award for its innovative approach to online learning. Purdue University (starts January 7) With Silicon Valley and tech companies facing increasing backlash for their lack of diversity and inclusion policies, and the demand for companies in general to be more inclusive and culturally sensitive, taking a course like this seems like a good bet regardless of your background. This is a discussion that will undoubtedly stay at the forefront of the tech and business industry in the coming years as they grapple with developing technologies that are inclusive and representative of the true fabric of society. Course Description: Learn how to create a more inclusive world. Many things contribute to an individual’s identity, including race, ethnicity, gender, age, appearance, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, education, and political beliefs. These things, and more, are what make each of us different. So how can we learn to embrace these differences, and celebrate them? Or to put it in a different way — how can we explore and welcome diversity? This course will help you develop your knowledge and understanding of diversity, equipping you to create more inclusive and open environments that are welcome to all. Topics covered include: Phases of diversity dexterity, Attitudes, skills, and knowledge supporting diversity, Unconscious biases, Ethnocentric and ethno-relative mindsets, Elements of diversity and inclusion.

For 2019, we’ll see an uptick in both emerging selling techniques and established technology that are must-haves for growing businesses. Here are 8 fast growing trends you should utilize asap! Mobile apps are here to stay and to continue their explosive growth. Each year we see a rise of mobile app usage. 2019 will be no different. Brands are using mobile apps to better serve customers with an undistracted shopping experience and a vehicle for sending personalized messages through push notifications. It seems to be well received. According to a report from Statista, by the year 2020, mobile apps are expected to generate $188.9 billion as global revenue. For e-commerce apps, in particular, consumers spend 8x more than on traditional selling channels. If your brand is considering a mobile app, now’s time to get on board. 1.

The Coming Disruption to E-Commerce Search The effectiveness of video marketing is not new. However, live video has been making waves in the world of e-commerce. The introduction of shoppable video has us prepared for a full-blown tsunami of popularity in the new year. Facebook Live, in particular, has given brands a new way to show brand personality, build true fan connection, and provide that coveted human connection. Facebook Live has given retailers a way to show up for a broad audience, increasing brand reach, engagement, and overall sales. How can you make your live video shoppable? Cue comment selling. Comment Selling is not new, but it is a young and budding trend. Brands have already seen the necessity and value of having a social media presence. However, they may not have seen the burgeoning opportunity of monetizing their social media following. Comment selling marries social media and e-commerce by allowing customers to purchase directly through comment claims on Facebook and Instagram. Comment selling possesses an undeniable appeal with its power to drive peer to peer marketing, cultivate brand loyalty, and attract new customers quickly and effortlessly. Businesses of all sizes can use comment selling to bolster sales and drive customer engagement. To make it really work for scaling businesses, it helps to implement tools that will automatically send invoices straight to your customer’s inbox or messenger as soon as a comment claim is made. Modern customers make purchasing decisions over multiple touchpoints — online, offline, via mobile and on social channels. Businesses using 4 or more digital channels will outperform those using single or dual channels by 300%. However, businesses need a way to connect all these channels to a single hub for easier management and better customer experiences. Basically, one tool to handle them all. According to a survey by Boston Retail Partners, 81% of retailers will deploy a unified commerce platform to support commerce through all channels by the end of 2020. Expect to see a rise in these platforms and strong unions between social media selling, webstores, mobile app, and brick & mortar in 2019. Brick-and-Click is a business model in which a has both a physical and online presence with blending of the two through a number of engaging personalized tools and services. This method also utilizes a single inventory so there can be a smooth transition between both brick & mortar and online channels without overselling. Automation has already started making profound impacts on the business world and we see no end to its rise in popularity. A study by Supply Management stated that by 2019, 72% of enterprises would be using automation to reduce costs, improve productivity, increase compliance, and shorten transaction times. Automation can manage a multitude of tasks such as invoicing, re-targeting ads, marketing emails, and much more on autopilot. Not only does this lend to labor cost savings, but it also gives rise to improvements in productivity and accuracy. With automation freeing up business owners, they can invest more of their time in business strategy or simply have the ability to get their nights and weekends back. Do it all with one, simple tool.

2019,Written by William Freedman," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in William Freedman Follow -- Listen Share Sue me for not making my 2019 predictions until after the start of the year. Proscribed by my ethnicity from ever running on time, I just finally got around to putting up my new calendar. Anyway, here’s Your Humble Correspondent’s forecast for the next 363 days in all things blockchain-adjacent. For the record, this isn’t the calendar I just hanged on my fridge. 1902 Justus van Lieberg Trade Card Calendar front. Source: David Berry. When other investments turn sour, crypto will taste sweeter and sweeter. You heard a lot about the stock market’s losing year, but it was really just a regression to the mean after 2017’s profit party. So I think the indices will track upward this year — slowly, measuredly upward. Stocks will be boring. Bonds might be more interesting, but that’s not a compliment. As yield curves flatten and perhaps invert, there’ll be a disincentive to fund long-term projects, which is economic kryptonite. Prediction: Money will flow into crypto as a hedge on the bigger money that flows into cash. Vocabulary will improve. Malta’s regulators distinguish between cryptocurrencies, security tokens and utility tokens. Other regulators will catch up. And the industry will then catch up to the regulators because what gets measured gets done. Everyone will be scrupulous to define what it is they’re trying to do with their ICO or STO. Regulation will move forward, but un-regulation will move forwarder. Sovereign governments would be committing malpractice if they didn’t monitor the crypto space for KYC, AML, ATF and (especially) tax evasion concerns. So exchanges like Coinbase, which scrupulously adhere to all these standards, will continue to thrive by being a safe haven for institutional investors and other solid citizens who want to be — or at least appear — completely aboveboard with their crypto transactions. But let’s remember that “crypto” means “hidden,” and it was the whole Austrian-school, libertarian, borderline anarchical sentiment that fueled its adoption. Some people will still want to buy heroin straight from the poppy farmer. Others will want to transfer money to family in countries that don’t play nice with others. And still others will say it’s none of anyone’s goddamn business what I do with my money — it’s my money. For them, decentralized exchanges which offer enhanced privacy at the risk of running afoul of regulators will grow vigorously in offshore havens. Those who want to demonstrate compliance will, but those who don’t won’t. Putting paid to credit cards. Visa, MasterCard and American Express aren’t going anywhere, but they’re in for some competition via blockchain. Decentralized credit will emerge as a major use case for the technology. This will lower the cost per transaction at just the time when Lightning Network improves bandwidth enough to handle all the processing required. Credit card issuers won’t be measurably hurt by blockchain workarounds in the short term, but they will have to respond somehow. Money will relocate. It’s getting harder to make a living in financial services in London or Zurich. This isn’t just a cryptocurrency issue, although British and Swiss regulatory missteps and political ill will have been revealed in this space more starkly than elsewhere. Such digital asset-friendly venues as Malta, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates are likely to benefit from Old Money enclaves’ inability to keep up. Technology remains unpredictable. So I won’t attempt to predict it. What I’m confident in, though, is this: Blockchain will converge with gaming, machine learning and virtual/augmented reality to provide offerings by the end of the year that are unforeseeable at the beginning; meanwhile, the energy requirements of mining will spur improvements in efficiency and renewable sourcing. China has been sandbagging all this time, and that’s about to end. China will finally put an end to the charade that it has any reservations about crypto. Beijing would’ve ideally liked to keep the game going for a while longer, but the trade war — which it’s losing (I’m no Trump partisan, but a fact’s a fact) — is forcing its hand. By the end of the year, China will have legal centralized exchanges, tolerated offshore exchanges, more DLT patents than any other country, blockchain integrated into its currently sketchy and inefficient debt market, crypto pay options on all its leading e-commerce sites and maybe-just-maybe its own central bank digital currency (possibly developed by GXChain). Feel free to have a laugh at all this a year from now, but be sure to give me a couple days’ grace time. -- -- Hard-working, fact-based journalist on the FinTech beat Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*83pWieAdOHsZ5Y28.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/0*Iu7x2aRDbNAxfQOF.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/0*83pWieAdOHsZ5Y28.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*66dcEhjDf_D6O0jKsfPSQw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*83pWieAdOHsZ5Y28.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*tMNPxXgs8sZc1nincHkTkQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*83pWieAdOHsZ5Y28.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*gWYiqPQA41cKmxjd.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*83pWieAdOHsZ5Y28.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*7fVRot-wAeIZ7FVNA5olKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*83pWieAdOHsZ5Y28.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*nChshyHhYer985FIUWu6TA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*maC8NLpto3tNwluhoRODsw.png']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@WilliamFreedman?source=post_page-----67959c1cb740--------------------------------,4,4 min read

A Brief History On The Evolution of E-Commerce,Written by Pozess," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Pozess Follow -- Listen Share The ‘90s-early ’00s In August 1994, 21-year-old entrepreneur and creator of NetMarket, Dan Kohn, sold a CD to a friend who lived hundreds of miles away. This was a revolutionary moment in the history of ecommerce, as it came to be known as the first purchase made over the internet and the first purchase to be protected by encrypted technology. That same year, a 30 year old Jeff Bezos quit his Wall Street job in hopes of starting an internet company, and Amazon.com was created. The company grew quickly, and in 1999, Time Magazine named Jeff Bezos “Person of the Year” for popularizing online shopping. Almost 25 years later, Amazon is the biggest online retailer in the US. In 1995, Pierre Omidyar founded the P2P retail site, ebay.com. The “auction”-style business model changed the way people shop at the turn of the century by allowing people to bid on items that spoke to them. In 2003, Apple introduced the iTunes store and by 2004, iTunes had sold 100 million songs. iTunes was revolutionary in that it aided in the acceptance and expansion of social sharing — people could now easily share and suggest their favorite music to friends over the internet. Why The Online Migration? According to the US Census Bureau, as of 2016, 89% of US households have a computer in the home (up from 36.6% in 1997). In fast paced societies such as our own, the internet provides a convenience factor — whether that’s to research prices, or to purchase an item straight from a website with the click of a button. For consumers, there are also endless possibilities when shopping online — the internet knows no boundaries. Pozess and the Future of Ecommerce Pozess promises to continue the online shopping evolution. The blockchain-powered platform empowers the consumer to control the marketplace by sharing their favorite brands with the community while discovering and shopping new products they never knew existed. Social sharing plus the feeling of discovery make shopping fun and interactive, and put virtually unlimited choices of luxury fashion and lifestyle products in the hands of the consumer.

Water Challenges Have Created Extraordinary Opportunities,Written by Greg Johnson," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Greg Johnson Follow -- Listen Share Quiet as kept, we are facing a water crisis in the U.S. that’s being inflamed by a serious innovation deficit in water infrastructure. It can be solved, but only through the intersection of new technologies and fresh approaches with status-quo establishments in the water sector. Easier said than done, but what a huge opportunity. All things considered, urban water management sits low on the “environmental urgency” totem pole. A dangerous combination of institutional risk-aversion, paltry investment in new technology, and artificially low water prices factor into this lethargy. Meanwhile, urbanization, the decay of century old infrastructure, and unpredictable weather patterns are straining urban water systems to the brink of failure. The Key to Climate Resiliency: Innovation It used to be that we could rely on past data to determine groundwater supplies or the potential for flooding in a given area. Those days are long gone. A changing climate is a present reality that has everything to do with our future water security. In 2017, extreme weather cost the U.S. $300 billion. New scientific research shows that ten times more Americans are at risk of being flooded out by rivers within the next 20 years, even if greenhouse emissions are completely and immediately curbed. If water security comes down to how cities address this new normal, old path-dependent approaches will prove disastrous. Knowing that current water infrastructure in the U.S. is nearing the end of its useful life, utilities are hurtling toward $700 Billion in new spending on water projects. This is an unprecedented opportunity for new approaches to be adopted by the industry. Fortunately, paradigm-shifting technologies are being (and have been) developed in each cog of the urban water cycle. Bold new material technologies in permeable paving for stormwater infrastructure, distributed water technologies, potable water reuse, and energy recovery from wastewater all show tremendous promise. These could be game-changers at scale, improving the physical structure and financial future for urban water systems…If given the chance. Financing the Future of Water: Institutional path-dependence is but one barrier for promising technologies. The other obvious barrier is the lack of private investment in the development and deployment these technologies. In a vicious circle, the industry that most needs new technologies repels the industry that invests in new technologies — venture capital. Herd mentality on top of herd mentality. Normally, promising startups turn to venture capital to finance growth. But in a dislocated (albeit, huge) industry with slow sales cycles and regulatory sluggishness, it turns out that venture capital is inherently at odds with water startups. Ironically, this probably bodes well for startups in the space. While institutional investors play follow the leader and pile into more marketable environmental plays, innovative water technologies will be backed by new financing mechanisms that allow them to be developed, launched, and deployed in ways that can be truly impactful. It is my feeling that we are entering a truly disruptive period in water infrastructure. Regulatory policy-making is getting lapped by technological advances and new startup financing mechanisms like equity crowdfunding are finding their footing. The truth is, real innovation finds its way around entrance barriers. And when outdated institutional factors influence decision making — even when a new technology demonstrates the massive potential to improve an existing issue — disruption looms. Recall, we all used to hail taxi cabs. -- -- Founder & CEO, AquiPor Technologies. “What stands in the way becomes the way.” Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*yFQ1vqNtua_WsMLpBF0nJw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*cgssF53BZ8JfzbM7HYS8bA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*cgssF53BZ8JfzbM7HYS8bA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*lqL-vBBz5vVlqkq9', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*cgssF53BZ8JfzbM7HYS8bA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*Um_i3ZkpMPLbT7rU', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*cgssF53BZ8JfzbM7HYS8bA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*MPka5uOW0D_gJMIh', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*cgssF53BZ8JfzbM7HYS8bA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*yuVzMhCJyDENbyhwAsrkwA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*cgssF53BZ8JfzbM7HYS8bA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*nChshyHhYer985FIUWu6TA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*maC8NLpto3tNwluhoRODsw.png']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@g_g_johnson?source=post_page-----4a28bdaf014a--------------------------------,0,3 min read
A few happy science moments from 2018,Written by nanomolar," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in nanomolar Follow -- Listen Share As we welcome in 2019, we leave behind a year that has come with exceptional scientific breakthroughs that will leave a smile on our face well into this New Year. Although the battle against Alzheimer still has a long way to go, with no effective cures on the market and no promising results yet for drugs designed to slow down the onset of the disease, researchers can at least now hope to detect the disease decades before its onset. Dr. Randall Bateman´s team at Washington University School of Medicine is developing a quick inexpensive amyloid beta blood test that can identify patients long before they start developing the symptoms. Identifying and treating patients sooner might help develop preventative measures. Another breakthrough test, developed at the University of Queensland, is a universal cancer test that can detect traces of any cancer in a blood sample in 10 minutes. The test is based on the discovery that cancer DNA sticks to metal surfaces in a different way to healthy DNA, which is much more heavily methylated. This translates into a colorimetric test in which gold nanoparticles interacting with the patient´s DNA will allow the detection of cancer DNA. Unfortunately 2018 has also opened our eyes about the great problem the planet faces due to pollution with plastic. On the brighter side, many talented researchers are racing against the clock to solve the issue. And as an example, a new enzyme is being developed to break down PET, which could allow plastic bottles to be fully recycled back into new bottles, limiting the need to produce new plastic. It will be exciting to see 2019 unfold and reveal new technologies and scientific breakthroughs that may hold the key to solving some of our society´s biggest problems.

Why is it that Rolls-Royce cars are expensive?,Written by Yeshu David," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Yeshu David Follow -- Listen Share I was deeply overwhelmed by the appreciation through Upvotes on Quora, that I couldn’t resist myself from sharing you the insights about this marvel of engineering & masterpiece. The Short Answer to the expensiveness of Rolls is : Because nearly every task is completed by hand. The Long Answer : Inside the car, the leather is had from Scandinavian bulls only. (Rolls Royce gets leathers from only those bulls that have been already killed for food.) The cars space frame chassis is first built in Germany and then shifted to Goodwood plant (England). Inside the paint expanse, it requires 22 steps, 5 layers of paint and seven days before the body is perfect and in total 45 kilograms of paint is sprayed onto the body shell. This takes almost a week to 10 days because even the paint works are mostly done by hands & the last layer of paint is done by a couple of robots. The process of polishing takes 5 hours. A special tradition is used named “Bookmatching”, where the veneers are given a glossy finish to give the mirror look from each side. 450 pieces of leather and 17 days are necessary for completing the interior. The star looking roof needs one of the best and skillful workers, who take about 12 hours to build one roof. The car’s interior consists of 42 different parts of veneers totally handcrafted. The veneers are sourced from all over the world and many different kinds of wood are available. Each car takes weeks at least to create. The fastest car that Rolls can make is the Ghost, which takes a minimum of 30 days and 60 hands to make. The Phantom takes a minimum of 45 days. Some Rolls-Royce’s can even take up to a year.

It also outlines just how far the technology has gone since its conception with the help of simple graphs. Its continuous ascent is equally depicted, which readily gives the impression of just how efficient IoT is. What exactly does it do and how is it related to smart technology? These questions would also be answered with the help of illustrations and enumerations of the factors that allow IoT to influence important aspects such as security and blockchain technology. The infographic may be short but you can rest assured that it’s packed with practically everything you need to know. If you want a great way to familiarize yourself with IoTwithout having to invest too much time, look no further than the resource you can use below. -- -- Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:88:88/0*viSvKy6akatBZbiT', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*tJhA7IhubH7GhR1v1MSEqg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:144:144/0*viSvKy6akatBZbiT', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*TQlEMeYwwWc38Wqm7EfCTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*0-N4JrXpZG1KJfIrAutd3A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/0*r4yjMpEmqzHCUvWC.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*bv2KUVNLi2sFNjBTdoBmWw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/0*zsngbTOmFCy6sUCx.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*mfZP8TZsoNwTSF9YJMAQlQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*4nt7sX_aOh-v_QhRv8AjhA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*N420g7N3DOSD24_XkPJUxw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@sharmila.kamaraj7?source=post_page-----93301da670eb--------------------------------,115,2 min read
My Simple Approach to Testing,Written by itsnathandaily," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in itsnathandaily Follow -- Listen Share Start with the APIs I try to understand how each exposed API works and how it connects to the backend. I see it as a big black box unit that accepts inputs and sends back responses. Questions I ask myself are: What are the APIs and how do they get called? Is it possible to emulate the entire platform from the API layer, using a tool like Postman or even in Java. Write behavioral, positive and negative API tests in postman. I try to get as much coverage as possible. Finally, I automate the API tests. The User Interface I design the UI tests from the acceptance criteria and collaborate with the developers ahead of time. In the tests, I include negative, boundary and edge cases. In addition to the designed tests, I manually test the UI in exploratory style (mostly to discover edge cases). I add any test case I find to the set of test cases already drafted. I ensure the entire UI test cases are automated. Stubbing and mocking When testing a particular UI feature, I try to stub out the back end (To be more succinct, I stub out the API that is called from the UI). I do this to strictly focus on functionality. For the web and app UIs, I use Apimocker to create localhost server to which I would conveniently programme to give me the desired response that I want and I would use Charles Proxy’s remapping tool to redirect the API call and return the response that the UI needs. Automated Tests When writing automated tests- I design them to be configurable. Especially when it comes to the following Making the automated tests configurable can be cumbersome to set up, but it goes a long way. People looking to add to or understand the test code always appreciate this. Testing Performance and Stress I like to operate performance and stress tests from the API layer rather than from the UI. I use JMeter but there are so many other tools that can be used to do this. Key performance indicators I use are the following Find me at @itsnathandaily and www.nathandaily.com -- -- Software Engineer.

"You Are Technical, And So Is Everyone Else",Written by DCG 201," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in DCG 201 Follow -- Listen Share You Are Technical, And So Is Everyone Else Part of why we founded DEFcon 201 is to combat misplaced notions surrounding Technology and a person being “Technical”. Every now and again, I will meet someone who describes themselves as a non-technical person. This is in fact not true. All people are in fact technical. Everything from flipping a lightswitch to driving a car is in fact a technical operation. Most people use cellphones, computers, the internet, automobiles. Even those that do not, used previous generations of machines like typewriters, faxes, phones, and bicycles. These are all machines with histories. Engineered constructions. Its always been like this. The very concept of civilization is a society and social evolution around machines and engineering. All known human societies are in fact known to use construct and use tools. It is noted by the peoeple who study as such as a common defining element of humanity. To us there is nothing greater to be more in touch with the human spirit than to understand and have agency of the tools we use, and define our lives. Be it computers and phones, or even automobiles, trains, and radios. Some people have noted that others do in fact seek and master a greater understanding of the engineering in their surroundings than others. There is a misplaced shroud of secrecy and mythos surrounding these seekers and the machines they operate. It is the mission of our group invite the public to gain a better understanding and knowledge of the machines already in their lives that they use and depend on. For gaining knowledge and capaiblities in such system is to give agency, we aruge that it be the right of all peoples and persons to be able to understand such technology around them, as well as pursue technology to enrich and better their own lives. We, at DC201 urge you to be more technical, to get in touch with the machines around you, you depend on, and with it.

Four Lessons from 2018,"Written by Daniel,Make a (mental) list of people who’s opinions and views of you actually matter to you.,Your phone should be an aide, not a distraction.,Start reducing clutter.,Remove toxicity from your life or pay the price."," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Daniel Follow -- Listen Share A quick one. 2019 or bust. The next time you receive a random dirty look from a stranger on the street, or someone says your clothes look weird, look at/think about the list. Not on the list? Don’t care. This is from an article I can’t find but do remember really well. If anyone recognises it please hit me up with a source so I can credit the original author. We’ve all probably heard in some way form or another that Social Media is ruining our mental health, and too often we need to be “available” for people and we need to “reply in good time”. When focusing on a task or something at work this past year, it seemed easier than ever for me to switch off and get distracted and open up Facebook or Reddit for a quick browse. If a message pops up on Android as a heads-up notification it’s immediately there, and in your face. I’ve started swiping them up or away as they are just so intrusive. I guess now it’s time to just turn them off for good. If you want you can go to the extreme and just place your phone on silent for good, with perhaps the option of including exceptions for calls from the most important people in your life. Phones are amazing devices but the way that they operate as well as all social media distraction sinkholes is to get and then keep your attention. That’s why I’ve removed suggested videos from YouTube and muted most notifications on the few social apps installed. I’ve killed the Facebook news feed from pretty much every device I own and resorted to using Chrome on my phone if I want to see what’s on there. Every time I do check it I ask myself why I did as the memes and news articles are novel for about a minute and I close the tab. And I’m slowly warming to the idea of deleting Facebook itself by the end of the year. Something we can all start to think about, which is essentially the essence of minimalism — you probably own a lot of old stuff in boxes or cupboards that you don’t actually need.Is this souvenir improving your life in any way? Is this cool packaging box for this tablet really needed in your life? Throw them out.Do you wear these old clothes anymore? Wow, phyiscal copies of computer games you last played 7 years ago? Are you ever going to read this book you got as a gift? Donate them to charity. Maybe recycle the clothes. Because we all know you’re probably just buying more and more stuff each day anyway, and your room is probably not as tidy or organised as it could be. Most people can be reasoned with. I would always suggest a sensible dialouge where people try to understand disagreements and maybe find a common ground. Some people can’t, and once you’ve hit a certain point where no progress is being made, where the other party refuses to listen or care, move on. It is no longer worth exerting any effort or thought — it’s not about giving up, it’s about choosing your battles and doing it wisely. Have a great new year everyone. Goodbye 2018. -- -- I was elected to read, not to lead. It seems however that I am more open to the idea of sharing my thoughts and ideas with the world, just gradually.

How Blockchain makes our life easier ?,Written by EurocoinPay.io," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in EurocoinPay.io Follow -- Listen Share The path since the appearance of Bitcoin Blockchain, it’s been a long way since the Bitcoin developed and counterparts appear to capture the attention of the global masses and financial industry. Blockchain guarantees traceability If we look at the distribution chain as we know it, it has multiple actors and steps involved that are almost always at very distant points. It is necessary to carry out multiple procedures and formalities of all kinds (departures, transports, imports, traceability, deliveries, invoicing, etc.) which for their guarantee require adequate follow-up. For the most part, companies and organisations do not offer transparency in this sense and even manipulate it. Blockchain is presented as the real solution for the digitalization of the supply chain. Traceability is synonymous with knowing the origin of a product and being able to follow its course in the different steps of the transformation and distribution chain, without being manipulated. With Blockchain it´s programmable, reliable and allows to obtain information in real time with operations carried out . What for? In order to be able to act as quickly as possible in the event of an incident. These characteristics turn it as a guarantee of quality for the companies, especially in the food industry. We have seen it in the campaign for a large supermarket in Spain. The inviolability of Blockchain gives a much more convincing value. With the adoption of Blockchain, the stakeholders in the chain cannot alter it, since it is insured and jointly owned by several entities. In fact, contains information is more than reliable and cannot be questioned as it isn’t managed by a single actor that may have economic or political interests. It allows interested parties to gain operational efficiency, and above all to gain brand image in the eyes of consumers. Blockchain and the Cryptocurrencies When we talk about Bitcoin or Cryptocurrencies, we have to say that they are means of exchange like any other currency, the natural evolution of Fiat money to cryptocurrency, but the great difference is that the cryptocurrencies does not depend on any Central Bank or Government that controls their issuance. They have a value in traditional currencies: can be exchanged for dollars, euros or any other currency at any time, what’s more, you are able to to trade with cryptocurrencies and make the conversion to Fiat money and vice versa. The participants can use it across the multiple platforms, globally. The incorporation of Bitcoin as a means of payment An alternative that is increasingly present in the street as a means of payment is that among the reasons why the popularity of the Cryptocurrency has increased considerably. First of all its safety, economical, decentralize and without intermediaries. Eurocoinpay, is a platform that is working to integrate traditional financial systems, which are currently in need of disruptive solutions such as Blockchain, and find niche market, seeking trust in society and government institutions and create value synergies for both in a friendlier world. State of the market for Cryptocurrency We could talk about euphoria if we had joined the cryptocurrency market a few years ago, with an investment of one hundred euros invested in Bitcoin, at that time. Today we would have in our portfolio more than five million euros. On the contrary, those who did so in the end of 2017 are in a panic situation with significant losses after the market has made a major adjustment. The current moment is good. Now the market is developed and demanded, projects that are behind the crypto models bring significant value to society, investors have a lot of information available on each project and we must ensure that projects are real and not speculative. But be careful, in this sector there is a lot of intruder taking advantage of the little knowledge that the investors have in search of the high economic returns that there were in previous years, existing a high percentage of fraud. Is simple to join to world of cryptocurrencies, it only takes a few clicks and does not require great knowledge of economics, but the rationality and pragmatism. Many people have found in this sector a way to make small monthly contributions, with micro-investments in the medium and long term, but not investing, or putting at risk more than what we are willing to lose at a given time and above all that is does not gravely affect our economy. -- -- The application developed under the ERC20 + Tangle technology!!!

Graphene prosthetics and the cyberpunk future,Written by Don Basile," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Don Basile Follow -- Listen Share Within science fiction, particularly the subgenre known as cyberpunk, humans augment themselves with various technological devices and prosthetics to enhance themselves beyond human capabilities, or to repair themselves in ways that perfectly replicate body functions. So how do modern prosthetics fare compared to the technological marvels of fiction? While we have made huge leaps forward in bionics and myoelectrics, we are not quite yet at the level of the cyberpunk future. But with graphene, we may just be able to get there. The material’s strength, light weight, and endless utility could lead to even more dramatic advancements in prosthetic technology. In modern prosthetics, bionic limbs have done excellently in replicating movement and function of missing body parts for amputees, offering mostly full range of motion for legs, feet, arms, and hands. This can be contributed to the development of myoelectric sensors, which connect the artificial limb to the natural electrical processes generated by muscles in order to enable complex movement. Hand prosthetics in particular have made major advancements in replicating the intricate and specific motor functions of fingers. Our advancements in prosthetics make it so that we can successfully regain lost function, but still lack meaningful tactile perception. While some might argue that the absence of pain is a benefit, the use of touch to perceive potentially harmful stimuli to the host would be a valuable addition to the features prosthetics provide, not to mention the emotional and psychological relief that may come with such upgrades to prosthetic tech. This is where graphene can step in. Scientists have begun to use the wonder material to create a graphene-based skin for prosthetics. This e-dermis electrically stimulates the amputee’s nerves non-invasively through the skin, replicating the process of signal relaying that the brain utilizes in tactile feeling. In addition, graphene’s optical transparency allows for 98% of light to pass through it, making the perfect material to utilize solar energy to power these advanced prosthetics. Of course, pain is not the only feeling that this graphene skin would allow users to process, and it’s potential to make the feeling from phantom limbs a reality again is truly wondrous to behold. Even more intricate, graphene can potentially be used to create small implants and internal prostheses that would be capable of correcting eyesight or hearing, to repair the body and help in overcoming degenerative diseases, or even help mend broken bones. Previously, silicon-based implants were too damaging to internal tissues if disturbed, and the conditions inside the body damaged the electronic components. However, graphene’s strength, being 200 times stronger than steel, and its flexibility make it much more durable. It is also possible to use graphene to create transistors that are gated by the natural fluids surrounding the implant. With graphene, the hyper-advanced technological developments of cyberpunk are closer than ever. With graphene, prosthetics are on the cusp of reaching the technological heights of science fiction.

And the time was never so right and ripe to make that business move. EA takes a 360 degree enterprise-wide assessment through its 4 dimensions - Enterprise Architecture Framework can be thought of as a tool which comprises of a set of building blocks, and how each building block fit together to make a complete system. It gives guidance on concepts, models, techniques and methodologies. In other terms, it is a library which contains all of “WHAT” and none of “HOW”. Doing the enterprise architecture from scratch can be an intimidating job. The EA frameworks are designed and created to simplify this process and offer good help on best practices, standards, tools, processes, and templates for all areas of enterprise architecture development. Some executive level key deliverables of EA Frameworks are – The common complaint and a concern is the tedious and lengthy documentation that follows in practice of EA Frameworks. From the myriad of available EA frameworks — The top four frameworks which are well accepted, adopted by industry experts and architects community.

Brandon Simons and the origins of crypto,Written by LendoChain," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in LendoChain Follow -- Listen Share Brandon Simons, technical director at Verge (XVG) has “released a tell-all account about the origin of the cryptocurrency and his involvement with the early development and marketing efforts,” according to CCN. Simons, who is known as CryptoRekt on social media, revealed that his interest in cryptocurrency “first began in October 2009 when he discovered bitcoin,” and that he mined it for the next two years. In his Medium post he also discusses the fact that he experienced a hard disk crash in 2011, when he lost thousands of bitcoin and that afterwards he became a regular contributor to Reddit’s r/Cryptocurrency forum. This was a support group for people who had gone through a similar experience. CCN reports: “The loss he said, was where the nickname ‘CryptoRekt’ came from. It was in the course of this that he became involved with a privacy coin project known as DogeCoinDark (DOGED), which would later rebrand as Verge (XVG).” Simons recounts how DOGED started with a small team of 120 users in an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) room, and that it grew its vision of “enabling private peer-to-peer transactions, eventually rebranding itself as Verge in an attempt to gain more widespread appeal.” The marketing efforts included ‘shilling’ on social media and getting mentions on radio Crypto, which was at the time one of the most important media outlets for crypto stories. Verge remained relatively obscure within the crypto space until the release of the project’s whitepaper tagged ‘BlackPaper’ in June 2017. Simons followed this with putting together a global team to support Verge on a pro-bono basis, and according to Simons this Verge Core Marketing team has around 40 members. Explaining the importance Verge has to him on a personal level Simons said: Verge is truly something special, it is decentralized, it has a wonderful community around the world, and it has a team of passionate individuals who just want to see it succeed — all the required ingredients for a successful project. What does Verge mean to me? Freedom. Verge to me is the freedom to help create & shape something that can truly provide a means for people to be able to retain a bit of their personal lives and not have to worry about sacrificing a basic human right; privacy, any time they want to transact for goods & services. -- -- A Smart Marketplace that changes everything for #BNBChainNFTs.

Playtech to pay $32m additional tax to Israeli authorities,"No penalties are to be imposed as a result of the audit and the agreement will cover the entirety of the Playtech group’s activity in Israel.,Written by The Jerusalem Post"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in The Jerusalem Post Follow Jerusalem Post -- Listen Share BY EYTAN HALON Gambling software firm Playtech will pay approximately $32 million in additional tax to Israeli authorities following a civil tax audit covering a decade of activity, the company said on Wednesday. Founded in 1999 by Israeli-Cypriot multi-billionaire businessman Teddy Sagi, Playtech is a leading gambling hi-tech company developing intelligence-driven gambling software, services, content and platform technology for a range of casinos and sports betting products. The company, listed on the London Stock Exchange, issued a statement stating that it reached an agreement on December 31, 2018, to pay additional taxes worth approximately $32 million covering the fiscal years 2008 to 2017 inclusively after Israeli tax authorities “made transfer pricing adjustments in relation to certain functions performed by the Playtech group in Israel during this period.” No penalties are to be imposed as a result of the audit and the agreement will cover the entirety of the Playtech group’s activity in Israel. Payment is expected to be made in the next 30 days. In December, the company announced that Italian legislation to increase taxation on various types of gambling is expected to reduce its 2019 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization by approximately $23–28.5 million. Playtech currently employs 5,800 employees across 17 countries including Israel, and is headquartered in the Isle of Man.

5 Biggest Challenges of IoT,Written by eForte.net," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in eForte.net Follow -- Listen Share By the year 2020, the market size for the Internet of Things (IoT for short) will reach an approximate €242,222 million. Although relatively new, the field of IoT has risen dramatically during the years. But everything has its risks and security concerns especially when it comes to the field of technology. Since IoT has not yet penetrated the mainstream market, there is intense competition among the manufacturers on getting their products and devices to the consumers first. This often results in overlooking the potential security issues that can arise regarding data access and management as well as the IoT devices themselves. Below is a list of some major security concerns associated with IoT Insufficient testing and updating: As of 2018, it has been estimated that the number of IoT devices connected in connected and smart homes is 17 billion and will rise up to 20 billion by 2020. This influx of latest gadgets and devices also means that tech companies aren’t putting as much thought into the device security risks as they should have. Often many of these devices and IoT products do not get enough updates. Some of them don’t even have any updates. This results in devices that were once considered secure as the time of purchase by the customers often become less protected and may even become vulnerable to hackers and other security issues. The early computer systems suffered from this very problem. The lack of updates caused them to become prone to security risks where initially they weren’t. These issues were resolved with the automatic updates. Unfortunately, IoT manufacturers are more focused on launching and delivering their products as fast as they can, giving little thought to security. Even if manufacturers do release their firmware updates, they tend to do so only for a brief period of time which lasts the moment they start working on their next big gadget. And to make matters worse, they use unsupported legacy Linux kernels. Source: Google Images Ultimately all this results in their customers being prone to potential security attacks because of outdated hardware and software both. In order to fully secure yourself from such attacks, the manufacturers need to implement a proper testing and quality assurance system before launching their devices to the public. Furthermore, companies should remain careful in updating them regularly. The importance of updates should never be underestimated the entire reputation of the company can be at stake. It only requires one single large scale breach of data to make the customers lose their faith in the company and bring down its image. IoT malware and ransomware: Because of the expected rise in IoT devices, it is not unfair to expect the rise of IoT malwares and ransomwares too. The traditional malwares were reliant on encryption to completely lock the users out from their devices. Now with the advent of hybridization of malwares and ransomwares, their attacks can be a lot more varied now with potentially devastating effects. For instance, a simple Internet Protocol (IP) camera can be easily accessed to capture confidential information using several locations like your home or your office. The webcam can then be locked from its user while all its data is transferred to a web address designed to browse and extract sensitive data by using the malware’s access point. Once this has been done, ransom is then demanded from the original user for unlocking the device and returning the data. While this is a textbook example of malwares and ransomwares, the rapidly growing field of IoT also enables an entire field of attacks on these devices. Source: Google Images IoT Botnets and cryptocurrency: Unless if you have been living under a rock, you would probably be aware of cryptocurrency, even if not in too much detail. The intense mining competition and the rise in cryptocurrency is a highly tempting opportunity for hackers. Although blockchain technology was designed to prevent hacking and modification of data, there is still a steady increase in the number of attacks in several blockchain sectors. The targeted area isn’t the blockchain itself, it’s the app development which is running blockchain. There are several methods already underway to extract sensitive information, one of which is social engineering. Through this method, confidential information like usernames, passwords, private keys are being hacked. Cryptocurrencies are also being mined with IoT devices. Monero is an example of the many open source cryptocurrency that can be mined from these devices. There have been several cases of hackers having repurposed IP and video cameras for mining cryptocurrencies. IoT devices and applications need to be constantly updated and regulated if we are to counter the threat of these exploitation methods. The field of cryptocurrency is already quite unpredictable and data manipulation can result in flooding the crypto-market and cause havoc. Brute forcing and default passwords: One of the most prominent cases of brute forcing was the Mirai malware which was used in some of the largest DDoS attacks to the devices that were shipped with default passwords. The customers were not instructed to change the default usernames and passwords when they were received. While there are indeed some governmental reports that advise companies against selling IoT devices with default usernames and passwords like “admin”, these reports are simply considered mere guidelines for which there isn’t any legal action. Nor are there any incentives for companies to forgo this practice. These weak credentials make all the IoT devices prone to password hacking, especially the brute force method. Source: Google Images Privacy and security: Today’s world of inter-connectivity with practically everyone has both facilitated the communication process and has also created a whole range of security threats. Data is in a constant flux of being stored and processed every second by companies and businesses of every type on multiple platforms including IoT devices like smart TVs, HVAC systems, smart thermostats, connected printers, speakers and lighting systems and many more. Unfortunately it is a fact that most of our data is shared or sold between companies which is quite clearly a breach of privacy and is a criminal act. Not only does it allow unauthorized access to our personal info but it also destroys a company’s image and the trust it had built with its customers. To ensure that sensitive information is not being distributed, there should be a stricter implementation of the privacy policies. Another way is to redact and anonymize sensitive data prior to storing it on IoT devices which may be used to identify the individual owning them. Similar practices can be applied for mobile applications, services and other electronic devices which store and utilize data in some form or another. It is recommended for a company that handles sensitive information to go through a directory of mobile and web application development companies that can help you in ensuring data security and can prevent breaches and attacks. These cyber security companies, provided that you opt for a good, reliable one, can go a long way to protect your data. Although IoT devices have yet to reach their full penetration of the mass market, their development is making progress by leaps and bounds. It won’t be long that IoT becomes a household term just like today’s smartphones are.

“Flat Organization just works” — How Punchkick’s method helps it flourish,Written by Scott Kitun," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Scott Kitun Follow -- Listen Share “It’s crazy. It just works,” says Zak Dabbas of the “flat” organizational structure behind his digital marketing agency, Punchkick Interactive. “Flat just means that everybody has the same opportunity to grow.” For Zak, flat isn’t just a buzzword. It’s a reflection of his personal journey. Zak was pre-med in college, intending to follow in his father’s footsteps and become a physician. But life had other plans. “My last year, I got testicular cancer. I went through chemo, all of it,” he says. It was a nightmare. I had this moment where I was like, I don’t want to be in hospitals for the rest of my life. That’s not my passion.” So Zak did what he thought was the next best thing: law school. While getting his JD, Zak and his now-business-partner began building digital projects on the side, for “weekend money,” he says. Soon, he realized that his side hustle was what really lit him up. “I thought, this is the only thing I like,” Zak says. “The only thing I’m excited about is the digital work we do.” “So in the middle of law school, we got a website up, got some spec projects on it, and I started firing off new business emails. By the time I graduated, we had landed two Fortune-level clients. I walked into the law firm where I was working at the time and said, ‘smell you later. I’m outta here.’ And I never looked back.” Zak’s roundabout path to creative agency CEO has given him a unique perspective on leadership. “Because I had been beaten and battered by all these other industries I was in previously — especially in law — when I started Punchkick, I wanted it to be a safe place,” he says. “The philosophy behind it was always flat. I hired people that I really liked, respected, and admired, who I would want to work with. Because, I have one life to live. I’m going to enjoy this.” Zak sees the culture of Punchkick as its key differentiator in the vast digital marketing landscape. The team of about 40 is run without managers or other traditional hierarchical roles. New employees choose their own title, based on their skill set and experience. Company financials and client health project statuses are completely transparent. Daily morning huddles create a close-knit atmosphere. An agile workflow keeps things humming along. “This company has grown to become almost like a group of mini-CEOs,” Zak says. “It’s unbelievable — the initiatives that happen internally and organically. What our clients hopefully find is that the team is so dedicated and intelligent. It’s really nice to have a company where everybody can deliver so much value.” Zak credits Frederic Laloux’s groundbreaking book “Reinventing Organizations,” which applies concepts of mindfulness and human evolution to model a more “soulful” workplace. “It’s the only book I’ll ever plug,” says Zak. “I don’t really ever read business books, but it’s great.” Flat organization isn’t the only thing that sets Punchkick apart. The agency stands out with a user-oriented approach. “The processes we have are really solid. We’ve been around. We know what we’re doing. But we’re not trusting of ourselves. We trust the audience. So we don’t build projects or products without actually doing user research and testing, and really hearing that it’s a winning product.” To date, Punchkick’s clients include Harley-Davidson, Walmart, Microsoft, Allstate, and Intuit. One of Zak’s favorite projects is their design and development of Marriott’s flagship e-commerce app. Making humongous clients like Marriott ecstatic takes top-notch talent, Zak says. Clearly he’s able to attract it because of the culture he’s created at Punchkick. I have conversations with companies looking for tech talent all day, every day. Take note: if you don’t follow Zak’s lead and foster an environment where people get to work together as a unit, you’re going to have a very hard time hiring and keeping the best people. Siloing is not just a culture issue; it’s boxing yourself in. Zak agrees: “the quality of work suffers,” he says. How does Punchkick keep everyone accountable without management? Transparency. “I don’t hide anything,” Zak says. “And I feel like it just results in people I can really trust. Because there’s so much transparency, people don’t want to let down their peers.” Originally published at technori.com on January 2, 2019. -- -- I like to write on stuff; mostly walls and napkins. #entrepreneur #CurbYourEnthusiast, @NorthwesternU grad, @WGNRadio host, and CEO @Technori.

The death of the internet as we know it?,Written by Eko Adetolani," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Eko Adetolani Follow -- Listen Share The internet as we know it might change in 2019 and here is why: The internet is going to be more difficult and boring to use starting in 2019 because of the strict ""Article 13"" regulations currently being considered by the EU. Article 11 and Article 13 which have gained the nicknames “link tax” and “meme ban” respectively. Together they make up the European Union Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market. This has been primarily created to limit how copyrighted content is shared online. Article 13 basically just states that internet companies like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn e.t.c will be sanctioned when a user posts copyrighted material on their platform. Because of the fear of sanctions, everything you post on the internet will go through heavy scrutiny and will most likely be disallowed. This means no more memes, playing songs in the background of your videos, posting educational or funny videos you found on the internet e.t.c Previously it was the job of the content owner (record labels, directors, photographers e.t.c) to find and report use of their material but now it has become the job of the platform owner (Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn e.t.c) to prevent it. How does this affect people outside the EU? Well most social networks just adhere to the strictest rules available and implement it across all their systems regardless of the geographic location. After the implementation of GDPR regulations I’m sure you got notifications of updated privacy policies on all major platforms you use even though you don’t live in a country under the EU…. Well that’s how it works. Could this be the death of the internet as we know it?

2019: The Year of Education,"The digital revolution is at a tipping point. It’s time to rethink why, what, and how we teach.,The re-education of Economics 101,Written by Joe Brooks,#Multidisciplinary Collaboration,#Visionary Thinking,#EdTech,So, What About “How”?"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Joe Brooks Follow Community Works Journal: Digital Magazine for Educators -- Listen Share By ERIK P.M. VERMEULIN Reinventing education is a challenging but urgent task. We are witnessing an exponential growth of technology. Artificial intelligence, sensors, data-analytics, and blockchain (to name a few) are amplifying and accelerating each other. This will lead to new applications across all areas of the economy and society in 2019. In a digital age, any new approach to education needs to adopt a more “skills-based” focus that aims to build creativity. After all, we (and in particular the next generation) must be prepared to live and work more closely with intelligent, networked machines. The main focus of education shouldn’t be on the transfer of knowledge of standardized processes and procedures (these will certainly be automated) but on cultivating innovative and creative skills that cannot easily be replicated by machines. In a world of smart technologies, a premium will be put on the most human of qualities; our capacity for unique and highly personalized forms of self-expression. And all education needs to be re-organized around this goal. I have written about this issue before, but I want to make it more concrete for 2019. Think about it as my New Year’s resolution. We need to get more serious about teaching the skills relevant for a digital age. I’ve already made significant changes to my courses, focusing more on developing student creativity. But next year, I want to go even further by introducing three “new” components: (1) “multidisciplinary collaboration,” (2) “visionary thinking,” and (3) “EdTech.” The Industrial Revolution of the 19th century was the starting point for the process-oriented and proceduralized society we know today. Standardized product development, manufacturing and supply chain processes created efficiencies and led to economic growth and social welfare. Specialization became important. Of course, people still had to work in teams, but each discipline had its responsibilities, and team members relied on each other to bring a unique expertise to the table. Teamwork and collaboration are also crucial to the development of digital technologies and their applications. However, the transition from products to services and the shift in business models from “pipes” (where products are being continually pushed out to consumers) to “platforms” (where stakeholders are creating services/value together) entails that co-creation has become much more important. This means that “multidisciplinary teams” work more closely together. This means that everyone needs to operate beyond their specialty. This has had an enormous impact on team dynamics. Team members need a different skillset in the so-called platform economy. To co-create, it is vital that the members speak each other’s’ language, or at least understand one another. A more open and curious mindset has become a pre-requisite to the success of all teams. Multidisciplinary collaboration must be taught. It needs to become a mandatory part of every curriculum at any level or age. Of course, we still need specialists, but more than ever they have to be open-minded, be able to listen and master the skills to collaborate and communicate effectively. There are plenty of examples of technological disruption. But after watching this Coldfusion video on YouTube, it became clear that companies are not being disrupted by the technologies themselves. Instead, they suffer from a lack of “vision.” When confronted with new technological developments/new technologies (even when they are offered to them), CEOs and other executives point to a long list of inefficiencies concerning the usability, reliability, and adaptability of the new technologies. The telephone was just a “toy.” Television was “boring” (compared to the cinema experience). The energy use of computers was off the charts, preventing it from becoming a mainstream product. Modern smartphones didn’t have a “real keyboard” (and were thus not suitable for business people). In each case, the executives didn’t see the potential of new technologies to disrupt established markets and to become commercially attractive. In each case, there was a failure of vision. Of course, it is too simple to say that we need more visionaries. History shows that these visionaries (who were in the Apple Think Different campaign more than twenty years ago referred to as “the rebels, the troublemakers, the crazy ones, or the geniuses”) are hard to find. This doesn’t mean that we should not pay more attention to the creation of new and fresh perspectives in our educational programs. Again, we are at a tipping point. Technological disruption has become “normalized” and a routine part of everyday work and life. The consequences of the technological revolution go much further than the disruption of a company. Ignoring the speed and magnitude of the disruptive potential of digital technologies could be “catastrophic.” It is, therefore, necessary to teach students the capacity to develop constantly a fresh and new perspective and to revisit the wisdom of the often long-held assumptions, theories, and business models. That is not to say that these models are always wrong, but the capacity for critical thinking helps the students to maintain an open and fresh view of the world. With the developments in artificial intelligence and decentralized technologies (such as blockchain), maintaining a fresh perspective has become a must-have skill. We need more diversity rather than people that know how to follow and execute processes and procedures. qz.com EdTech (or education technology) has a broad definition. It includes everything from the straightforward use of computers to entire online teaching platforms, mobile learning applications, gamification and augmented and virtual reality solutions. In short, it aims to use digital technologies to disrupt education. EdTech companies have been around for about a decade now. Companies in this area started to attract attention from angels, venture capitalists and other risk capital investors in 2010. Looking at the investment data, it appears that there is already a decline in interest in EdTech. Yet, EdTech companies can be expected to generate more attention in 2019. But when I discuss developments in EdTech with my colleagues, it appears that they are still far from up to speed with the latest technologies. The EdTech industry is currently dominated by technologists without the necessary educational experience. But I expect that educators will become more involved next year. For sure, their attitude towards EdTech need to change. It creates significant opportunities to deliver the combination of technological, collaborative and vision-based skills that are necessary in a digital age. What is more important is that EdTech solutions are necessary to develop a learning architecture that helps kickstart the critical cycle of self-learning. And mastering the cycle of self-learning is essential to enable students to learn continually, study and adapt to the new technological developments. I am currently working on setting up partnerships with “EdTech” companies that integrate “EdTech” solutions and strategies in my program/courses. Multidisciplinary collaborations will be stimulated by organizing “hackathons” and other assignments. Teaching “visionary thinking” will be more challenging. One thing is certain. To “produce” thinkers, I need to behave less like a traditional teacher pushing out knowledge to students. I will act more as an influencer and co-creator inspiring students to think and challenge traditional assumptions and models. Grades will largely depend on the way the fresh and new perspectives are explained and supported. I very much look forward to the in-class experience in 2019.

Are Our Educators Prepared For Their Students?,Written by Joe Brooks," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Joe Brooks Follow Community Works Journal: Digital Magazine for Educators -- Listen Share By TOM WHITBY If there is one thing that I am sure of as an educator it is that rapid change greatly affects both what and how we learn. If there is a second thing that I am sure of as an educator it is that the evolution of technology is the driver of rapid change throughout our culture. Both of these factors in education and our culture lead me to question if teachers are being properly prepared to teach students whose learning is affected by so many different influences? The past learning experiences of educators are so different from the current and evolving experiences of their students that relevance as an educator is extremely important. Do today’s teachers understand the learning needs of today’s students? A generational gap is a world of difference in terms of technology. For this reason I feel that many educators are products of a 20th century education that limits them as educators in the 21st century. Of course there are educators who have continually, professionally developed to stay relevant, but maybe not in enough numbers to make a great difference. In the 20th century information was for the most part slower to change and often controlled by a small group of power brokers. News came from newspapers and magazines that were limited to publishing cycles and editors. The media was dominated by three networks which were limited by news cycles and strict editorial boards. Censors were assigned to every entertainment show to regulate the perceived moral agenda. Encyclopedias took years to amend and edit with an additional year to physically publish and were limited in circulation by high costs to the general public. Most households had telephones, but not a private line for each household member. The challenges of rapid change were not yet in place even though the stage was being set. The Vietnam War began to awaken changes in the way we viewed the news. Journalists used more media tools in their reporting. Photos and film began to be broadcast in the news cycle, which was at a family-gathered dinnertime for most Americans. Students were moved by what they saw and many began to demonstrate against the government in numbers never before seen. These demonstrations then became media news as well, which exacerbated the anti-war movement. It took years of this to bring the war to an end, even with the help of the existing technology, which was controlled by forces heavily influenced by the government. This was the way it was until the introduction of cable for more choice in entertainment and 24 hour news reporting. Gaming came along with Pong and later Donkey Kong, followed by The Oregon Trail. Calculators became portable and electronic. Life was good and teaching was pretty much focused on lecture and direct instruction because that was how it was always done. It worked because that was all we knew. The teacher stood in the front and students sat in rows. The Internet was about to take a wrecking ball to that whole mindset prevalent in that century in that world. Now we arrive in the 21st century with all of its technological advances. The Internet provides access to most of information ever to be established in the world. It provides access to entertainment that is often uncensored and unfiltered. Smartphones, which are not really phones, but powerful computers with phone capabilities. People have 24-hour connectivity to any person or source for the purpose of collaboration, curation, or simple communication. Computer-generated games that are realistic and intelligent, that may be played collaboratively and simultaneously with people around the world. What does all of this have to do with our students today is the question that we need to address. Students today have grown up after all of these changes have taken place. Their world is different than many of their educators. It is also continuing to evolve even at a faster pace than ever before experienced and it will continue that way into the future. Today’s students have grown up immersed in technology. They have had access to computers their entire lives. Their smartphones have more power than the computers that were used to put a man on the moon. Students are entertained by shows that they can select from literally hundreds of choices, most uncensored. Their news exposure is 24 hours a day from many sources. They can follow blogs that speak to their interests. They have mastered social media. They are comfortable collaborating with others. They are comfortable creating their own information in the form of text, music, audio, or video. The most important part of this is that their computer is their publisher. They need no adult permission to publish whatever they want to a waiting world on the Internet. They accept failure in games as a challenge to overcome in order to win. They can access any information at anytime to question any facts adults may throw at them. The most important point here is that they can also learn in spite of an irrelevant educator. Information once controlled by academia is now free and easily accessed. Educators should view these technology skills as assets to be supported and enhanced. Critical thinking should be a key to accessing the valid and valued information needed. Collaborative learning should be the focus before lecture and direct instruction. Students who have great choices in their everyday lives should have more of a say in their own learning. Student voice is essential for students to own their learning. Mentoring students in using their technology skills to curate, communicate, and create content is a more effective way to learn than to simply consume teacher-selected content. Educators need to understand that they are teaching kids to live in a world that is not yet here. We are not slow to change any longer. Developing students who are flexible and willing to continually learn is the best we can do to insure their future. Teaching kids how to learn is more important than to teach them what to learn. They will find on their own what it is that they personally need to learn. Preparation for that point in time is what we need to teach them. As I watch these students from Parkland, Florida, I am more convinced that this is the way we must teach. These kids are not “Actors” as some suggest. They are articulate, intelligent, technology savvy students who have a need to learn, create, collaborate, and communicate. They do it so well; it causes 20th century thinkers to question their validity. They are real, and now have a cause and a purpose with the skills to present it to their country. I am not saying that all teachers are not doing their best to teach. I believe that most are doing their very best. I also believe that in a world where change is so rapid, the tools that educators have been prepared with may no longer serve that purpose. We need to continually train educators more than one or two days in a year. Irrelevant teachers are the fault of the districts in which they work. If we are to better educate our kids, we must first better educate their educators.

You will be able to book cabs, order food and check your feed all in one platform. To be more succinct, social media will be an all-in-one app or platform for your daily needs and tasks. 2. Richness in quality of posts: The quality of social media posts will be rich in content and variety. As of now, you can see high-quality photos on Instagram. This will transcend all platforms. On top of that, the new IGTV feature in Instagram is gaining a ton of traction which will eventually convert to a mini YouTube sort of thing (already happening). These examples suggest a pattern or hint towards what we can expect in the future. 3. Videos: The Internet is more accessible now than ever. Facebook recently announced that it would focus more on delivering videos to your news feed and suggested that videos were the future in social media. If you are a frequent user of Facebook, you may have already noticed this trend. Facebook is going to add more videos to your newsfeed. 4. Customizable: Social media platforms will adhere to your preferences, tastes, and needs. This means that you will be able to select the themes and layout, customize the tabs, and design the layout you want from a selection of combinations. 5. Mobile-friendly: If you head over to the Instagram website on your PC and login, you will notice that it doesn’t allow for messages and has limited features. Instagram is totally mobile-based and this is what the social media giants and new social media platforms will come up with in the future. They will focus entirely on mobile. 6. Experimental: Social media will undergo a ton of experiments. These experiments will make the user experience much better. These may include the use of Virtual reality, 3D images or videos, Artificial Intelligence etc. 7. Integration: Since social media already has a lot of data (contacts, numbers, people information etc.), it is effortless to add a payment app or integrate with payment gateway or other similar features making social media friendlier and easier to use. However, privacy is a concern which brings us to the next point. 8. Privacy: Social media companies are taking privacy more seriously now more than over. Since, they have accumulated a lot of contact details, personal details etc. they bear a public responsibility to protect and secure the data. Data in the wrong hands can be misused and the consequences can be severe. 9. Sharing of data: This point is subtle but powerful. With the help of your social media usage, companies gather small data over time, and these will help other companies like e-commerce or any ad companies to understand your likes, preferences and spending habits. This will allow the companies to advertise the product you want and make sure that you see it. This will result in effective advertising. This is highly beneficial to companies. You may argue that this is already in process, however, it is also worthy to note that this feature will enhance and get more accurate. 10. Community building: To an extent, small communities will stop building websites and instead use social media as their main source of communication both internally and externally. With bots, communities will be able to get in touch and answer customers’ queries easily and effortlessly. This will encourage more communities in the long-run. 11. More Real: Though we are coming across thousands of photo-shopped Instagram images, we are also learning that expressing authenticity is equally important. This awareness has already been initiated and slowly getting popular. On a broader perspective, these are the 11 ways social media will evolve and make our lives and business better. If you have any more points, do let us know. Thanks for reading. -- -- Software development: owner of innovative time-tracking solutions — cloud based and desktop software.

"Welcome to the World of Simple, Yet Complex",Written by Ady Purnama," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Ady Purnama Follow -- Listen Share Cloud, mobile, QR code, mobile payment, big data, AI, Integration, IoT, social media What is so cool today, would be left behind in few months or weeks. Name it, Friendster beaten up by Facebook. Path which very well known in Indonesia, only survive last then 2 years. Instagram so far the most popular social media in 2016–2018, but let see in couple years ahead.Facebook is now declining due to issue of privacy and stereotype for older person. People is so easy to get bored On the other hand, with the ease of software development, so (too) many solutions arise. Most of millennial are very creative, they create e-solution for almost everything. Do you want to save money? Go to bank, mobile banking, online investment, trading online.Do you need transportation? Book online, traveloka, pegipegi, tiket.com, etc.Do you hungry? Go to “warung”, go-food, grab-food, call delivery serviceWant to save photo? Go to google photos, instagram, facebook, NASHow about boring? Get netflix, buy voucher traveloka, open youtube So many alternatives to ease you, but its getting complex on the other hand. It was easy to define how much money do you have? Sum up your bank account, gold and house.Now? Don’t forget your mutual fund account in asset management X, Y, Z. Sum up also your bitcoin account, that might be fluctuated like roller coaster. Hmm..also you still have credit in GoPay. It seems you still have deposit also in OVO and Dana. How about credit in M-Tix, that’s part of your wealth also. And you can list down, as much as you can (remember). It’s good to have a broaden knowledge about new technology/solutions arise. But keep your life simple! So many solutions that alike one another. If you take it all, you’ll ended up with too complex life. Review new solutions arise, if it’s better then migrate, don’t duplicate. Here’re my own list for some function of life:* file storage for personal: use google drive* file storage for business: onedrive plus sharepoint (soon)* bank: use 1 main account, and 1 more account for saving. Other bank? has been closed!* investment: don’t put your egg in one basket still applicable. So differentiate the risks, but simplify the variety. Buy some golds, mutual funds, stocks, properties. -- -- Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:88:88/0*0ZSrCimNFlAMheGJ', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1500/1*a0GXzOqPcsHx_dvGlb1glw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:6690/1*xdwlRu8wwsu1T2VaBDTIhA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:144:144/0*0ZSrCimNFlAMheGJ', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*ZNahGS7EwPcevYHO_VutiA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*Diwc1DIGQArX7GSHdVtlXA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*OXfc8u07G_0gfOHaxpoctQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*_eYHSSUS0abUxmDU', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*wXgeNtz5OJ5O9T3c3mQRRw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/0*tIipcmrInD5UMpQI.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@ady.purnama?source=post_page-----1da76d179b85--------------------------------,1,2 min read

When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me.” (I Corinthians 13:11) “Improvising: having the skill to go with the mistake, rather than against it.” Elements of Jazz: From Cakewalks to Fusion (The Great Courses, Chantilly, VA) We learn a skill by following prescribed practices, connected and time-phased by scripts — we plan. We then learn to improvise as we select, modify, and perform these practices on the fly. Planning When we are first learning a craft, whether it is public speaking, music, project management, or cooking, we accumulate a toolkit of skills, one tool at a time, along with some concept of the rules for the use of each. At first, we learn one basic tool, such as the hammer, finding out which end to hold, what part is used to drive the nail, how hard to hit, and the like. We eventually master the use of the hammer, learning the “what,” but we have yet to learn the “why” — just when do you use a hammer? Then, to execute an entire project, we must learn the “what” and the “why” of many tools — saw, level, adhesives — and learn the script for moving from one tool to another. Building the script of the sequence of which tool to use when, and how to use it, constitutes the planning of an endeavor. Giving a talk? Then perhaps you write out each word of what you plan to say. Then you likely read it. Your audience cringes as it receives the muttered, over planned results of your preparation. Perhaps you advance to using bullet points, either on a notecard or on a projected slide, simply to tell you what you wish to describe next. Maybe you give yourself a running start by writing out only the first sentence or two of your talk, then move to the bullet points. In like manner, as exemplified by the image of two settings of George and Ira Gershwin’s song “Love Walked In,” we can try to script every possible nuance of playing that song, as shown in the left image of an arrangement by Percy Grainger. “Slowly flowly” is the tempo, and the score on a later page even advises how to play the trill like woggle: “N.B. The woggle should be played as fast as possible, but not necessarily with an exact number of woggle-notes to the beat.” Too much detail? Not at all! The piano arrangement fits together like a tightly-crafted Swiss watch. Its construction is as much an art as its source material. However, the artist playing it will spend dozens of hours learning it. Several artists, plus my own experience, suggest that it might take 2,000 times the length of a piece to practice it to the point of playing it, from memory, as well as one’s technique permits. For this four-minute piece, that would constitute 133 hours. In like manner, rules have developed for various games. If chess player White moves this way, then player Black should move that way. People even “game” business meetings with potential clients by planning: “If they ask this, you answer that!” Likewise, a comprehensive set of tools has developed for planning projects, from jobs as simple as mowing the lawn to as complicated as building a bridge. Quality initiatives seek to document the processes used to execute complicated endeavors, hence providing ways to educate newcomers, assurance that steps are completed in the right order, and means to memorize changes discovered that can improve the process. However, “Man plans and God laughs.” We carefully fit together the pieces of the foundation like a puzzle, and it looks soooo right… until several stages later, when we find that we built the left side one row shorter than the right side. In quality terms, we have introduced a defect early in the process that was not discovered until late in the process. This is clearly a mistake. If we are sufficiently skilled, we can “go with the mistake” as in the quote above; otherwise, we go waayy back to correct it. Seated in your playspace, your goal ahead of you, your tools surrounding you, you begin to advance toward your goal. Making it up as you go, you address each obstacle as it occurs, just as if you are driving in the face of stop lights, pedestrians, traffic, and errant animals. You have far less advance planning at your disposal, but you have an end goal and a set of intermediate goals. Instead of the musical score on the left of the image, detailing every note and how it is to be played with copious amounts of ink, you have the sparse notation of chord, melody, and lyric on the right of the image. For each step of your journey, you are choosing the best actions at the moment. You are hoping that a series of right choices, guided by experience over long time, will get you to your goal with reasonable efficiency. You are, in fact, performing dynamic optimization, solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a sequence of individual smaller problems. In an ideal situation, where predictions are accurate, unexpected events (late workers, tariff-constrained material shortages and the like) do not occur. In that ideal situation, end-to-end planning will likely yield a route that is more efficient than any route taken by stringing together a sequence of locally-optimum paths. After all, packing your suitcase by first laying everything out on the bed results in denser packing than fetching each item from its drawer and packing it as you remember it. But in the face of noise (unexpected events) occurring along the way, the dynamic optimization (“invention,” or “improvisation”) allows instant adaptation to obstacles, rather than slavishly following a plan despite unexpected events. Continuing our musical analogy, the right-hand image of the jazz lead sheet is played by inventing the particular voicing of each chord and playing the melody. Fundamental skills needed for the complete left-hand score include knowledge of the chords shown (C, D7, etc.), whether to play chords in the lower staff with melody in the upper hand or instead play the chords in inversions that place the melody on top, and how to smoothly transition, from one chord to the next, with minimal intervals between each chord tone (i.e., “voice leading”). “Noise” in this case can consist of the band leader unexpectedly telling you at the start of a repetition to take a solo, or your own discovery that the bass player is providing a strong bass line so that the piano does not need to, or that a singer is singing and your piano should not double her melody. Likewise, in giving a talk, you may have your bullet points at hand as reminders, but as you notice the audience beginning to snooze, you may improvise your presentation to become a bit more lively, using anything from speaking louder and with more energy (or pausing in silence) to walking around to skipping the particular section that is causing slumber. Neither of these examples of adaptive behavior — modifying either the music or the speech in response to conditions of the moment — is captured by the excruciating completeness of either a note-for-note musical score or a word-for-word written script. You are inventing. Advancing from planned to improvised activity is aided by several factors: All of these factors require experience with planned versions of the endeavor. To achieve facility with tools, one may memorize the actions of many scripted endeavors, to the point of being able to immediately recall and execute similar past patterns when faced with a real-time situation. It may be scales and chord voicings in music, such as the ii-V-I chord sequence that occurs in many keys. Gaining the confidence to make mistakes at low cost also comes with experience. A non-threatening audience for a talk, for example, may be developed by actually circulating through the audience and chatting with members before your presentation, so that you are presenting to Joe and Mary, not just to a faceless mass of people. Technology aids the obtaining of rapid feedback. No longer does one prepare a deck of IBM computer cards, hand them to the operator at a window, and wait while nibbling on fingernails while the computer program is run to see whether it crashed due to error on your part. Rarely now does one hand a document to a secretary for typing and receive it back for editing. Computers are programmed and run immediately on the desktop; writing is read immediately upon typing. How does one efficiently gain the experience required for transition from planning to invention? One may as well ask how to accelerate the acquisition of a year of experience. Methods include an experienced teacher, practice of fundamental exercises, and frequent “performances” of the task, whether it is music, rhetoric, or carpentry. This is a topic that I look forward to examining further. The adage of good planning is “Measure twice, cut once.” Perhaps the adage of good invention becomes “Measure once, cut once, repeat.” Maybe it is “fail early and adapt.” -- -- Revelling at the intersection of Art (music -> piano -> jazz) and Science (signal processing -> recognition -> estimation & classification) Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*M2Qv1T6L_CE63A9Z6xQtxA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*TIfDn1MB_pVgkslwjOChrQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*M2Qv1T6L_CE63A9Z6xQtxA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*I_WhhreTBwpIax1r54wsrw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*M2Qv1T6L_CE63A9Z6xQtxA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*No8ppArXyvBOLe_8y1CGkg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*M2Qv1T6L_CE63A9Z6xQtxA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*0rGCTAVn34lGv29PsNsvlg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rWmgFdR3mnGCAsBWceMA6w.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*sQ46xgiQWHI2wHUM7dutdg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*mO_hWqWFhlbNCeT0ITcYVg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*5xHGWU-uFy55Mdxas9e2Gw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*piXpySzrCZ3B2xeztiNF-Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*JmuGp_3SnZp4JnV0Yq8Akg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/0*jYOUtiTChQS53oIx.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*FLQrqUn8NcT2dcSj8YJbEw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*nChshyHhYer985FIUWu6TA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*maC8NLpto3tNwluhoRODsw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*-Y9ozbNWSViiCmal1TT32w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*AscZbV1rFfGzqjJX8ofzNw.png']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@john_goodyear?source=post_page-----beedce3d8fbb--------------------------------,0,7 min read
The 6 Most Common Cyber Security Mistakes Your Employees Are Making,Written by Lazarus_Alliance," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Lazarus_Alliance Follow -- Listen Share With an estimated 90% of cyber attacks caused by human error or behavior, it’s important to understand the most common cyber security mistakes your employees are probably making and know how to mitigate them. Becoming victims of phishing schemes Stolen login credentials are the most common way hackers breach enterprise systems, and most of the time, these credentials are stolen through a phishing scheme. A highly targeted variant of phishing, called spear phishing or business email compromise, is used to convince employees to wire money or send sensitive data, such as W2 information, to cyber criminals. Avoid having your employees make this cyber security mistake by educating them about the warning signs of a phishing scheme. Organizations must also establish policies against sending sensitive data through email, ensure that employees have access only to the systems and data they need to do their jobs, and add redundancy into payment approval processes, especially wire transfers. Mistakes involving login credentials This is a broad category of cyber security mistakes that includes: Most of these security mistakes can be avoided through employee education on the dangers of not keeping login credentials secure. Organizations can also employ technical measures to force login sessions to automatically time out when a terminal is inactive, require the use of MFA, and automatically generate strong passwords. Using shadow IT software and services Over three-quarters of employees admit to using shadow IT software and services at the workplace. Most of the time, their intentions are not malicious. They are simply trying to do their jobs better, and they do not realize how dangerous shadow IT can be to security and compliance. Employee education is the best way to head off this security mistake. Technical tools can also be employed to ferret out shadow IT apps. Inserting “mystery” devices into workplace computers A common social engineering tactic is for hackers to leave USB thumb drives and other plugin devices in public areas where employees will find them. Sometimes, the devices will have labels meant to entice employees to want to covertly access them, such as “Q4 Performance Reviews” or indicating that the device contains pornographic content. Employees must be educated about the dangers of making this security mistake. Making security mistakes when using public WiFi Free public WiFi networks are ubiquitous, found everywhere from fast-food restaurants to aboard trains. Remote workers and employees who frequently travel for business often take advantage of public WiFi to work on the go. As with shadow IT apps, this is usually because of a security mistake, not maliciousness or negligence; employees don’t realize how dangerous public WiFi is. In addition to educating employees on best practices when accessing public WiFi networks, organizations should provide VPN access to all employees who work remotely. Not protecting computers and other IoT devices This security mistake involves physical protection as well as password protection. In a recent survey, over half of working adults admitted to allowing friends and family to access devices given to them by their employers. Employees who travel for work may also leave devices unattended in public areas or hotel rooms or allow strangers to “borrow” their smart phones. Employees who travel need to be educated about best cyber practices when traveling. Organizations should ensure that these employees’ devices are protected with strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, or a biometric lock. If possible, have disposable phones and laptops on hand to loan to employees for travel purposes. If an employee must travel with a device that contains sensitive data, make sure the device is encrypted.

SmartBug’s Lucky 13: Favorite Marketing Tools Our Team Uses To Execute Intelligent Inbound,Written by Jen Spencer," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Jen Spencer Follow SmartBug Media -- Listen Share Marketing and sales practices and technology are always evolving. As professionals, if we continue to do what we have always done, we’ll miss out on opportunities to grow. At SmartBug Media, our team is full of knowledge hogs. Whether it’s the latest and greatest or someone else’s tried and true, we want to know everything there is to know about it. Despite being a 100 percent remote team, we participate in bi-weekly all-hands meetings via Zoom (our “Brady Bunch” images are awesome). During a recent gathering, each SmartBug team member answered this question: In addition to HubSpot (which is the foundation of our technology stack), what marketing tools have you discovered in the last year that have significantly helped you grow as an intelligent inbound professional? The recommendations were too good not to share with our community of subscribers. Paul Schmidt, Marketing Strategist Recommendation: Moz Keyword Explorer’s Competitor Functionality “This is my secret sauce to understanding the breadth of topics that competitors are owning in organic search. As part of any SEO-related campaign, I use this tool to see if there are other keywords that I should be targeting, as well as to understand the kinds of content that rank well for a given set of topics.” Nicki Kamau, Marketing Director Recommendation: Databox “When I want to report on a campaign’s effectiveness, HubSpot is my initial go-to, but sometimes I want to verify or expand on the data I’m seeing, and then I hop into Google Analytics. With Databox, I’m able to configure a dashboard for myself that aggregates the data I’m looking for from both platforms, automatically. Databox also delivers the dashboard to my inbox, saving me time.” Jennifer Lux, (now former) Marketing Strategist and Team Lead Recommendation: Spiceworks “This excellent resource for IT companies conducts and publishes market surveys frequently that quantify the evolving technology landscape. Spiceworks provides research to help optimize IT lead generation with meaningful market insights.” Drew Cohen, Marketing Strategist and Team Lead Recommendation: LocationScan by Yext “Many times, when it comes to local SEO, companies don’t know where to start. By having a nifty little tool that shows your directory and citation listings, LocationScan by Yext can really give you a great foundation to build off of.” Other team recommendations include the following: GaggleAMP for social media engagement and reach amplificationSEMRush for competitive intelligenceLumen5 for AI-powered video creationHotjar for website heatmaps and visitor recordingsReturnPath for email deliverabilityBrokenLinkCheck.com checks your website for broken links :-)Google Tag Manager for managing JavaScript and HTML tags used for tracking and analyticsCoverageBook, a reporting tool to measure impact of public relationsEmail on Acid measures email across the most popular clients, apps, and devices Have you had great experiences with these marketing tools? What is the SmartBug team missing? Share the tool or tactic that helps you make your inbound sales and inbound marketing more intelligent.

2019 Yapay Zeka’nın Yılı Mı Olacak?,"LG’ye göre 2019 yapay zekanın yılı olacak…,2019 yılı yapay zekanın yılı olacak, ancak 5G’de 2019 yılında çok şey yapacak. Neler mi olacak? Haberin devamında…,Written by Moblobi,HABERİN DEVAMINI OKUMAK İÇİN BURAYA TIKLAYIN!"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Moblobi Follow -- Share Teknoloji sektöründe 2018 yılı oldukça heyecan verici geçti. Özellikle yapay zekayı çok daha fazla duyar, çok daha fazla konuşur oldu. Üstelik bu alana yapılan yatırımlar da 2018 yılında arttı. Forbes’un paylaştığına göre işletmelerin yüzde 80’i bu yıla kadar yapay zekaya yatırım yaparken; yüzde 30’u ise gelecek 3 sene içinde yapay zeka yatırımlarını arttırmayı planlıyor. Aslında 1950 yılından beri hayatımızın içinde olan yapay zekanın tüketicilerin avantajlarına olan yönü yakın zamana kadar far edilmemişti. 2018 yılı bunun için bir dönüm yılı oldu ve yapay zekanın temellerini oluşturdu. Yapay zeka artık hayatlarımızın içine girmeye başladı. Artık eskisi kadar uzak ve korkulacak bir yanı olmadığını aslında hayatımızı kolaylaştıracak pek çok avantajı sunduğunu biraz daha keşfettik tüketiciler olarak… Örneğin robotlar evdeki yardımcılar haline geldi, televizyonlar o kadar inceldi ki neredeyse evdeki tablolarımız yerine geçti. Gelişmiş teknolojileriyle tanıdığımız ve inovatif bakış açısını ürünlerine de taşıyan LG Electronics (LG) ‘ye göre 2019 yılı yapay zekanın yılı olacak ve bu yılda yapay zeka hayatlarımızın içine büyük bir adım atacak. Yapay zeka 2019’da artık sadece evlerimizde değil her yerde ihtiyaç duyduğumuz bir konu haline gelecek. Hatta kendilerinin de LG Electronics (LG) olarak tüketici beklentilerinin de üstünde ThinQ altında sunduğu yapay zeka ürünlerine de daha fazla eğileceklerini belirtiyorlar. -- -- Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*fC0rzaIzCop26jdM.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/0*Hi2FmNnrsmeESml7.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/0*CzG2phxmATcRSHXG.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/0*fC0rzaIzCop26jdM.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*x7cJaVAFqIMlNJtb.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*fC0rzaIzCop26jdM.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*BCavLB2Ch5eJuJGJ.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*fC0rzaIzCop26jdM.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*tfndSQZMj2iUdGNA.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*fC0rzaIzCop26jdM.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*uDm499XFdmaa4xcc.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*fC0rzaIzCop26jdM.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*vzu3JPzaq2EZKTZNY9BhLA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*lEmL62oZdrOOWIzAAFKiFg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*i2zLIwC9mftamP1dbciCeQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*cBIFfjjqzx8pzaemnAM0rQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*EhiV5eo34TIkvI6u-JFYmg.jpeg']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@moblobi?source=post_page-----6d7ff0fffb09--------------------------------,0,2 min read
Written by The Chief,," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in The Chief Follow The Chief -- Listen Share Hello and welcome to my blog. My name is Luis, but I go by my nickname, “Chief” I’m not entirely sure why, but some guys in college started calling me that, but it has stuck with me over the years. My personality is one of assertiveness, and I tend to research, project plan and act. I’ve been an IT professional for 18 years, and an IT consultant for 13 of them and the assertiveness has certainly benefited me throughout my career which started just with helping small businesses with their tech needs and over time has morphed into an operations and business consultant as well as an outsourced project manager. Virtually all of today’s business depends on technology, this much we all know. The part that’s not so readily apparent is that for the technology to be successful, the right person all must be in place to leverage it. Technology by itself offers no value, and in some cases, it’s counterproductive to business. Most of my articles will revolve around technology, security, efficiency, process, and procedures. I’m also a husband, father, and sports fan. So I may include articles that I feel are relevant slightly interesting that are worth writing about. I meant to start this blog a year ago, but I simply didn’t make the time to do so. I hope to write at least one article per week as I’ve been keeping notes from time to time so I should have some decent material. Refer to the contact link if you if you want to email or you can hit me out on various social media networks with Twitter probably being the best way.

Paradigm Shift in Corporate Banking on Blockchain Adoption,Written by Farhang Maghdeed," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Farhang Maghdeed Follow -- Listen Share Over the past thirty years, central banks focused on fighting inflation globally and have been failing. Given that inflation has been identified as the major culprit in most of the global depression since the 1920’s to today, no wonder most financial institutions have made it their target trying to control and manage it. However, it was the financial crisis of 2008 that led to deeper questioning of economic processes, credit system and debt management. The recession pointed out a gap in the public’ trust in financial institutions and governments due to the lack of transparency and accountability in financial world. The question on everyone’s mind is: will this stop, or it will continue? Are there any solutions out there that can prevent the collapse of financial fundamentals that are built around a centralised system? Not a question with an easy or short answer, but the smart money seems to be on blockchain architecture that is using cutting edge technology to build trust and transparency. Blockchain platform are attracting the attention of financial service sector to its innovative technology that is set to change the future and it has emerged as a new paradigm in the financial industry. In 2016, the World Economic Forum (WEF) predicted that blockchain will revolutionize financial services, and build a solid platform where consumers and producers / buyers and sellers will converge. The financial sector however, is apprehensive considering the technology’s link to cryptocurrencies and evolving blockchain technology use in other sectors. In 2017, the banking sector and remittance industry experienced industry disruptions and large-scale mergers. By the end of the year, a consensus between the banking sector and blockchain technologists were reached. In the first quarter of 2018 several banks started adopting and testing the technology in phases. Decentralised Ledger Technology (DLT) has created the “internet of value” by empowering peer to peer, transparent, immediate and almost free exchanges of value over the internet awakening the banking industry the real possibility of their demise and effectively killing the stranglehold they have on the financial markets, not a pretty thought if you are involved in the finance business. According to Statistics, from 2016 to 2021 it is estimated that blockchain technology is heating the global market aggressively, with the Blockchain industry market reacing 339.5 Million USD in size and is forecast to grow to 2.3 billion USD by 2021. Although banks and financial institutions have always been at the frontline of the technology evolution, it is very interesting to know they are preparing for a true battle. Who will win? Who will emerge triumphant and reap the spoils of war? It’s really too early to tell yet, but for Blockchain the future is bright. -- -- Experiences in Blockchain | Metaverse | Security Token | Fintech Analyst | Fintech Writer | Digital Economy Expert | Digital Finance & Economy writer| Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:7500/1*-VrbPJa3y6boVy2y6G5m7Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*-T9ZOp6pGanhk_ZsEZIHsA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*-T9ZOp6pGanhk_ZsEZIHsA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*6FJaAVSlTXg34NnYd2hikw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*-T9ZOp6pGanhk_ZsEZIHsA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*8KW3ur1xtVsPa3PIDU242Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*oOX_Iqy8_AuYyZnd2RoQ6Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*EHghvYZ4WyCkecT66tau8g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*oOX_Iqy8_AuYyZnd2RoQ6Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wwZxPrX9p4AYSEvbd7wpbQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*-T9ZOp6pGanhk_ZsEZIHsA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*QtSp-QdCNWNysIIwz-tQSA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*lOVIKQR7sxSghI8VuTAbHw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*dnXyohMVIFsRq2UtQyRD6g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*TGDWp9kQBbI7K_Ij.', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*-PS6oMeaJG5dRLPxg1L6PA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*ahIxB6HS49zEmm6AuHexYg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*eYh7bD3XhdEiolo2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*UOwQVZKhmz3S1YcACLqDvQ.jpeg']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@farhang.maghdeed?source=post_page-----7aea67809a78--------------------------------,0,2 min read
Written by Joseph DiTomaso,," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Joseph DiTomaso Follow -- Listen Share How Technology Has Changed Travel Not long ago, going on a trip meant calling to book a hotel, printing out directions on MapQuest, and driving to your destination with a packed car. Those days are over. With the rise of technology, it has transformed not only how we travel, but where we stay. Luxe accommodations are popping up seemingly everywhere, with plenty of mobile apps and noise-canceling headphones to elevate your booking and traveling experience. The secret to success Technology brought us the internet, and what a wonderful thing that is. Something else it’s brought us? Ads. Booking.com is a leading travel e-commerce company and what it’s done right is target its “customers at the exact point of intended purchase” using Google Adwords. Another secret to its success is that the site is optimized for customer conversion through the use of A/B testing. Booking.com is constantly on the hunt for the right combination of factors that will result in a conversion. Only a click away The Instant Book feature on Airbnb’s website is akin to the “Buy now with 1-click” button on Amazon. It’s rise in popularity with customers is largely due to the instantaneous and seamless nature of the transaction. For the company, its potential to improve online conversion rates keeps the feature around. Additionally, “the instant book trend has proven to be a great tool to combat market saturation.” It’s not surprising then that 52% of the total inventory on Airbnb is instantly bookable, making it the faster, easier choice for finalizing your accommodations. The future of travel According to John McCarthy, president of The GO Group, “As the economy continues to improve and the unemployment rate remains low, people will have the means to travel more frequently both for leisure and business.” In 2019, it’s expected that we’ll see a boost in travel, online bookings, and the tourism market. 2019 travel tech Keeping up with digital trends in travel isn’t just a good idea, it’s a necessity that positively impacts customer service and allows you to stay ahead of competitors. One of the most important digital trends that those in the tourism industry must adapt to in order to successfully optimise business performance is mobile integration. Combined with IoT technology, mobile apps can give guests a sense of control by allowing them to adjust room appliances or lights straight from their phone. It may seem insignificant, but it’s a simple, seamless, and expected way to delight your customers. Another trend is personalization, which if done right, can contribute to an excellent customer experience. Machine learning technology helps customize the perfect experience for guests using complex algorithms that can make forecasts about needs based on their behavior. But the technology that travel industry professionals are most excited about going into 2019? Artificial intelligence. This doesn’t come as much of a surprise given the extreme popularity of AI in other various industries. This technology, according to a recent poll conducted by Travel Technology Europe, is going to be invested primarily in chatbots. This trend reflects the growing recognition that personalisation and tailored experiences are key within travel marketing because customers will not tolerate generic, irrelevant marketing any longer. “Through the use of chat, voice and machine learning, a traveller can look forward to a more interactive and relevant conversation with travel brands that have recognised that, to be successful, they need to embrace these emerging technologies now,” Sagittarius CEO and Advisory Board Member for Travel Technology Europe, Paul Stephen said.

10 Reasons Why Social Media Marketing is Indispensable for Your Business Today.,Written by Daniel Bernard," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Daniel Bernard Follow -- Listen Share Social Media is one of the most powerful tools in the marketing sector today. It has created a platform and foundation that will allow all types of companies to share their creative work and get recognized globally. Therefore, we have compiled 10 reasons to help you understand how social media can effectively grow your business and get you new customers. 1. Brand Awareness — When you post on Facebook about the brand, almost anyone in the world can view it and engage with your post. This opens the gateway to so many opportunities and prospective customers. 2. Increase in Sales — This is the most sought-after consequence for business owners after they make their brand presence known on social media. New prospective customers in and around the local area get to know about your brand and will choose to try out your brand. If it is e-commerce, then you will have a lot of requests for shipping from abroad or local areas. It will depend on your brand category or your industry. However, it will surely contribute to more sales. 3. Better Understanding of the marketplace — Once your brand gets recognized on social media, you will start to understand the marketplace better. You will get more awareness about your competitors, the current trends as well as the general overview of the demand and supply of the products/services. This will assist you in refining your product/service and empower you to sell better and create an overall pleasant experience. 4. New ideas — By interacting with customers online and getting valuable insights from data, you will be able to get new ideas for your current product/service or maybe even about a whole new different product. Ideas come from a variety of new experiences and that’s exactly what the social media promises. 5. Accountability — Social media gives you accurate data and if you are running ads, then you will be able to track more closely. By using this data, you can fine-tune your marketing strategies as well as proactively make changes to your customer support and service. 6. Customer Satisfaction — Companies have been able to respond to customer’s query better on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. Social media allows for instant replies and decreases the response time between the customer and company. This will save time for both the company and the customer plus actions can easily be taken and this results in a good system for customer support which indeed adds to customer satisfaction. 7. Cost effective — You can create a twitter or a Facebook account for free and a Facebook business page is also zero cost. This will help you to create valuable and high-quality content which you can share with your followers. Just a tip: People always appreciate good content, so deliver the same and you will get good reach in no time. 8. Monitor and Control — It is easy and effortless to control and maintain your social media account. In this way, you can always monitor, edit, repost and engage without much apprehension because you are always in control of your account. In addition to this, social media is accessible and portable. You can take care of your brand’s social media account from any corner of the world. 9. Opportunities — Your brand’s enhanced social presence is surely going to attract new opportunities for you. It may appear in any form- as business opportunities or a lot of new customer opportunities. Example: You are a caterer. A customer in the local area looks up on Facebook for ‘caterers’. Your brand name pops up with several 5-star reviews and tons of Facebook page likes. The prospective customer will take a look at the page and contact you for further details. This can happen in many ways for various types of industries. 10. Launch products/services — After creating a solid follower base, you can get to launch products/services directly on social media networks (live or not). This will create a ripple of engagement with your present customers, attract new customers and help your brand gain a lot of attention. Also, this will direct a lot of traffic towards your website and in the end, result in more sales. These are some of the crucial reasons as to why social media will make your business more prosperous and better.

4 Benefits of an Online Savings Account — Tejesh Kodali,Written by Tejesh Kodali," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Tejesh Kodali Follow -- Listen Share For anyone, the idea of being able to make more money and secure your financial stability is appealing. People are constantly looking for side hustles to earn more money and ways to save the money they’ve already made. In the last few years, online banks and savings accounts have risen in popularity and offer a fantastic solution to traditional banking. While many people are wary of using a solely online bank and trusting their money to that entity, with research, you can find a great bank that provides better benefits than those of a brick-and-mortar financial institution. Better interest For most people, the greatest appeal of an online bank is that you’ll have a much greater interest rate for your savings account. Since an online bank does not have to worry about the cost of maintaining physical bank locations and hiring hundreds of employees, they’re able to offer a greater interest rate for your money, some as high as 2.0%. This number is incredibly appealing when compared to the average interest rate at a traditional bank, which is around 0.04%. Many people opt to continue to use a traditional bank for their checking account, but put their savings in an online account. Equal security Many are under the false assumption that online banks are simply not safe. However, online banks and traditional banks both have about the same amount of online security risks, since even traditional banks offer online banking. In order to make sure your money is as safe as possible, double check that the online bank you’re considering working with is FDIC insured and take security measures such as only accessing your account from secure WiFi and regularly changing your password. More options While online banks usually do not provide as many options such as various types of checking and savings accounts, loans, or insurance options, there are plenty of banks you can choose from for a savings (or a basic checking) account. Online banks have to compete with one another to offer the best options, interest rates, and security, so you have plenty to choose from. Take your time to do your research and see what institution best meets your financial needs. Convenience Another great perk is the convenience that many online banks offer.

Londres pone en marcha un ambicioso programa de reconocimiento facial,Written by Balam Seguridad Privada," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Balam Seguridad Privada Follow -- Share La Navidad ya se divisa en el horizonte y las grandes ciudades europeas se preparan para acoger las tradicionales -y multitudinarias- celebraciones que acompañan a tan entrañables fechas. Por desgracia, distintos factores han motivado que la seguridad haya escalado posiciones en la planificación de cualquier evento navideño. Londres ha ido un paso más allá y ha diseñado un ambicioso programa de reconocimiento facial para identificar a cualquier posible sospechoso que se adentre en el centro de la ciudad. ¿Una medida necesaria o excesiva? El debate está servido. La Policía londinense desarrollará durante la Navidad una campaña de reconocimiento facial que tendrá dos líneas de actuación. En primer lugar, se creará un amplio fichero con los rostros de aquellos transeúntes que deseen participar en el programa. Para ello, agentes policiales debidamente identificados solicitarán a los ciudadanos que se dejen escanear el rostro. De este modo, los británicos contribuirán a agilizar el trabajo de la Policía a la hora de controlar grandes masas de personas. La segunda parte de la campaña consistirá en la instalación de cámaras de vídeo con la tecnología de reconocimiento facial integrada. Hasta aquí, las ventajas de la campaña son evidentes. Los agentes de Policía que están trabajando desde los diferentes centros de control pueden seguir en tiempo real la situación de las calles londinenses y, cuando aparezca un sospechoso, el sistema de reconocimiento facial activará la alarma pertinente. Conviene recordar que Reino Unido ha sufrido varios atentados terroristas de carácter islamista en los últimos años, al tiempo que el inminente Brexit ha generado una mayor sensación de inseguridad entre buena parte de la población. Con todo, tan invasivo protocolo de vigilancia no ha gustado a todos. La organización Big Brother Watch ha calificado el nuevo operativo policial londinense como “autoritario, peligroso e ilegal”. Autoritario porque supone ceder a las autoridades la potestad de reconocernos en cualquier situación y sin que medie una orden judicial (en principio, de manera voluntaria). Peligroso porque una cesión de ese calibre puede volverse en nuestra contra si alguien logra hackear el sistema de vigilancia. Ilegal porque, salvo que se modifique la legislación vigente (y no está previsto un movimiento en este sentido, no es lícito grabar a los transeúntes de manera indiscriminada. Por ahora, los policías de Londres sortean este último obstáculo con la petición formal a los ciudadanos para que colaboren con el operativo. La seguridad es una de nuestras grandes preocupaciones y en este espacio te comentaremos qué papel puede jugar la tecnología.

Human Genomic Databases need more minority participation,Written by Jaymie White," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Jaymie White Follow Supplierty News -- Listen Share www.suppliertynews.com We are currently undergoing a major transition in the STEM field of genomic research. While some people may look at the word genomes and immediately think genetics there is a difference. According to WHO, “The main difference between genomics and genetics is that genetics scrutinizes the functioning and composition of the single gene where as genomics addresses all genes and their inter relationships in order to identify their combined influence on the growth and development of the organism.” Identifying their combined influence is key in today’s scientific market. What doctors around the world are now learning pertains to the importance of ethnic diversity in clinical trial research. “Human genomic databases — collections of all the genetic information that has been sequenced over the years — are” heavily skewed to people of European descent, making it harder to correctly diagnose medical issues for non-Europeans. According to Scientific American, “The community has learned that there are far more of these larger, so-called structural variations than expected. These are now known to cause genetic disease and impact the way drugs are metabolized by individuals and ethnic populations.” Due to this revelation, there is now a push to include more minorities in clinical trials. The necessity of this is at an all time high as. An example of specific medical issues effecting a specific ethnic group can be seen in the Korean genome project which “found a population-specific variant in a gene that regulates how some medications are metabolized by the body; this is essential information for dosing and for gauging the likelihood that a patient will respond to a particular therapy.” The National Institutes of Health is currently pushing forward with an effort called “All of Us” which “aims to sequence a diverse sampling of Americans across gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity and race. Being inclusive is an essential goal of this program, and participation is free so as to open the doors to anyone who wants to join.” Understanding more genomic data is essential to correctly diagnosing future medical issues and a must for minorities, who are underrepresented within these databases. -- -- Supplierty News Writer and Founder of www.suppliertynews.com with interests in small business, politics, technology and diversity Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*kzllALS6QCYYR5InhT991w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*wiH9sDaTMAz2JE5r2lGdMg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1044/0*Pm2VDkcAwpHZNJoi', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*kzllALS6QCYYR5InhT991w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*wiH9sDaTMAz2JE5r2lGdMg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*PganRNRjG3EcZprs', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*kzllALS6QCYYR5InhT991w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*byP3QrtI0p5MHL4h', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*kzllALS6QCYYR5InhT991w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*Ke5ewhKlqtfzgJsM', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*kzllALS6QCYYR5InhT991w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*YNnk8gAfc7ctQ2f3', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*kzllALS6QCYYR5InhT991w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*_wvc1IOHe1qT5s7-hNm2JQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*wzwnJD8UpPtAd2YoIPEiNQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*TcF9rICJPQZsrzNignSvgw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*TQlEMeYwwWc38Wqm7EfCTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*0-N4JrXpZG1KJfIrAutd3A.png']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@supplierty?source=post_page-----d7bbdd0063d0--------------------------------,0,2 min read
Web-based Tech Support,Written by WebserveBlogs," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in WebserveBlogs Follow -- Listen Share Why You Must Invest in Web-based Tech Support Web-based tech support is now ubiquitous and radically improving the way customers interact with businesses. It is quick, easy, time-saving and cost-effective. If you are still contemplating getting a customer care system in place that heavily inclines towards a web base, here is a little guide for you to understand the various means of going about it, the advantages and disadvantages of the system and how to avoid the latter. Web-based tech support is now ubiquitous and radically improving the way customers interact with businesses. It is quick, easy, time-saving and cost-effective. If you are still contemplating getting a customer care system in place that heavily inclines towards a web base, here is a little guide for you to understand the various means of going about it, the advantages and disadvantages of the system and how to avoid the latter. Get Thoroughly Informative Content The first and a very crucial step towards developing a robust web-based tech support system is getting precise content in place for all the answers people may be seeking. Use your own experience in the business to put together a list of the commonest queries your customers may have and get some answers ready for the same. Be it through dedicated web pages for specific issues or through a page of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), invest in content that readily resolves concerns. Look at it as an investment that lets you save countless hours in having to respond individually to each customer. Troubleshooting Forms Just like the previous step of filing FAQs, this one would need you to come up with common complain points and create troubleshooting forms based on them. Make sure they are easy to understand and ask for only as much information as is necessary towards troubleshooting an issue. Too long and complicated forms are always a major turnoff for people. Live Chats Chats are an excellent replacement for phone calls. It makes it easy for consumers to make their complaints — they can contact the customer support team from anywhere at any time in situations where they cannot get on a call. And on the other side, chat also makes it easier for troubleshooting professionals to multi-task between various customers. So it’s a win-win. Should you want to go one step ahead and install a system that is available 24*7 for your customers, a chatbot can be a good idea. Many big and mid-sized companies now have AI-based chat support for their consumers and it’s fetching them good returns on investment. The Benefits of Web Based Customer Support Call support is ridden by a massive issue of queue times for people — this holds especially true if you have a busy stream of support queries coming in every day. Many a time, wait times are so long that many people drop the call mid-way and complain about how poor the customer service of the company is. With web-based support, you can completely eliminate this problem. Customers can instantly get the static content on troubleshooting and write in to the chat support in case they need further assistance. For companies with various departments, the necessity to transfer a call from one department to another occurs often. This results in customers having to repeat the details of their problem over and over again to various executives, not to mention the frequent technical glitches involved in transferring calls. Online support helps get this straight by ensuring that the same set of information about a customer query is available to all and the customer only has to feed the information once. An extension of the last point, form or chat-based support allows for excellent record keeping of the complainant’s data. What the customer says once about the problem is saved in real time and can be accessed any time later for aiding in the troubleshooting process. On the other hand, recording phone calls and listening to them for assistance is nowhere as efficient as accessing written data. Making a call may not always be a possibility for everyone — people who are traveling internationally, for instance, may not have the required phone connection — or else they may be in a different time zone. Wi-Fi, however, is generally available and makes communicating through the Internet far easier and cheaper. So offering internet based tech support will be a boon for people on the go. The Greatest Disadvantage: Data Leak Risks Leakage of sensitive data has occurred so many times on various popular websites that people are now wary of giving in personal information on Internet forms. Making sure you have the requisite data security in place will be of considerable help here. Also, after getting the security measures, you must mention it on your form pages that you are a completely secure platform and have a strict confidentiality policy in place to safeguard users’ information. Lack of Human Touch Another small disadvantage of web-based tech support is that customers can feel alienated. Talking to a computer may not be a very desirable situation for many people, especially those in the older demographic. A nice way to maneuver around this problem is by personalizing emails and chat responses as far as possible for different consumer personas. Also, you could include support content in the local language to make it more relatable. In any case, the advantages definitely outweigh the disadvantages, and web-based tech support is unavoidable, even if you continue to keep a calling system running to aid the former.

Through Your Child’s Eyes,Written by Kristin Nersten," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Kristin Nersten Follow -- Listen Share What does your child see during the day? Hopefully your face. Maybe some toys. Possibly some outdoor scenery. A car seat, their car mirror. The inside of Target if we’re being honest. But what else? More than likely, they see a lot of your phone. It’s always handy, and I get it. You want it right on hand to be able to snap the best pictures at the most opportune times. That’s the beauty of the cameras on phones. It’s convenient and you just never know when you might see the perfect picture. But then they start to associate seeing you with seeing a phone. Where are we going to go from here? I challenge you to think about how much you’re holding onto your phone, how much your child looks at you and sees your phone, how much the phone is in front of their face instead of your face being in front of them. How many “perfect pictures” do you need of them anyway? What are you going to do with all of them? Maybe post them on Facebook, on Instagram, your VSCO if you have that type of thing. Someday you might get around to printing them, only to realize they’ve grown up so much and don’t look the same anymore so you only have one of the pictures up and then shove the rest in an envelope in a drawer. What does that mean for the rest of the thousands, yes thousands, of pictures we have? I try to leave my phone places. In the room, by the couch. I make it a point not to bring it when we go places. It scares me when I think about the fact my child could get to a point where he is more excited to see my phone than my face because it might mean I’ll be interacting with him to get a smile for a picture. All he wants is the interaction and that’s what he’ll get with the phone. I think that someday, my great-grandchildren will love to see the pictures I’ve taken. While that is undoubtably true, they aren’t going to need to see two-thousand pictures from a six month span. They’ll want to see enough to get a picture of what my little one looked like growing up, to get an overall picture of what life was like and what they were like as a child. They don’t need a play by play of every single day, of every single smile or temper tantrum. Phones are amazing and it’s great to see how you can remain connected with friends and families who live further away. But even they don’t need hour by hour updates. Even if you send multiple pictures or videos per week, it doesn’t have to be the minute something happens. Celebrate with your children and be present. And yes, capture the moments because they are great to look back on. But don’t be so bent on capturing every single moment that when you think back on these days you see it through your phone screen. Don’t be so caught up in making sure everything is documented that you don’t have any real memories. And don’t be so hung up on your phone that your children associate you with a phone. Make sure they have memories of you, too. -- -- lover of travel, parenting, pastries, coffee & reading Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*fDfmBMqGl8oIbj_L.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/0*fDfmBMqGl8oIbj_L.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*yuVzMhCJyDENbyhwAsrkwA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*fDfmBMqGl8oIbj_L.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*yuVzMhCJyDENbyhwAsrkwA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*fDfmBMqGl8oIbj_L.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*vzu3JPzaq2EZKTZNY9BhLA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*lEmL62oZdrOOWIzAAFKiFg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*i2zLIwC9mftamP1dbciCeQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*nChshyHhYer985FIUWu6TA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*maC8NLpto3tNwluhoRODsw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*uK_4iX6n75cpB04AAIyp2A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Uic88MQruy02aTYuqwVC8g.png']",2-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@kmnersten?source=post_page-----6b2a43ffb618--------------------------------,0,3 min read
Bildirim Sesleri Hayatımızı Nasıl Etkiliyor?,"Written by Moblobi,HABERİN DEVAMINI OKUMAK İÇİN BURAYA TIKLAYIN!"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Moblobi Follow -- Share Bildirim sesleri hayatımızı sandığımızdan daha fazla etkiliyor olabilir.. Günümüzde teknolojinin gelişmesi ile birlikte cep telefonu kullanma oranı da arttı. Fazla zaman geçirilen ve strese sebep olan cep telefonlarının bildirim seslerinin de stresi arttırdığı tespit edildi. Cep telefonları ya da bilgisayarlardan gelen titreşim, mesaj veya bildirim sesleri insanda sürekli bakmaya ve kontrol etmeye neden oluyor. Bilinçsizce tetikte olmamızı sağlayan bu sesler, yapılan iş üzerinde de konsantrasyonu azaltıyor. Uzmanlara göre, gelen bu bildirimlere onay verilmesini sağlayıp üretkenliği azaltarak insanların teknoloji bağımlısı olduklarını işaret ediyorlar. Araştırmalara göre bir insan ortalama 60–80 kez bildirim alıyor. California State Üniversitesi’ nden profesör Larry Rosen, teknolojik aletlerden gelen bildirim seslerinin, insanda fiziksel ve zihinsel tepkilere yol açtığını söylüyor. Rosen, bildirim sesi geldiğinde insanların kalp atışının yükseldiğini, ciltlerinde karıncalanma ve ürperti oluştuğunu ifade ediyor.

Presto Change-O Privacy Disappears!,Written by Canadian Civil Liberties Association," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Canadian Civil Liberties Association Follow -- Share By Brenda McPhail, Director of Privacy, Technology & Surveillance, CCLA January 3, 2019 December 31 is the end of an era for Torontonians. It’s the last day, ever, that we can use a metropass on the Toronto Transit system. From January 1 2019, the Presto electronic payment system takes over, and that means that our ability to travel by bus or subway through the city untracked has radically decreased. We could buy a metropass with cash, use it every day all month by showing it to a fare collector, and no record that connected us with that card would be created. Not so with Presto. Presto, now in operation in Greater Toronto, Hamilton and Ottawa transit systems, is developing a reputation as the system we love to hate. But the gripes you hear floating around about the switch from pass to Presto are focused on the fact that the Presto system is plagued with dysfunctional card readers, auto-fill errors that leave riders unexpectedly out of funds, and vending machines that are better at taking money than spitting out new cards. These are all irritating, but they’re likely to get fixed over time. The big issue that we’re not talking much about at all is privacy — when Presto becomes the only option, anonymous travel becomes pretty much impossible.

"I interviewed at six top companies in Silicon Valley in six days, and stumbled into six job offers","LinkedIn (Sunnyvale, CA),Yelp (San Francisco, CA),Apple (Cupertino, CA),Amazon (Palo Alto, CA),Facebook (Menlo Park, CA),Google (Mountain View, CA),Written by Bay Area Belletrist,Introduction & Statistics,The Companies, in order,Study Plan,Lessons Learned,Wrap-Up"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Bay Area Belletrist Follow -- 46 Listen Share In the six days* from August 13th to August 20th, 2018, I interviewed at LinkedIn, Yelp, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google and got all six job offers. Edit: follow-up post (with the $ offered) posted here! Follow my Twitter for future updates :) Levels.fyi now offers a professional negotiation service if you’re looking for help from actual recruiters (I’ve attached my affiliate link). All of the below is heavily inspired by this post from last year that originally pushed me to consider the possibility of moving companies. I didn’t want to fly across the country repeatedly to find my perfect job, so I knew I had to schedule them alongside each other and gut it out. While the roles I was specifically pursuing were mobile positions, the study approach, tips, and recommendations should be universal. Hopefully, I can inspire people that were in the same spot as me — not 100% happy with work, dreaming of life in the Bay, but lacking severely on the “study prep” front — to just go for it and see what the future brings their way. I knew I wanted a job in the Bay Area where I could really grow from a mobile perspective at a larger company. I’ve worked at startups before and I’ve loved it, but for a few reasons, I was looking at the big fish this go-around (in terms of valuation, not strictly team size). I also knew that I wasn’t positive where I wanted to work or how much compensation I’d need to match what I’m making now. I also knew I didn’t want to apply to 100+ places like I did when I was graduating from college. All told, I applied to 20 companies. I was explicitly rejected by 4 of those companies (Reddit, Nest, Stripe, Uber) after applying. Of the remaining 16, 10 companies never responded to me either way (Lyft, Airbnb, Dropbox, Instagram, YouTube, Square, Robinhood, Twitter, Snap, Slack). Math dictates 6 companies followed up with a recruiter screen. Of those 6 companies, I was able to get phone screens with 6, onsites with 6, and offers from 6. Reviewing my Google Calendar, I believe I had (approximately): Adding up the above says I had 46 interviews in 73 days (including gaps between each step). It was exhausting and it meant that most of my lunch breaks were just interviews for multiple weeks. I had to start going into work very early so I could leave earlier to take calls at home. Making sure I was still meeting all of my commitments at work was a challenge, too, but I made sure to prioritize that over interviewing, rescheduling when necessary. I wouldn’t phone it in for the purposes of interviewing. It makes you look bad, it’s unethical, and if you don’t get a job, you’re now a lower performer. LinkedIn’s mobile apps are actually pretty slick and they have some solid contributions to the open source community. I was very impressed throughout the entire interview process with LinkedIn from both a culture perspective and an engineering perspective. They rose the highest on my mental list of iOS Prestige™ from the start of the process until the end. Yelp has a really beautiful app with tons of iOS subtleties that show an understanding of the platform. I loved the vibe onsite. They have a beautiful building and I’d love to work with any of my interviewers. They’re much smaller than any of the other companies I applied to and it showed in all of the good ways. It seemed very tight knit and the process moved fast. Apple’s been an important part of iOS for a while (har har). I grew up an extreme Apple fanboy (since the age of 12, at least). The Mac originally got me into programming. The iPhone SDK encouraged me to build and ship my first app. It was absolutely surreal to have them invite me onsite and later extend me an offer. I don’t know what else there is to say on that front. I wouldn’t consider Amazon a “mobile-first” as a company (at all). This position/team, though, met the criteria I laid out to start. I wasn’t in love with the Palo Alto building I was in specifically, but it’s a temporary office until they move into a more Amazon-y building, so it’s mostly poor interview timing on that front. The people I spoke to seemed pretty dedicated to their product. Although every company loved telling me that “it really feels like a startup!”, it rang the truest at Amazon. I interviewed Facebook’s newest building. I thought it was really cool overall, although I’m somewhat hazy on the details about how the interview itself went because I was on my fifth consecutive day of interviewing with inadequate sleep. I do remember really enjoying the people I spoke with and having a very insightful lunch interview. Google, to my understanding, does pretty “generic” interviews for a given role. I spoke to a lot of members from one of Google’s biggest products on iOS, but I wasn’t interviewing for a position specifically with that team. After I passed through Google’s hiring committee I moved on to the team matching phase and ultimately matched up with a team. It’s a very loooooong process relative to the rest of the companies I spoke with, so I definitely had to keep everyone updated on where Google was. I also had to let Google know where I was with everyone else. To be clear, I was starting from a position where I could probably do most Leetcode Easy problems in ~30 minutes, and I could maybe solve 25% of Leetcode Medium problems with infinite time. Solving Leetcode Hard problems were akin to trying to solve P=NP. In short, I had a large gap to bridge. To study algorithms I began first with Cracking the Coding Interview. On Sunday mornings I’d wake up and go to a coffee shop and grind out some problems in Objective-C. Once I did enough problems in CtCI (I think I solved ~35 problems) I would review a handful of Leetcode problems in the chapters I’d gone over. After a few weeks of this, I felt I had “the basics” down and moved on to my next phase. With the basics down, I moved on to Elements of Programming Interviews. This book is considerably more difficult than CtCI. The book has recommended study plans that I stuck pretty closely with. I think there was one that planned on four weeks of studying and I got through almost all of it. It is critical, in my opinion, to either whiteboard problems with someone or mock a phone interview with someone. Not critical as in “very important”, but critical as in you should consider it an absolute requirement when studying. I’m sure you can get a job without it, but it’s the single best form of practice I had. If anyone wants to mock phone interviews for iOS I’d be happy to help out — you may be able to find me on CS Career Hackers and maybe we can work something out, time permitting. If not me, there are plenty of others there willing to help out. It’ll be awkward. That’s the point. If it were natural you wouldn’t need to practice it, would you? If you start practicing on the phone or on a whiteboard and it’s embarrassing or awkward, it’s a sign you’re doing exactly what you should be: practicing. It was pretty awkward for me until it wasn’t, and the practice absolutely paid off. After about a month of consistently practicing problems each day (maybe 2–3 hours/day, more on weekends) I moved on to doing primarily Leetcode’s “Top Interview Questions”. I didn’t do them all but I did “enough”. The key to preparing algorithm interviews is to get yourself to a point that you can figure out a problem during the interview, not necessarily to know how to do every problem. That’s impossible. Almost all of the questions I heard over my week of onsites were “new” to me yet similar to questions I’d seen. That’s how most development goes in the industry, too. You have a lot of similar problems but your particular use case has special constraints. I’m going to present a bunch of lessons I learned as bullet points in no particular order. Everything listed below is something I wish I knew beforehand, both in terms of preparation on the technical side and in terms of scheduling and other non-technical tips. These lessons are not iOS-specific and I’d imagine are generally applicable to all interviews in our industry. So that’s that! It was a crazy ride and I have no regrets. I truly, genuinely hope that the above can help someone get over the hump when it comes to landing a job they’ve dreamed about. If there’s particular interest in iOS-specific help, I can publish some tips, so please comment and let me know. If it’s of any use: I was interviewing for my second job out of college with about two and a half years of experience without any particularly notable internships or employers on my resume; I went to a very small school that had zero known software companies at their “career fair”; I started preparing in late April and started applying in June/July; and, lastly, a few months in, my job is everything I could have possibly dreamed of. I’d like to shout out the CS Career Hackers community one last time. If you’re looking for a place to practice and talk with others in similar situations (or those that have been through it on either side), please do check it out. 👍 I didn’t find it until a few months after I signed my offer, but it’s a great place nonetheless.

720 Free Online Programming & Computer Science Courses You Can Start in January,"Written by Dhawal Shah,Beginner (192),Intermediate (388),Advanced (141)"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Dhawal Shah Follow We’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/news -- Listen Share Seven years ago, universities like MIT and Stanford first opened up free online courses to the public. Today, more than 850 schools around the world have created thousands of free online courses, popularly known as Massive Open Online Courses or MOOCs. I’ve compiled this list of 720 such free online courses that you can start this month. For this, I leveraged Class Central’s database of over 11,000 courses. I’ve also included each course’s average rating. I’ve sorted these courses into the following categories based on their difficulty level: Courses that are being offered for the first time are marked as [NEW]. Many of these courses are completely self-paced. The rest will start at various times later in January. You can find complete lists of the technology-related courses starting later in 2019 on Class Central’s Computer Science, Data Science, and Programming subject pages. I understand this a long list and might be daunting for learners new to programming.

Why 2018 Was the Year of the Scam,"In society, politics, and technology, it increasingly feels like we’re being swindled. What’s going on?,Written by Colin Horgan"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Colin Horgan Follow -- 10 Share Three days after Christmas, Twitter user Kilgore Trout (with over 51,000 followers) tweeted a link to a GoFundMe fundraising page, writing, “hello I am catching the crowdfunding wave but also being extremely honest please contribute today.” The reason for the GoFundMe page? “I Am Just Taking Your Money. There Is No Reason,” the fundraising page put it. GoFundMe eventually took the page down, but not before it raised $69 (“the perfect RIP,” Trout tweeted). The page was clearly a joke, but one that resonated in the waning days of 2018, a year in which it seemed like just about everything was being exposed as a scam. Kilgore Trout’s GoFundMe, for instance, appeared only days after another fundraising attempt on the site was revealed as a $400,000 scam. In autumn 2017, a young couple from New Jersey set up a page to raise money for a man they claimed was a destitute war veteran who they said gave the woman his last $20 so she could refill her gas tank. Before the story was exposed as a complete fabrication, the couple had been featured prominently by major media outlets that attached themselves to a heartwarming viral tale. -- -- 10 writer.

How a Feel-Good AI Story Went Wrong in Flint,"A machine-learning model showed promising results, but city officials and their engineering contractor abandoned it,Written by Alexis C. Madrigal"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Alexis C. Madrigal Follow The Atlantic -- 7 Share More than a thousand days after the water problems in Flint, Michigan, became national news, thousands of homes in the city still have lead pipes, from which the toxic metal can leach into the water supply. To remedy the problem, the lead pipes need to be replaced with safer, copper ones. That sounds straightforward, but it is a challenge to figure out which homes have lead pipes in the first place. The City’s records are incomplete and inaccurate. And digging up all the pipes would be costly and time-consuming. That’s just the kind of problem that automation is supposed to help solve. So volunteer computer scientists, with some funding from Google, designed a machine-learning model to help predict which homes were likely to have lead pipes. The artificial intelligence was supposed to help the City dig only where pipes were likely to need replacement. Through 2017, the plan was working. Workers inspected 8,833 homes, and of those, 6,228 homes had their pipes replaced — a 70 percent rate of accuracy. Heading into 2018, the City signed a big, national engineering firm, AECOM, to a $5 million contract to “accelerate” the program, holding a buoyant community meeting to herald the arrival of the cavalry in Flint. Few cities have embarked on a pipe-replacement program nearly as ambitious, let alone those that have to deal with the effects of segregation, environmental racism, and the collapse of industry in the upper Midwest. In total, 18,786 families in Flint now know that their pipes are safe, because the City has either dug them up and confirmed that they’re copper or replaced them if they were made of lead or galvanized steel. “I think things have gone extremely well,” Flint Mayor Karen Weaver told me. “We’re a year ahead of schedule and under budget.” But something strange happened over the course of 2018: As more and more people had their pipes evaluated in 2018, fewer and fewer inspections were finding lead pipes. In November 2017, according to meeting notes obtained by local news outlet MLive’s Zahra Ahmad, the city’s head of public worksestimated that about 10,000 of Flint’s homes… -- -- 7 The Atlantic Host of KQED’s Forum.

Sensory Porn Is Taking Over The Internet And Corrupting Our Children,"Written by Gordy Bal,So What Is ASMR?,Why Does This Scare Me?,So What Can We Do About It?,Here are 4 things you can do to positively alter your child’s relationship with technology.,1. Choose Nature Over Screen Time.,2. Limit Blue Light Exposure When Using Devices,3. Be Present With Your Child and Technology.,4. Avoid Using Screen Time As A Reward,It’s Clear, The World As We Know It Is Changing,Ready To Continue Your Consciousness Exploration?"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Gordy Bal Follow -- 1 Listen Share “It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity.” — Albert Einstein This time of year, it feels blatantly more obvious how much time we spend with technology. It’s also a time where we reflect on the past year, and aim to make changes for the next that will improve our lives. In this age of social media, we have more platforms than ever targeting us with ads and messages. On one hand, it’s an amazing opportunity for awesome brands to get their name out to consumers who actually have the want and need for their products. But on the other hand, there are more subtle sales tactics being used to target the younger audience, that not only manipulate thoughts, but actually alter our body and brain chemistry. Scary, I know. When my 6 year old son said he wanted to watch a YouTube video that he’d seen at his friends, I was curious and obliging. After some digging, he found the one, and played it for me. My immediate reaction was confusion, followed by concern. See for yourself. When I saw this, I got a serious case of the heebie jeebies. Firstly, I’d never seen my child quite so captivated by anything (let alone someone unwrapping a toy). And secondly, I could immediately tell there was a tactic being used to cause this captivation in such a young, susceptible mind. That’s when I recalled hearing about Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response. Also known on the internet as ASMR. Which I noted coincidentally appears directly in this Youtube channels name - AWESMR kids. A channel that has over 4.9M subscribers and over 3.5 BILLION video views. “Boredom, rooted in a fundamental discomfort with the self, is one of the least tolerable mental states.” — Gabor Mate ASMR is an experience characterized by a tingling sensation on the skin that typically begins on the scalp and moves down the back of the neck and upper spine. In simpler terms, it’s a pleasurable physical reaction caused by a sound stimuli. When searched on the Google, top results include: Gentle Whispering ASMR ASMR Helping You Fall Asleep In Bed ASMR Ear Massage and Brushing Although a fairly new internet phenomena, the actual cause and effect of ASMR is nothing new. In fact, Craig Richard, PhD and author of Brain Tingles: The Secret to Triggering Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response for Improved Sleep, Stress Relief, and Head-to-Toe Euphoria, thinks it’s a genetic response that’s designed to mitigate stress hormones and help us feel relaxed. So much so, that ASMR has been coined as the “Brain Orgasm”. That made me curious — what happens when you continuously stimulate this neurological pleasure response unnaturally? In a survey led by Dr. Richard, 40% of 19,000 respondents reported that their experiences from watching ASMR had decreased or gone away overtime. The same way pornography stimulates a response in the body that would naturally be promoted by sex, ASMR stimulates a response in the body that would be naturally promoted by an experience, such as a mother soothing their child, or brushing their hair. And just like pornography, it appears that desensitization is a common result of overstimulation, killing the “Brain Orgasm” for many ASMR fans. It’s becoming seemingly more difficult to distinguish pleasure and pain. I, myself struggle with knowing that a lot of today’s wellness “trends” are so new, we have no idea what they’re actually doing to our mental and physical health. And more importantly, our children’s — especially when they are still growing and in a fundamental time of brain development. As a huge believer in the Quantified Self Movement, I’m interested in self-knowledge through self-tracking. I encourage using technology for the benefit of humanity and am a supporter of many technologies that are not only improving our mental, emotional, physical and spiritual wellbeing, but the wellbeing of the planet. And yet research is showing that there’s no way around it — screen time damages the brain, and in turn has detrimental impact on mental, emotional and physical wellbeing. “Much of the damage occurs in the brain’s frontal lobe, which undergoes massive changes from puberty until the mid-twenties. Frontal lobe development, in turn, largely determines success in every area of life — from sense of well-being to academic or career success to relationship skills.” Think back to sugar. When we were growing up, our parents unknowingly subjected us to it through unlimited cereals, cookies, soft drinks, etc. Only now is research showing the devastating impact it has on brain health, diabetes and heart disease, not to mention it’s extremely addictive nature. The equivalent will be true with screen time — in 30 years from now, research will begin to show more clearly just how damaging excess screen time is on mental, emotional and physical health. And the children who grew up glued to the screen will be disadvantaged, the same way the ones who ate unlimited sugar are. Although seemingly harmless, these addictive ASMR videos are desensitizing us from natural pleasure and altering our brain chemistry. The statistics are shocking, and yet its not surprising. Unlimited content is now at our children’s fingertips, and it’s targeting them in an extremely manipulative and addictive way. In an article titled “Youtube’s Dark Side Could Be Affecting Your Child’s Mental Health” a clear chart shows the percentage of children choosing the unknown and unlimited world Youtube over structured TV. We are moving towards a world where we have little to no control over technology and its effects on us. Not only is it being used to catch our attention, but it’s being used to alter our physical chemistry and the way we see the world. And it seems like the people with the most fear and caution around the technology we use every day are the ones who are creating it. Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are two examples of parents who limit their children’s screen time. Just this alone is reason enough to question the devices that have become an extension of our bodies and consume so much of our time. “The most important part about tomorrow is not the technology or the automation, but that man is going to come into entirely new relationships with his fellow men. He will retain much more in his everyday life of what we term the naïveté and idealism of the child. I think the way to see what tomorrow is going to look like is just to look at our children.” — R. Buckminster Fuller It’s not completely hopeless. The more awareness we have around what’s happening, the more we can control its effect on us and the people we love. Especially our children. Children are a blank canvas, yet they come into the world with a knowing far greater than we give them credit for. Very quickly, children learn what is good for them and what is harmful. They also watch and listen to us closely, and pick up on our behaviours. Have you ever said something while your child was in the room, not thinking about them being around. And then later that day they repeat that exact sentence or bring it up in another way? It’s not surprising really — Children’s brains are like sponges, ready to absorb whatever is in front of them. Making it that much more important to be conscious of what we expose them to. And in turn, not only do we avoid having to sit through painfully numbing Youtube videos, but we also reap the benefits of making better choices for their lives. “Nature cures, not the physician” — Hippocrates Too often we forget what is right in front of us. In a world where we have millions of videos at our fingertips, and a pocketful of games on our device at any second, it is easy to look past our true nature — Nature. But spending time outside is incredibly important for mental, emotional and physical wellbeing. There is even now a word that describes this innate instinct — Biophilia: The innate human need to connect with nature. And it’s not some far out idea; study after study shows that our disconnect from nature is causing an increase in anxiety and depression, as well as a slew of other physical and mental challenges. No wonder our children are experiencing mental health issues younger; we are replacing their natural instinct for connection with a stimulating screen. So it’s simple, choose nature! Next time you have an hour to spare or a week of holiday’s, choose to spend more of that time outside, connecting with your children and to nature. You may feel the cold more than your kids, but you will also experience this unbeatable joy of watching them interact in their most natural state. “Technology is, of course, a double edged sword. Fire can cook our food but also burn us.” — Jason Silva There’s no way to completely avoid exposure to technology and the internet. Even if there was, that wouldn’t be the answer. We are living in an age of exponential technology. It’s advancing faster than we can keep up with, making it that much more important to learn how to balance its effects. As our children’s exposure continues to grow, they will inevitably encounter things we wish they wouldn’t. That’s something we can learn to accept within ourselves, and trust in their values and innate knowing to guide the way. What we can do now, is protect our children’s physical and mental body, and instil healthy habits that they can grow with. I’m sure you’ve heard of blue light, and either feared it or brushed it off as nothing (no judgement either way). Here’s a simple explanation so you’re in the know. First of all, it’s everywhere — Sunlight is actually the main source of blue light (it also contains red, orange, yellow, green and every shade in between). But what we’re focused on here, is the manmade blue light coming from most of our devices. Although blue light is important in regulating our circadian rhythm, too much blue light late at night can disrupt this cycle, and cause trouble sleeping and daytime fatigue. Another key point about blue light is that our eyes are not very good at blocking it. It’s the shortest, yet highest energy wavelength, causing it to flicker more easily. This flickering leads to eye strain, headaches, mental and physical fatigue, and potential long-term loss of vision. Before the age of 10, children’s eyes are not fully developed and much more susceptible to the negative effects that come along with screen time, making it that much more important to protect them from the potentially harmful effects. Like I mentioned before, it’s too early in the game to know the exact effects, so precaution is always advised. Luckily, more and more conscious technology is coming out that can protect us and our children from these effects. So invest in blue light screen protectors for your devices or blue light glasses that your child can wear whenever they’re having screen time. Not only is this a physical layer of protection, but it becomes a conscious reminder of the time we spend on electronic devices. “This is the real secret of life — to be completely engaged with what you are doing in the here and now. And instead of calling it work, realize it is play.” — Alan Watts It’s all too easy to give our children screen time as a way to get some peace and quiet at home or on the go — I do it too. But recently, I’ve found the quiet to be more disturbing than comforting. Seeing my children numb out to endless videos on a screen is incredibly disheartening, especially after seeing the stark contrast of joy and light on their faces when they’re physically playing games or outside. Not only do I find the numbing concerning, but now with Youtube, there is no way to filter the content they’re exposed to. I was shocked when I read about malicious content being uploaded on Youtube specifically directed to children, in the form of their favourite cartoons. There are thousands of these videos being uploaded daily, receiving millions of views by children, and Youtube can’t keep up with filtering the ones with exploitive content. Yes, it’s incredibly sad that this is the reality of our world to begin with. But it’s also a harsh reminder of our need for awareness, presence and raised consciousness. When it comes to my children and my own state of mind, the answer I’ve found most useful is being present with them every day, including during screen time. Only watching videos when myself or my wife can watch too, and using this time for inquiry, exploration and curiosity. Not only does this ensure the content consumed is positive, but it brings a level of connection into an otherwise isolating activity. “If you finish all of your dinner, you can watch TV tonight”. Have you ever heard a sentence like this come out of your mouth, and then immediately wished you hadn’t or felt some sort of guilt over using this tactic to get what you want? I’m not asking this to blame or guilt — I’m raising my hand right with you. Parenting is the hardest (and most rewarding) job, and technology seems to have made it slightly easier in exhaustive situations. Part of the work I’ve done on myself has revolved around understanding why I react in certain situations and what these triggers mean as an individual and a parent. And one thing I’ve come to know, is that it’s never about my child and always about something within me. Dr. Shefali puts it beautifully: May you be blessed with a child who defies you, so you may learn to release control. Who doesn’t listen, so you may learn to tune in. Who loves to procrastinate, so you learn beauty of stillness. Who forgets things, so you learn to let go of attachments. Who is extra-sensitive, so you learn to be grounded. Who is inattentive, so you learn to be focused. Who dares to rebel, so you learn to think outside the box. Who feels afraid, so you learn to trust the Universe. May you be blessed with a child who teaches you it is never about them, and all about you. If you’d hoped I would have an answer for a reward in replace of screen time, I don’t. But I do urge you to look within and see your children as the whole, complete beings they are. Ones who innately create science experiments out of the contents of your fridge, and turn cardboard boxes into spaceships. Ones who only need love to thrive, and yearn for connection with you and the world around them. These are the future scientists and engineers and healers who will improve our planet. We can see this as a bad thing, or we can see this as the shift humanity needs to improve the future of the planet. A shift that starts with our children. “Children are one third of our population and all of our future.” Which leads me to questioning how the education system has remained the same as 100 years ago, when the world has changed so much? And why do we still put our children in a structure that was made to turn out factory workers? I dive deeper into these questions in a previous article titled This Is How We’re Failing Our Children, but it’s a conversation I want to continue having for the future of our children. A conversation that led me to one of my greatest missions yet — creating a new paradigm school called Xploration Centre. Xploration Centre is built on the principles of Love, Nature and Emerging Technology, where every child is known and cherished for who they are; where the purpose of the entire curriculum is to cultivate the genius in every child and find ways for that genius to serve and benefit the community at large. Children learn key values such as critical thinking, collaboration, curiosity and consciousness, so that they become creative problem-solvers in the world that is emerging. In this way, they aren’t enslaved by technology, rather they learn how to work synergistically alongside it. If this newfound possibility is exciting for you, reach out — I’d love to hear from you! I’ve put together a cheat sheet with 12 easy to apply consciousness hacks that will put you in a state of abundance and flow. Your children will benefit too! Get the cheat sheet here!

"The Biggest Tech Trends of 2019, According to Top Experts","Next year’s AI, AR, and 5G tech may set the stage for some massive tectonic shifts in tech and culture,Written by Fast Company,Patrick Moorhead, Principal, Moor Insights & Strategy,Peter Rojas, Partner, Betaworks Ventures"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Fast Company Follow Fast Company -- 3 Share By Mark Sullivan For the tech industry, 2019 may be more about laying groundwork than historic breakthroughs. But it should be a busy and exciting year, as key new technologies begin finding their way into real, useful applications. The smartphone will still be our central tech device by the end of next year, but as augmented reality and wearables progress, we’ll sense more and more that a new paradigm in personal computing is around the corner. That will be helped along by enabling technologies such as 5G networks, which will be stretching far and wide by the end of 2020. And, artificial intelligence will become infused in all kinds of products, allowing gadgets and services to subtly begin to anticipate our wants. These tectonic shifts are already creating opportunity and chances for innovation. Venture capital investments on startup companies are on pace to reach $100 billion in 2018, far exceeding 2017’s $82 billion in investments. The big question is which of these opportunity areas will mature in 2019. We asked venture capitalists, tech analysts, and a few entrepreneurs for their thoughts on the subject. On the growth of AI: We will see further permutations of artificial intelligence making their way into every aspect of our lives and our devices. We will see more services and experiences. Obviously the upside is that these things will become better at knowing what you want beforehand, and then doing it for you, whether that is meeting management or calling a Waymo self-driving cab or a microwave knowing exactly what you’ve put inside it and then starting when you tell it to start. This is all brought about by massive improvements in computational power and savvy programming.

Not just me, Albert Einstein believes this too 😛. 111, that’s not really my lucky number, so to say. However, this number filled me with joy and ecstasy when I saw it as my rank on the rankings page of the LeetCode contest number 111. What a coincidence! That’s the highest ranking in a weekly contest that I’ve achieved so far on the platform. The contest number and the ranking were obviously pure coincidence. The contest usually consists of an Easy problem, 2 Medium level problems, and a Hard problem. More often than not, the hard problem is something that requires a lot of algorithmic knowledge and prior practice to be able to pull off during the contest. This contest’s final problem was no exception to this. Why do I say it was very hard? Have a look at the number of people who were able to solve it during the contest. As the title of the article suggests, this problem was to be solved using Bit Masking based Dynamic Programming. Dynamic Programming is one of the most dreaded algorithmic domains out there. It requires a lot of practice to develop intuition about a dynamic programming-based solution to a problem. I’ve always considered it to be an enhancement to a recursive solution to a problem. The main idea behind dynamic programming in layperson’s terms is: Avoid repeated computations by caching the results. Bitmasking as a topic in computer programming is something that I have (and I’m sure countless of other developers out there have as well) feared for a long time. This is one of those topics that will surely take you off balance in an interview and get you a rejection. Programmers out there generally tend to avoid practicing problems related to this topic simply because it is difficult to build an intuition about it. Optimizations related to bit manipulations occur in the most unexpected of places. With some practice, I have been able to overcome the fear, so to say, of working on bitmasking-based programming problems. In this article, apart from describing the solution to the problem I’ve mentioned above, in detail, I will also go over some basics of bitmasking and some programming problems where it can come in handy. As with any new thing you learn, it’s very difficult to retain theoretical concepts related to bitmasking. Retention is the best when it comes via practice. That is the main aim of this article. Let’s quickly look at the table of contents before we kick off the main article. A bit is to the computing world what an atom is to human life. A bit is essentially the smallest unit of storage in a computer. It’s the only unit that a computer understands. The only information that a bit can store is formed from two different states: 0️⃣ and 1️⃣. Any sort of computation that a computer performs is basically some form of bit manipulation. Let’s look at a Wikipedia definition for bit manipulation: Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a word. Computer programming tasks that require bit manipulation include low-level device control, error detection and correction algorithms, data compression, encryption algorithms, and optimization. For most other tasks, modern programming languages allow the programmer to work directly with abstractions instead of bits that represent those abstractions. Implementation-wise, one of the most useful and effective low-level optimizations to an algorithm is bit manipulation. In some cases, bit manipulation can bypass looping over a data structure and give manifolds speed improvement. The only downfall to such optimizations is the code readability and maintenance. That is one scary piece of ☠code ☠ At the heart of bit manipulation are the bit-wise operators: These are the fundamental operators using which we can perform some complicated bit manipulation operations. Hence, it’s very important to brush up on these operators and their truth tables before moving onto some more interesting stuff. The truth tables show the results for these operators when they operate on 2 bits represented by A and B. The computer has to deal with much more than just one bit of data. The data processed by the system is generally in bytes or kilobytes or more. How do these operators work on operands represented by for e.g. 8-bits or 16-bits? In such a scenario, the operations are the same, except that they operate on each bit of the arguments. Let’s consider a simple example to clarify this. In addition to these 4 basic operators, there are two other set of bitwise operators that do come in very handy. Almost all the problems that we will look at in this article will be making use of them to give a huge boost in computational speed. These are the left shift << and the right shift >> operators. Simply speaking, the left shift operator means multiplying a number by 2 and the right shift operator means dividing a number by 2. Let’s look at a simple animation to show why these operators are called left shift and right shift respectively. For demonstrating the left shift operation, we start off with the decimal number 1 and then repeatedly multiply it with 2. As you can see in the binary representation of the resulting numbers, the only 1 in the representation keeps on shifting left one step at a time. That’s why it’s called the left shift operation. Along the same lines, for demonstrating the right shift operation, we start off with the decimal number 128and then repeatedly divide it by 2. As you can see in the binary representation of the resulting numbers, the only 1 in the representation keeps on shifting right one step at a time. That’s why it’s called the right shift operation. Now that we are all versed with the basic binary operators, let’s move on to some simple use cases for these operators. We will look at a few examples below. These are not programming problems by themselves, however, they are used a lot as building blocks in a lot of algorithms. One of the basic utilities for the operators we looked at above is to count the number of bits, set in a given binary representation. This might not seem an important use case right now, but we will be getting into more details later on and then it will start to seem more meaningful. For now, let’s just count the number of set bits as efficiently as possible. The first method that we will look at for this, is a bit intuitive. It makes use of the bitwise AND operator. Starting from the least significant bit, we simply check if the bit at each position is set or not and increment a counter accordingly. The AND operator returns True iff both the bits are True. Let’s look at the code for this. Yet another way of doing this is by ANDing the number with itself-1 until the number becomes zero. The number of steps taken to reach 0 will be the number of set bits in the original number. The reason this works is that every time we AND the number with itself-1, one bit gets removed from the number. This goes on until the number becomes zero. Suppose we want to mask a specific bit in a binary representation. This simply means turning off the bit or transforming a 1 → 0 . On similar lines, unmasking simply means the reverse operation on a specific bit. You might be wondering why this is useful at all. One of the most important use cases for masking (or unmasking) a bit is in set related operations. We can represent a set of items as an X-bit integer, Xis the number of items in the set. Masking a bit would mean the removal of that item from the set. For a practical application of this, be patient and read on 😛. XOR is a very versatile operator and it is perfect for the task of masking and unmasking operations. XOR outputs 1 when both the bits are opposite and a 0 when both the bits are the same. Essentially, we can make use of the same masking variable for achieving the set / un-set operation corresponding to a particular bit (the integer in the ? is being called the masking variable). The above operation will lead to masking the bit at index i if originally that bit was set in A and the same operation will lead to unmasking the bit at index i if originally it was unset in A. We have already seen how to detect if a bit is set or not when we looked at ways to count the number of set bits in a given binary representation. An important thing to note here is the index. Usually, for data structures in high-level programming languages, whenever we refer to a specific index, we mean the index of a particular element in that data-structure starting from the left end. What we are referring to an index above is from the right end (the least significant bit in the binary representation has the index 0). That’s more than enough of the basics for now. Let’s get to some actual programming problems. This will help solidify what we’ve learned so far in the article and also help build up an intuition for solving problems using bit manipulation in general. There are multiple ways of solving this problem. We can sort the given list of numbers and then iterate from 0..n and easily find the missing number. This will give us a O(NlogN) solution. Another way of solving this problem is by making use of a dictionary. We simply add all the elements in our list to a dictionary and then we can simply search for the missing number. This is a linear time solution but it makes use of additional space. Let’s look at how we can achieve a O(1) space, O(N) time solution like a boss 😎 by using bit manipulation. We will make use the XOR property here to solve this problem. As mentioned before, XOR evaluates to True when the input bits are different and it evaluates to False when presented with the same bits. We are interested in the later scenario. What do you think the following evaluates to? XORing a number with itself gives us 0. That’s the main idea behind our approach here. So, what we will do is, we will XOR all the numbers in our list. Let’s call the value we get after this as A . We will XOR all the numbers from 0..n together. Let’s call this value, B. By doing this, all the numbers present in the original array will get XORed to their counterparts and will evaluate to 0. The only number left in the end will be the missing number. This is one of those problems where writing down the answer for various test cases and observing the results for patterns really helps. So, we will do exactly that and use the pattern we find to directly arrive at the final algorithm. Let’s look at the number of 1’s in the binary representation of the first 16 numbers. The pattern being formed above is the following: An even number, E, has the same number of bits as that of E / 2An odd number, O, has one more bit than that of O / 2 That’s all there is to see in the results above. This is the algorithm in its entirety. All we have to do is to iterate on numbers from 0..n and use the two rules above and we solved the problem like a boss 😎. If you paid attention to the core idea of dynamic programming discussed during the beginning of the article, you’d know that this here, in essence, is a dynamic programming problem. We make use of the result for a previous subproblem (smaller number) to calculate the answer (number of set bits) for the current subproblem. On the face of it, we don’t need any bit manipulation as such to solve this problem. It can be solved by simple if-else clauses and a for loop. So, this is not really a bitmasking + dynamic programming kind of problem. Let’s look at a simple solution based on the ideas above. This is a perfectly good way to solve this problem. For every index, i, we check the number of bits in the number i / 2 and also add 1 if the current number is odd. We can, however, solve it in a geekier way, so to say using bit manipulation. The two operations being performed are: We have already seen the use of the right shift operator, >>, for division by 2. As for the second operation, we can simply check if the least significant is set or not. If you notice, all the odd numbers have their least significant bit set. While the even numbers don’t. We have already seen how to check if a particular bit is set or not using the AND operator. Let’s see a geekier 🤓 version of the above code. If you look at the runtimes for both the programs, they’re almost the same. A major chunk of the time is consumed by the construction of the output array. Bitwise operations are always optimized and are faster than other higher level programming constructs. There’s good news and bad news. The good news is that a slightly optimized version of the brute force algorithm will get your code accepted on the platform. The brute force way is to check all the pairs of words and for each pair, check if there are any common characters between them. For all such pairs that don’t have any common characters, record the maximum value of len(word1) * len(word2). The bad news is that this algorithm is extremely slow. Let’s look at the percentage of solutions on LeetCode which this brute force algorithm is able to beat. Shame on you, Sachin! That’s not the kind of stats you want to see for your submission. If you’re someone who simply wants to solve a problem, then your job here is done. Nothing more to do. But, if you’re like me and if you want to make this dog stop 😅, then read on! Let’s look at the time complexity for this brute force algorithm before moving onto a much more optimized solution using bit manipulation. We consider all possible pairs of words from the given array. Considering there are N words in the given array, we will get O(N²) complexity right off the bat. Other than that, we have a dictionary containing sets of characters for each of the words in the dictionary. Considering the size of the alphabet to be 26 (lowercase alphabets only), each set can potentially be of size 26. For each pair of words, we perform a set intersection to check whether the two words have any common characters or not. Set intersection takes linear time and hence, the overall complexity for this algorithm would come out to be O(26N²) which is essentially O(N²). It turns out that we can’t get rid of the part where we have to consider each pair of words from the given array. So, we can’t get rid of the O(N²) part of the algorithm. The portion that we can get rid of, however, is the part where we compare two words and see if they have any common characters. That constant 26 slows down the algorithm a lot. An important thing to note here is that the question simply cares about common characters and not their frequency or their order. What if we simply use a bitmask to represent the characters in a word? What we can do here is to have a bitmask consisting of 26 bits to represents the characters belonging to a particular word. Let’s look at such a representation for a few words to make things clearer. Hope the above figure makes it clear what we mean by a bitmask representing a corresponding word. Once we have these bitmasks for all the words, all that remains now is to check if two words have any common characters or not. If two words would have any common characters, then the corresponding bits for those characters would be set in the bitmasks for both the words. Hence, all we have to do is to do a bitwise AND of the bitmasks representing two words and check if we get a 0 or not. If we do end up getting a 0, that would imply no intersection and that is precisely what we are looking for. Let’s look at the code for this modification in the algorithm we just discussed. Bitwise operations are super quick. Let’s look at the performance of this algorithm on the LeetCode platform to corroborate the quickness of bit manipulation. Not bad, right? We improved the runtime for our program from 1820 ms earlier to 712 ms now. That’s a huge improvement, isn’t it? It turns out, we can improve this algorithm even further. The improvement can be made because of the fact that two different words can have the same bitmask. For e.g. hello and llohhel both would have the same bitmask. We can store the longest word for a given bitmask since all we care about is maximizing the product of word lengths. Let’s look at the code after incorporating this improvement. By doing this very optimization, the runtime comes down to 208ms 🎉🎉🎉 We introduced an idea in the previous problem which will be crucial in the next two problems that we will discuss. Essentially, we used the idea of bitmasking to represent elements belonging to a set. In the previous article, we considered a set of 26 alphabets and we resented that by using a bitmask containing 26 bits. A 0 at a particular index in the mask would represent set exclusion whereas a 1 would represent set inclusion. This idea is very crucial for dynamic programming problems that deal with subproblems involving a subset of numbers. We can’t really cache a subset of numbers. A set is not a hashable data structure. What do we do in such a scenario? This is where we have bitmasks come in. They are memory-efficient ways of representing subsets of elements. Let’s have a look at how we can represent the subsets above using bitmasks. Depending upon the problem’s constraints, we can make use of a bitmask. For e.g. in the previous problem, the alphabet set was limited to the size 26. A lot of programming problems that have small array sizes and involve dynamic programming that require you to hash subsets, usually are an indication of bitmasking-based approach. A 26-bit mask, e.g. in the previous problem, is essentially an integer and we can simply cache that integer in a dictionary. This saves on the memory footprint of the algorithm and greatly cuts down on the time complexity for the algorithm since bit manipulation is very efficient. We can easily include and exclude elements from the subset by masking and unmasking corresponding bits from the mask. Let’s look at another problem based on this idea before we finally discuss the star problem of this article. This is just one of those questions that begs you to use bitmasking. Notice the size of the array. It’s just 16 elements. If we consider a bitmask to represent the elements in an array, we’d have a 16-bit integer at our hands. That means, to represent all the possible subsets of a given array, we’d have 2¹⁶ possible integers. We don’t really need actual subsets. All we need is a bitmask telling us the elements belonging to that subset. Based on this idea, let’s look at dynamic programming-based approach to solve the above problem. The problem statement only asks us if a k-equal-sum partitioning is possible or not. It doesn’t ask us to return the actual partitioning. That makes the problem a whole lot simpler. We don’t care which partition an element belongs to as long as the overall sum of a partition is what total_sum / k. As we’ve mentioned in the above paragraphs, we will be using a bitmask to represent the elements of the array. We will use the individual bit states of the mask to identify which numbers have already been assigned a partition and which ones still remain to be assigned one. We can only assign a number to a partition if after adding it to that partition, the total sum remains <= total_sum / k . If the sum, S, of all the elements of the array is divisible by k, we have to complete k — 1 partitions since the last partition will automatically fall into place. In case the total sum is not divisible by k , then such an equal sum partitioning is not possible. Before looking at the code for this problem based on the ideas we’ve discussed above, it’s important to understand how dynamic programming fits into the picture. We’ve already seen why bitmasking would come in handy. But where exactly does dynamic programming fit in? Recursion is a natural fit for the problem since we have got a set of N elements and we need to partition them into k different subsets all of which have an equal sum. Since we don’t really know what partition a number should belong to, we have to try out all the options. That means, for a given partition, we try adding all available numbers recursively (within the constraints of the partition sum) and see which choice leads us to an answer. The recursion would be based on the following three variables: As we all know, for any problem to be classified as a dynamic programming problem, it should have the following two properties: Let’s look at the recursion tree for this problem to understand if we have any overlapping subproblems. We already have the first property satisfied. In the above recursion tree, we consider K = 2. That means we need 2 partitions each of sum 18. Since we never reach 18 in the tree above, the K never gets reduced. This is just a part of the recursion tree and the complete version. We can clearly see two recursion states getting repeated. We get the same mask 0011 twice. We can simply store the result once and then re-use it later on. Now let’s look at the code for based on bitmasking + dynamic programming. Now we are finally ready to look at the main problem of this article. The problem that is not as straightforward in its bitmasking application as the current one and the previous one. What do you think the simplest way of forming a superstring is? You simply take any permutation of the given words and all of these permutations will be valid superstrings. However, the question doesn’t ask us to form any superstring. It asks us to form the shortest superstring covering all the words. For this problem, we will explore the idea of chaining words together. Intuitively, you can consider the idea of chaining as set union. Let’s consider two different set of elements and then look at the combined set containing all their elements together i.e. the union set. As we can see above, whenever we do a union over two sets, the common elements only appear once. We will adopt a similar idea with chaining two words together. Essentially, when chaining words A and B together, we will only consider the common portion between the suffix of A and prefix of B exactly once. Let’s look at the diagrammatic representation for chaining of two words. This is an important concept that will come in handy for solving this problem. So as to avoid repeated computations of finding out the common portion between two words which are being chained together, we will do some preprocessing. We will find out the length of the suffix of A that overlaps with the prefix of B where A and B are being chained together. We will do this for all the pairs of words in our given list. In Python, given a string S, we can make use of S[i:] to obtain all the suffixes and S[:i] to obtain all the prefixes. We make use of this for our preprocessing below. Now that the idea of chaining is clear, we can move onto the next part of the problem where we explain why this problem can be solved recursively. Now that we are familiar with the concept of chaining, we know that whenever we chain two words together, the new word formed can be shorter than the combined lengths of the two original words. Extending this idea to all the words in the given list, we have to form a superstring that will be formed by chaining one word after the other until we are done with all the words. The important question here is, in what order should the words be chained together? For the three words aabc , hjaa, and chuj the chaining order hjaa → aabc → chuj = hjaabchuj is better than aabc → hjaa → chuj = aabchjaachuj since the former gives a superstring of length 9 as opposed to 12 in the latter order. So, the chaining order determines the overall length of the formed superstring. We will be trying out all possible arrangements for the superstrings using the given list of words and choosing the shortest one. Instead of relying on a recursion tree for explaining the need for dynamic programming, we will look at an example that will explain the same idea. Suppose we are given a set of 5 words [A, B, C, D, E] and we are to form the shortest superstring that contains all the words. We already know that we are solving this problem recursively. Suppose in the middle of our recursion, we are already done deciding the chaining order of the first 3 words. Let’s say this ordering was B → A → C . Now, we need to find out the best way to chain D and E after C so that the overall superstring length is minimized. Let’s say that in our recursion we found that C → E → D was the best chaining order. We don’t know yet if the superstring formed via B → A → C → E → D is the shortest one. However, we know that C → E → D is the best chaining order for the three words C, D, and E . Suppose now we arranged the first three words a little differently in our recursion (a separate recursion path) and now we have A → B → C and we have to recurse again to find out the best possible arrangement for E and D . However, we already know from above the best possible arrangement is C → E → D . Why calculate this again? This is where dynamic programming comes into the picture. That’s it? Go on. Explain some more. Nah, let’s now look at the the Python code bringing all these ideas together. Uh oh! Where the heck is bitmasking in all this? Let’s rephrase the problem in a slightly different manner that will make the requirement for bitmasking very clear. Given a set of N elements, we need to find a suitable arrangement for them that will minimize a certain metric. Since we are relying on dynamic programming, we will be caching results for subproblems. Our subproblems will be represented by the subset of these N items. As we’ve seen in this article and especially in the previous two problems, it’s difficult to cache subsets as it is. In case the problem constraints are small, we can represent the elements of the list using a bitmask and use that for caching purposes. After all, a bitmask is just a number. Let’s finally get to the code for finding the shortest superstring given a set of N words. All this is fine and dandy, but wasn’t the original question asking for the superstring itself and not just the length of the shortest superstring? Am I shying away from solving the entire problem? Of course not! The function recurse simply returns the length of the shortest superstring and not the superstring itself. The problem statement, however, asks us to find out the shortest superstring. If you look at the code carefully, you’ll notice a parent dictionary. At every step in our recursion, we have multiple options of words which can be chained to the current superstring (thus extending it). We use the parent dictionary to store the word at each step that gave the best answer (shortest length). For a given mask — which tells us which words have already been chained together — and a given previous word (prev_i), the parent dictionary stores the next word that in the superstring that gives the optimal answer. We will use this dictionary to backtrack and form the shortest superstring. In the end, that’s one of the best sights for a competitive programmer, especially if it’s for a hard problem in a timed competition.

Follow MESCIUS inc. -- 2 Listen Share Angular is a great platform for building responsive, universal Single Page Applications. All the stable releases of Angular are production ready and deployed by a large number of enterprises and users everywhere. Here, we’ll shift our focus towards the security aspects of Angular. Web development isn’t about writing code that works, it’s also about writing code that’s foolproof and not prone to vulnerabilities. A number of common vulnerabilities for different web applications are regularly brought to light. Vulnerabilities can seep in through obsolete dependencies, bad coding practices, or irregularities in patching updates. In this article, we’ll discuss vulnerabilities that can occur with Angular application(s) and the best ways to circumvent these vulnerabilities. The Angular team is publishing releases at frequent intervals for different feature developments, bug and vulnerability fixes, security patches, etc. Software development teams are strongly suggested to keep their Angular libraries updated constantly to stay in sync with the latest available developments. If not, malicious users may be able to attack the application that is using known security vulnerabilities associated with older versions of the software. With the sheer number of third-party library components available today, it can be a difficult task to develop applications without the use of these libraries. Libraries sometimes can have publicized vulnerabilities that can be maliciously used by attackers to input harmful data or code into applications. Some of the well-known vulnerabilities include CSRF, buffer overflows, XSS, etc. To verify that your dependencies and components are free some of the common loopholes and exploits, you can use open source vulnerability management tools. Here is a list of things that you can do to ensure that your code is secure. XSS allows malicious users to input client-side scripts into web pages that are accessed by regular users. This code can inflict considerable damage. For example, it’s possible to steal user data or undertake actions that impersonate the user with the intention to cause harm. You can read more about XSS on the OWASP website. In order to systematically and effectively block XSS bugs, Angular assumes each value as an untrusted value by default. Therefore, when a value is entered into the DOM using a template via a property, style, attribute, interpolation or class binding, Angular automatically sanitizes the value and disallows untrusted values. Here is a sample declaration in the BrowserModule: The idea behind the DomSanitizer is to sanitize the input and to clean up user-submitted data. Here is an example of the of what the skeleton of the class might look like: As you would have noticed, there are two distinct patterns. There first is the sanitize method. This identifies the ‘context’ as well as the ‘untrusted value’ and returns a trusted value. The second method uses the ‘bypassSecurityTrustX’ method which captures the ‘untrusted value.’ This is based on value usage and returns the trusted object. In the event that a value is trusted for a particular context, the sanitize method will expose the safe value within it and utilize it directly. If not, the value will eventually be sanitized to be rendered safe based on the security context. Three main functions exist for sanitizing values: In certain situations where it might be required to disable sanitization, users are able to work around security using a constructed value via one of bypassSecurityTrustX methods. They can bind this to the value from the relevant template. Here is an example: If you’re going to implement authentication in Angular, the best bet is to use a JWT-based authentication system. As a matter of fact, using JSON Web Tokens is the best choice if you’re implementing an authentication system in any Single Page Application (SPA). In a nutshell, JWTs are digitally signed JSON payloads, encoded in a URL-friendly string format. The payload contained in a token defines a user session. This could mean that it contains details unique to the user like userId or emailId. In order to confirm that the token is valid, the server needs to validate the token. What this means is, the server doesn’t have to contact the database to validate the token. The token gets invalidated when it expires, and the expiry time is defined when you create the token. For more information specific to Angular, reference this article on Angular-University.io CSP or Content Security Policy is an additional security layer that assists in detecting and inhibiting specific types of attacks including XSS and data injection. Such attacks have a goal of data theft to the distribution of malware to website defacement. To enable CSP, you would need to configure your web server to return the correct Content-Security-Policy HTTP header. You can find detailed steps to enable CSP on the MDN website. Angular templates are theoretically executable and therefore the HTML tags, binding expressions, and attributes in templates are trusted to be safe. An attacker may be able to perform something malicious if they’re able to parse an unintended value into the template. To prevent such breaches, users can utilize offline template compilers. This process is also known as template injection. In case you use Angular CLI, you can easily enable AOT: Unfortunately, the built-in browser DOM APIs do not automatically secure the application from security vulnerabilities. As an example, ‘document’ — the node that is available through ‘ElementRef’ might contain unsafe methods. Users should avoid interacting with the DOM through direct means and use Angular templates wherever available. The data validation on the client-side is usually for cosmetic purposes. Someone can try to make direct API calls to the backend with the intention of breaking something. All data on the server-side code needs to be validated and should escape appropriately to inhibit server XSS vulnerabilities. This is largely because injecting template code in an Angular application is similar to injecting executable code directly into the application. It is recommended that Angular templates on the server-side not be generated using a template language. Angular comes with built-in support that can help prevent a couple of common HTTP vulnerabilities — Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF or XSRF). Both of these vulnerabilities have to be inhibited mainly on the server side. However, Angular also assists helpers to make integration on the client side simpler. XSSI, also known as a JSON vulnerability, enables an attacker’s website to access data using a JSON API. Such attacks work on older browsers by including an API URL via a <script> tag after overriding native JavaScript object constructors. Servers can fend off such attacks by using a prefix on all JSON responses and render them non-executable using the string “)]}’,\n”. The AngularHttpClient library is able to read and strip the string “)]}’,\n” from each response prior to parsing further. XSRF, also known as ‘one-click attack’ or ‘session riding’, is a website violation where unauthorized commands are sent from a web application that is trusted by a user. In usual anti-XSRF methods, application servers transmit a random authentication token via a cookie. The receiving code reads the cookie and includes a custom request header in the token for each following request. The server then makes a comparison between the received cookie value and the request header value and rejects the request in case the values are missing or are a mismatch. The reason this method is effective is because all browsers use the same origin policy. Only the code from the originating website can read the cookies from the site and include custom headers on request. Therefore, only a trusted user application can read the cookie and add a customized header. We’ve covered all the security details that you need to be aware of while building components in Angular. It’s important to take security seriously (it shouldn’t be just limited to front-end). What are your thoughts on Angular security?

Most In-Demand IT Jobs of 2019–2020,"Written by Skywell Software,DDI Recommended Reading:"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Skywell Software Follow DataDrivenInvestor -- 1 Listen Share A s a result of digital transformations that many businesses are going through in today’s IT landscape, the jobs that will be in demand will start changing by 2020 and will be more oriented towards more high tech technologies such as AR/VR, AI, and the IoT. The demand for qualified workers to fill these positions is growing as well, which includes commonly found vacancies such as back-end and front-end developer, but there are also some less known ones as well. Let’s take a look at some of the most in-demand IT jobs of 2019–2020. This is one of the best tech jobs in 2019 because the demand for computer vision engineers has grown at a steady rate over the past five years. Their primary responsibilities include creating and fine-tuning both computer vision and ML algorithms so that they can locate, identify and classify objects. Also, since AR/VR has also grown in popularity and is expected to be a $215 billion-dollar business by 2021, the need for computer vision engineer will also increase because it is directly on Ted with AR and VR. 2. ML Engineer The ML (Machine Learning) engineers create AI systems and machines that are capable of learning and applying what they learned. They conduct advanced programming while working with convoluted datasets and algorithms to train their AI creations. What makes this one of the best technology jobs is that we see pretty much every IT company out there transforming into an AI company, therefore requiring a huge number of investments and making ML engineers a very in demand and popular profession next year and beyond. DDI Editor’s Pick — Machine Learning by Stanford 3. App Developer App developer made our list of top IT jobs because it sits at the crossroads of where technical capacity meets business needs. This role does not simply imply coding. We mentioned the popularity of AR and VR earlier and the demand for AR/VR software developers will also increase. There have been many AR-based games released in 2018 and as well as many other uses of AR and VR and these technologies will be heavily used in 2019. 4. Network Analyst As the IoT becomes mainstream and makes its way into the workplace, there will be a lot more things that will require connectivity in an efficient and easy to use manner, which serves as wind in the sails tech professions such as Network Analyst. They will need to find a way to combine their set of technical skills to produce real-time trending information regarding network traffic and their impact on the company as a whole. Therefore, network analysts will be required to know much more than how sensors work. Future network analysts must possess a thorough grasp of how the entire company operates as well as sound knowledge in AI. These new requirements make this a completely different role than most people are used to. 5. Security Analyst As the number of cyber attacks increases every year and each leak of information is costing companies millions of dollars, one of the jobs trends that is very popular right now and will be in the future, is hiring more and more security analysts. The cyber attacks that we are seeing both in the public and private sector are getting more and more advanced, which means that governments and private companies need to be one step ahead all the time. In 2019, companies will be more proactive in terms of taking on security threats head-on, which means that security analysts will need additional AI and data skills. 6. Business Intelligence Analyst It is helpful to think of the BI analyst as a counterpart to the mobile app developer. The business analyst tackles all of the issues concerning the business side of products, taking into account the company’s need in terms of apps to make a process work. It is the job of the business intelligence analyst to collect all necessary data from a wide variety of sources to draw a comprehensive picture of the company’s positioning in the industry and provide recommendations on how to cut costs and achieve growth. 7. DevOps Lead As you start hiring software developers, testers, and BI analysts, you will need to make sure that you have enough DevOps talent on your team in order to coordinate the work between all of these separate groups. The project management skills that they bring to the table are simply indispensable, which go beyond software development. All companies out there want to organize their operations in the most efficient way possible in order to avoid wasting resources and DevOps is a driving factor in delivering software faster with greater efficiency. 8. Database Administrator As companies provide a greater offering of AI-based software, the demand for database administrators will increase since companies will need to be able to maintain databases in a quality manner to make their products work efficiently. 9. Cloud Engineer An increasing amount of companies are moving their vital systems to the cloud and there are opting for a hybrid approach with many vendors. Cloud engineers will need to come up with scalable solutions and combine both in-house technologies with outside systems. 10. User Support Specialist The technology is becoming increasingly integrated into our daily lives, we will need the help of support specialists more often, which makes this one of the biggest computer jobs in demand. What many people forget is that software development does not end after the release. You still must monitor the performance of the product and provide support to users who are getting adjusted to your product. What jobs will be in demand in 2020? It is difficult to provide a definite list, but we extrapolate the trends that we are seeing on the market today, then the ten jobs mentioned above will definitely be in demand. The jobs of the future in 2020 will be much different from the ones that we are seeing today. Even if the job title will be the same, the job description, skillset, and knowledge needed for performing these jobs will be at the highest level possible.

The Mythical 10X Programmer,Written by Kyle Coberly," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Kyle Coberly Follow -- Listen Share Over 40 years ago, Fred Books published a book called “The Mythical Man-Month.” It was a collection of essays around the thesis that adding resources to a late project makes it later. One of the essays in the book, “The Surgical Team,” describes a way of structuring a team around one super-genius that everyone else helps do their important genius work. It’s a largely insane essay from an ancient era of computing (the ideal “surgical team” has two secretaries and a clerk to input all the code the super-genius wrote on paper onto punch cards). The relevant paragraph from the book: Programming managers have long recognized wide productivity variations between good programmers and poor ones. But the actual measured magnitudes have astounded all of us. In one of their studies, Sackman, Erikson, and Grant were measuring perfor- mances of a group of experienced programmers. Within just this group the ratios between best and worst performances averaged about 10:1 on productivity measurements and an amazing 5:1 on program speed and space measurements! In short the $20,000/year programmer may well be 10 times as productive as the $10,000/year one. The converse may be true, too. The data showed no correlation whatsoever between experience and per- formance. (I doubt if that is universally true.) If you’ve managed programmers at any point after 1975, you may be wondering how on earth you would measure the performance of a programmer in a scientific study. It turns out that in 1968, they: …found that the ratio of initial coding time between the best and worst programmers was about 20 to 1; the ratio of debugging times over 25 to 1; of program size 5 to 1; and of program execution speed about 10 to 1. A few things stand out about this. To create directly comparable results, they used the exact same kind of horseshit Hacker Rank challenges that are near-universally accepted as having little to do with real-world development ability. The study says nothing about maintainability (where code spends most of its life), nor does it measure the kind of skills teams need in the modern era: Communication, adaptability, and collaboration. Lastly, the tools available to develop, debug, and run software (interactive debuggers, automated testing, JIT compilers, etc.) may well have obviated the “10X” advantage a number-cruncher programmer would have had in 1968. Modern software developers are not interchangeable widgets that can be directly measured or compared. You bring your background, your specialties, your domain knowledge, your biases, and all of who you are to real-life software problems, and that’s awesome. So why, 40 years later, does the myth persist? I posit a few reasons: Some people are wrong on the internet. So? This is dangerous for a few reasons. The biggest is that the dopamine and testosterone-infused “I’m better than you at everything” implicit in this 10X myth is hardly welcoming to anyone new to the industry, much less women, people of color, or anyone’s who’s already unsure if they belong. Someone who believes themselves to be a 10Xer is also an instant team liability. Such an inflated sense of worth is hardly conducive to sincere self-reflection, growth, or being willing to make and admit mistakes. Also, who wants to work with some asshole who thinks he or she (although honestly, probably he) is 10 times better than you? Here’s a thought-experiment: Let’s say you can measure individual productivity. You’re on a team of seven, and everyone contributes “1”, so your team’s output is “7”. Now let’s say one of them is a 10Xer, so if everyone else’s output stays the same and the 10Xer contributes no tech-debt (quite the thought experiment indeed), your output is now “16”. There’s some risk to this though- 10Xers expect 10X money, and are self-described as almost impossibly rare. Someone throws a little more cash at your 10Xer, they leave, and now your team’s output is “6,” with a difficult hunt for a replacement ahead of you. How else might we get to “16""? You’d get a little more than “16” if everyone on the team brought out 15% more out of everyone else (1.15⁶ * 7≈ 16.19). This is the synergy effect. Not only is that far more realistic, it’s also more robust (losing a person knocks you to “12.6""). The upside is huge too- if the 10Xer picks up another X (which, again, is the supposed entire output of another developer), the team’s output goes to “17”- a little less than the gain if the 15% team makes each other 1% better. Teams that consistently produce great results are not comprised of solo super-geniuses who have a bunch of secretaries and clerks doing the unglamorous work while they ponder the good and the true, and I’m not sure that was ever the case.

He scored a job in a pizza shop, but found himself missing the girlfriend he had left back home. As a Valentine’s gift, he wrote a song in his bedroom for her, wistfully crooning against upbeat synthesisers. He uploaded the song, called “Me Rehúso”, to YouTube and Spotify. It began creeping up Spotify’s viral charts in Colombia, Chile and Peru, which caught the attention of Spotify’s curators — the employees who monitor minute-by-minute listening data. They unanimously agreed to add it to their playlists, such as “Verano Forever”, where Spotify’s users lapped it up. Week by week, Spotify added it to more playlists, each with bigger followings, until two months later the song made it to the holy grail — “¡Viva Latino!” — which has the clout to catapult unknown acts into stardom.

Logic Theory — Truth Tables,"Part III — Intro to the Interdisciplinary Logic Tool,Written by Jesus Najera,Introduction to Truth Tables"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Jesus Najera Follow Towards Data Science -- 1 Share Now equipped with the principles of logic theory as well as basic notation, it’s time to explore the concept of equivalency in logic. Specifically, what makes two compound premises equal? Two compound premises X & Y are logically equivalent if, for each assignment of truth values to the primitive premises which make up X & Y, the statements X & Y have identical truth values. That’s a tricky definition to swallow, but it’s the application of this definition that we care about learning. In order to achieve this, we’ll walk through multiple, increasingly-complicated examples. First though, let’s take a detour to learn a bit more about our Excalibur for this journey — one of the most simple, yet powerful tools for logicians to prove logical equivalence: truth tables. A truth table is a visual tool, in the form of a diagram with rows & columns, that shows the truth or falsity of a compound premise. It’s a way of organizing information to list out all possible scenarios from the provided premises. Let’s start with the most simple example, a truth table depicting a single premise manipulation: a negation (~) of a primitive premise (P) -- -- 1 Towards Data Science Owner @ SetDesign, NightKnight & CryptoSpace | Product Designer | Hobbyist Mathematician | VR Developer | MS in Finance @ UF Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/2*odadrbeYJRmn-fjMZHeOZA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*CJe3891yB1A1mzMdqemkdg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:6408/1*E8PQl94gbIKjdERaqXwKow.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/2*odadrbeYJRmn-fjMZHeOZA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*CJe3891yB1A1mzMdqemkdg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*UhYjNauACw0j_SP96plTRQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*odadrbeYJRmn-fjMZHeOZA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*hZoX1Q_rp9FyYwPJ4FlaUg@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*TTIl4oynrJyfIkLbC6fumA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*I7hSQEbAX39HswwARzgQVA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*blT0wi3FBRI4UTOl09XMWw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*T2QVbByXWL1Qitnjkh-pLQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*odadrbeYJRmn-fjMZHeOZA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*TQlEMeYwwWc38Wqm7EfCTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*0-N4JrXpZG1KJfIrAutd3A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/0*r4yjMpEmqzHCUvWC.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*bv2KUVNLi2sFNjBTdoBmWw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/0*zsngbTOmFCy6sUCx.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*gzCeWxDtGmD23QR5', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*di4WDrnS1F6_p9GWnxvPmg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PzJLbFrFtNkqPsxielO8zA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zPtGTCNOwu1p3kzn_sZFVQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*kQIvhDkl0ixPpv4z', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*ERYx0IB1pN-5ZX98cKAoUw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*nChshyHhYer985FIUWu6TA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*maC8NLpto3tNwluhoRODsw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg']",3-Jan-19,https://medium.comhttps://setzeus.medium.com/?source=post_page-----de313f78a16a--------------------------------,254,5 min read
A 3 step guide to assess any business use-case of AI,"This story is published in The Startup, Medium’s largest entrepreneurship publication followed by +406,714 people.,Subscribe to receive our top stories here.,Written by Uday Marepalli,Understand All Things Data,Track the State of the Art,Talk to a Quant Colleague"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Uday Marepalli Follow The Startup -- 2 Listen Share If anyone asks me what I learnt by starting off my career working in a venture capital firm, my first reply would be to mention that it was the unique pleasure of being a generalist in a world that expects recent college graduates to work on specific areas. On deeper thought, it is the only industry which gives you a chance to evaluate ideas and trends. I refer to it as ‘opportunity spotting’. Or a perch to look at what the future holds. When every entrepreneur you meet and every report you study speaks about AI, you tend to keep a close tab on it. When I moved to a venture backed AI computing startup (Series C), it was this skillset of opportunity spotting that I took along. Performing a deep dive on multiple industries, identifying use-cases of AI adoption and figuring out market entry points was an extension of what I learnt in VC. I lost no time in applying the same principles and mental frameworks. But I couldn’t have been more wrong. At Columbia, I took quantitative courses centered around ML to get a feel of the implementation part of adopting AI solutions. It was my first exposure to Python, a language which The Economist has referred to as the world’s most popular coding language and the lingua franca of most people working in AI/ data science. In the past 12 months Americans have searched for Python on Google more often than for Kim Kardashian, a reality-TV star. A commonly used phrase (cliche?) by managers is to take a ‘30,000 ft. view’ towards building a business. As a young professional interested in technology businesses, I was so caught up in trying to hone that skill that I didn’t realize that my interest area required a different approach. However, getting hands-on with the execution side of ML via coursework, couple of MOOCs’, projects involving client delivery and a lot of reading has led me to the conclusion that the traditional way of evaluating opportunities in the AI space is incomplete at best and rudimentary at worst. Here’s a 3 step framework that I now use. “Without data, you’re just another person with an opinion.” W. Edwards Deming has been described as the national folk hero of Japan for reviving its industry after World War II. His introduction contains a lot of adjectives but going by his above quote, we must add ‘prescient’ to that. A course work project involving logistic regression and decision trees took a team of 3 around 20+ hours to group publicly available data across years, figure out what we could actually do with the dataset collected, understand factors that could help us predict the output and decide on the combination of factors that we were going to use. It probably took us around 20% of that time to build the model and draw conclusions. Over the last quarter of 2018, our project team has consulted with a global market-intelligence firm and a NASDAQ listed ad-tech company. We are using deep learning/data analytics to solve business process challenges. For an automatic keyword extraction project with multiple types of articles, our ideal approach would have been to draw from deep key phrase extraction research being done by pioneers in the NLP world. But when we received data from our client, we realized that the annotated data would not suffice to build a traditional deep learning based model. We are now back to the table to research on statistical methods/manual annotations to work through it. To really understand what it takes to build AI/ML powered solutions, you need to work with your first dataset. Either for a course project or a deployment ready solution, major tasks of AI require practitioners to train algorithms with vast amounts of data. It takes disproportionate time to collect, clean and organize such data when compared to working on algorithms. Many industry professionals are voicing the opinion that it is actually datasets and not algorithms that drive breakthroughs. Looking at solutions being implemented in the industry from a competitive analysis perspective without thinking through what datasets gave a certain company a competitive advantage, what partnerships opened up access and an estimation of the underlying approach might just prove to be redundant when your team works on putting a roadmap in place. If you are on the business side, any tangible recommendation slide should have a section detailing what the organization’s approach towards obtaining/handling data should be. As a recovering VC industry professional, I still love the concept of a business moat (and the word keeps cropping up in my blog too!). When I had to research on AI adoption across industries, my first move was to understand how companies across the world were using AI today. But then, you can’t see what is most in vogue today and put your eggs in that basket. You need to have an inkling of what tomorrow brings. To account for this, we tracked sub-areas where there were growing VC investments. However, in hindsight, this might not have been a complete solution. This was my traditional ‘opportunity spotting’ tendency kicking into full force. Once you take a peek at the implementation part of it, you realize the dizzying pace of research and wide set of solutions that exist to solve business needs. Take the case of image recognition for example. Cloud hosted AI/ML platforms of the kind of Google Vision/ Amazon Rekognition/Clarifai have made it easier for face recognition, detecting objects, text detection, logos/landmark detection. Then there are other solutions like OpenCV which bundle a host of algorithms for the same. These plug and play kind of platforms have largely reduced the need for firm to hire vision engineers for low-hanging use cases. But globally, computer vision is a hot space with billions of dollars of venture money flowing into this area with the Chinese startup SenseTime alone raising $1.2 billion. Different business use-cases require algorithms with varying levels of sophistication. Different levels of sophistication motivates companies to push the barriers of what was previously possible. There is no single number than can capture the size of the opportunity just like there is no single one algorithm-fits all approach. There’s another point here. Annual business review meetings have a 3–5 year strategic plan. But several factors have contributed to an explosion of AI research and we see a changing definition of state of the art, sometimes in as short intervals as a year. Sample this. Let us take a look at underlying infrastructure to look at the ‘velocity’ of progress. In a year and a half, the time required to train a network to classify images from the famous ImageNet corpus has fallen from one hour to about 4 minutes. The AI index report mentions that this has been possible due to both algorithmic innovation and better infrastructure. Now, imagine the cascading impact on other areas across training and inference at the cloud or at the edge due to these advancements. Side Note: Recommend reading the AI Index report (2018). It is authored by professionals/ subject matter experts from Open AI and a host of other universities led by Stanford and is an authoritative text summarizing key happenings.So, the idea of a business moat is not long term in nature but a temporary advantage as the times they are a-changin. From a strategy perspective, it is important to think of ways to sustain it and this usually comes from progress on the quantitative side (combining hardware-software engineering/ data science etc. here). This brings me to the final step. “Content without method leads to fantasy; method without content to empty sophistry.” I was interviewing for a Product Internship role (Machine Learning focus) at a major real-estate tech company (B2C) when I had the opportunity to ask my interviewer a question towards the end. “How do you incorporate/evaluate product ideas your data science team comes up with in your roadmap?” “Oh! That tends to happen a lot. We usually…………… .” It is natural to assume that product vision is set by the business team. In industries like semiconductors etc. where product roadmap is set in stone, this might be true. But when it comes to AI, this logic is flawed. In fast-changing fields, the quantitative guys are at the forefront of innovation. At a 30,000 ft view (can’t resist!), most of the current advancements we are seeing in cutting edge research around deep learning/ vision have been initiated by one researcher’s untiring efforts. Jeff Dean from Google, John Giannandrea from Apple, Ilya Sutskever from Open AI, Yann Le Cunn from Facebook have all been part of multiple business units commercializing products worth $billions and none of them have taken a business school course ever. The line between engineering and business professionals will be a blurred one in any AI related application. The researchers at the AI computing firm had unique insights on what differentiated a particular algorithm for a particular use case. At the executive level, it was the Software Head who took a keen interest in understanding if there was a primary use-case/product fit. This point of seeking out advice from quantitative team members was drilled into me when working on projects at Columbia. A call with a data scientist from the market intelligence firm gave us more insights than 3 meetings with the business analyst responsible for project delivery. We were focusing on accuracy of the classification instead of improving our recall value. It is a ratio change when you are on the business side but an whole change in approach for the data scientist on our team. 30,000 ft. views (one last time!) usually looks at business strategies from the top. Equivalent to the train-test considerations (bias/ variance), my experience has been that the unless you involve your data scientists/ engineers in Strategy sessions, there is every chance that you might be on the receiving end of untoward surprises during the implementation phase. That’s probably why most companies are locked in a talent war to hire AI talent. The opportunity cost of not doing so is a real business threat. “We have had difficulty filling jobs for a number of years. It does slow things down.” As I delve deeper into topics around AI/ML that would help me better communicate with engineering/data science teams, I see a lot of ads related to picking up AI/ML skills on my social media feeds. They mostly follow a template indicating a statistic related to AI adoption by businesses and a course that will help you pick up concepts. The duration varies from anywhere between 6 days to 6 months depending on usually two sets of target audience — business professionals in case of the former and college students for the latter. I am not sure if a 6 day course has enough of depth to cover the basic difference between classification and clustering algorithms or explain what constitutes statistics vs ML vs AI. However, if you are a business professional fascinated by this space, I think there is a better way to understand the true implications of it. One that will aid you better in building strategy.

Snap’s Chief Evan Spiegel: Taming Tech and Fighting with Facebook,"America’s youngest billionaire on Snapchat’s future and why he limits his kids’ screen time,Written by The Financial Times"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story The Financial Times Follow Financial Times -- 2 Share By Tim Bradshaw It only takes about 30 seconds of waiting in line at Nando’s before somebody recognises Evan Spiegel. “You’re not from Snapchat, are you?” a young man asks. “You are! Oh! Good to see you.” Spiegel has got better at dealing with these encounters. Though he described himself this year as shy, the 28-year-old stands out today with his sharp dark suit, white open-collar shirt and certain kind of LA sheen. He immediately introduces me, as if the guy would care at all who I am, and asks what he is up to. Spiegel may not be quite as famous as Mark Zuckerberg — nobody has so far made a semi-fictionalised movie about him — or the founders of Google. But as America’s youngest billionaire and co-founder of Snapchat, the picture-messaging app used by 186m people every day, this is the kind of thing that tends to happen when you’re hanging around in a chicken-and-chips joint. During the course of 2018, Wall Street has fallen out of love with Spiegel. Shares in Snapchat’s parent company Snap are ending the year almost 75 per cent below their peak in February. But the paradox of Snapchat has long been that even if grown-ups write it off, the kids still flock to it. The same seems to be true of its creator. Our new friend, a DJ manager, is so star-struck that he doesn’t know what to do when called forward to the counter to order. Stay and seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pitch to the Snap chief executive? Or hurry forward for some peri-peri chicken with macho peas and unlimited drink refills? Spiegel is polite and friendly, suggesting that the DJ manager send over some of his artists’ tracks. He isn’t fazed by calling out his email address in the middle of a Friday lunch crowd. The DJ manager doesn’t think to ask why Spiegel, who flew in to London for a few hours on his private jet to speak at a media conference, is stopping off at a Nando’s on the south side of the Thames. There are so many people waiting for a table that I worry we will have to conduct our interview… -- -- 2 Financial Times Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*NzwoyCqOszU1oXOkDqN8iQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*NzwoyCqOszU1oXOkDqN8iQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1500/1*Ypyx1-iN6BLfP5yRWB8Ykw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*NzwoyCqOszU1oXOkDqN8iQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*NzwoyCqOszU1oXOkDqN8iQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*gePePBPfLpozKJHEmmcmRw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*NzwoyCqOszU1oXOkDqN8iQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*8cg8wHVahT2NDMLp8LCiTg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*NzwoyCqOszU1oXOkDqN8iQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*lRQG0ufhePPL3VHBPgOmgw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*NzwoyCqOszU1oXOkDqN8iQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*RpP6Ja-NJXxeTDhQcbUbow.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*NzwoyCqOszU1oXOkDqN8iQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*Ans6sKAILtR_3JrzUVH-5A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*2s48FXT-YXuen8EdcpUWog.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*7-Vd2V6yvsrRROavIg5RFg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UcHuqKR_WHcArkA6GSCqsw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*LJX4105V6hQB6a11nyvlhA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*Pmv1fEr_mU5XfnOhXJlVpg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/0*blhJW81XOQHXx8WL.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*pN0q7fJWoIw59mXAz46x3Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*bOVFN2_iLTHM5m2c.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg']",3-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@Financial_Times?source=post_page-----c714b8c54984--------------------------------,228,10 min read
The failure of Wechat in India & a new breed of Chinese entrepreneurs,"Written by Dinesh,A new brand of Chinese entrepreneurs"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Dinesh Follow -- 1 Listen Share Factordaily did a story about how Wechat failed in India. It’s quite well written & parts of the story are contributed by my friend & former colleague Himanshu Gupta. If you haven’t read it, you can check it out here — https://factordaily.com/how-wechat-faded-into-the-silence-in-india/. As someone who’s followed the evolution of chat apps & used most of them extensively, i thought i’ll offer my thoughts on the subject. A key argument in the blog is that Wechat failed to localize it’s product for the Indian market. In my view while localization plays a part in success of a platform, the bigger ideology behind the product & deeper market conditions usually lead to the success or failure of a particular product. Here by localization i mean adding/removing/modifying features or translating app text/content(Example local music in Tik-tok) or changing notation/icons(clap instead of like) not re-thinking the product for the native market & designing from ground up met to their needs specifically. When launching a new product in an existing market, the most important factor is differentiation. One simply can’t compete with the same features for the same set of users. There are 2 approaches to launching a product — launch on a smaller scale, understand the key needs & iterate(something Newsdog is also doing with multiple apps) or (if $$$ permitting) do a big bang launch to generate curiosity among your users & try to make users jump ship. Wechat when they launched in India focused on Voice notes — a feature used in China to a great extent to differentiate & the social aspect of the app. The TV campaign got them a initial set of users but maybe in the end the users didn’t use the features highlighted. The set of users who used the app was still English speakers who preferred text messaging to voice notes. Then in Nov 13, they tried the ‘all-in-one social app’ messaging. To understand why Whatsapp won where Wechat struggled one has to consider the history of the two products. Whatsapp is primarily a chat app, it helps you communicate with one another. Quickly. Wechat on the other hand was already a social network & chat system in China before coming to India. When Wechat launched in India, India already had a strong Facebook presence where we ‘added our friends’, we didn’t need another social network. And as Himanshu points out ‘’built for richer media interactions such as stickers, voice messages and video calling’ it’s product didn’t work on lower end devices in India. On the other hand Whatsapp took a different route. They had a simple philosophy — make communication seamless for everyone. This meant their biggest design principle was simplicity. They didn’t add unnecessary features keeping the product simple to use for everyone. And more importantly since the founders of Whatsapp were tech guys — they focused on improving the tech infrastructure so that it worked on various network conditions & low memory devices. At a time when SMS charges were exhorbitant, Whatsapp with it’s free messaging was just what users in India wanted. Whatsapp spread like wildfire. If you want to read more about Whatsapp’s design philosophy, check this blog post by Charlie Deets — https://medium.com/facebook-design/one-year-designing-at-whatsapp-c20b4c46bae6 Also Whatsapp worked on all phones from the very beginning — Nokia, Windows, Android, iOS — all of them, thus making sure you could communicate with all of your friends regardless of the device they used. Quite simply, Whatsapp was the better messaging product & all Indians cared about was messaging. Not finding users to chat with nearby or chatting with random strangers using shake. The other important player in the market decided to target younger users. Hike did a whole bunch of innovations to start with. Private chat mode, Indian stickers & ‘hide last seen’ — all directly attacked Whatsapp & were essential in getting a young user-base to shift to Hike. It’s referral program for free recharge helped it get more users in the short term. However in the end, the network effects of Whatsapp were just too powerful for Hike to survive & with the messaging application battle lost Hike increasing looked to evolve it’s app around the payments & social. Hike tried in vain with multiple TV advertising campaigns & another recharge program in a bid to boost falling usage but i suppose in the end it was too uphill a battle. In hindsight one can say Hike spread it’s bets too far & lost focus but had it worked we’ll just say they kept experimenting to win. Over time Whatsapp integrated more deeply into the users lives. We made groups to keep up with each other, we shared news & content with one another. We used Whatsapp to share photos. And to share location. And smaller businesses sent files using the app. Slowly work communication moved to Whatsapp since it was just faster & simpler than using email. Also since everyone was hooked onto Whatsapp, the replies were faster when you pinged here. So more people pinged on Whatsapp. People changed their DP to broadcast a new place they had been to or to just profess their love for selfies. Parents spied on their kids using ‘last seen’. And insecure couples fought over it. Then came the blue ticks & that took the whole game to a newer level. As Himanshu points out quite accurately, since WeChat was fighting a competitive battle with China at the time, it was less keen to invest in product changes in India. This has been the case typically with large social companies whose revenue comes to a great extent from their home markets. Facebook isn’t very keen to customize features for India nor is Snapchat keen to improve it’s tech for emerging markets. Only recently with Jio have multiple players woken up to the India opportunity with Google building a special Next Billion Users team to build applications specifically for India. In April 2014, Facebook started forcing users to download the messenger app to continue to chat with their friends. A master move as part of a broader unbundling effort, it led to a swift rise in the usage of messenger. A big reason for the move was Facebook recognizing that messaging was a much more sticky and frequent use-case than social networking. Having said all this, in my opinion WeChat gave up too early. If we follow the timeline, Tencent had the financial might & engineering capability to make it big difference & there was always the possibility of Whatsapp losing it’s way in the middle like Uber. Consider the music streaming market — Gaana has persisted over the years with multiple TV campaigns & product iterations to emerge as the leading player right now. Utility apps like Shareit, CleanMaster & multiple photo editors have had success in international markets for a long time. But before Bytedance did it with Tik-Tok & Bigo went big in South East Asia, taking an app built in China & expanding it across the world wasn’t something one imagined possible especially in content & social media space. Zhang Yiming’s success will inspire a newer age of Chinese entrepreneurs to dream big & explore international markets. It’s already happening with 44 of top 100 apps on the Indian playstore in 2018 being Chinese. So what’s changed from 2012 to now? The Chinese have gotten better at understanding the Indian market & executing on their plans. Tik-tok has tied up with Avneet Kaur, Jannat Zubair(plays Pankti in Tu Aashiqui Hai)- young faces of Indian television it’s audience identifies with to promote their product & people who have a higher engagement with their users than a Katrina Kaif/Parineeti Chopra. Vigo-video has video content partnerships with Elvish Yadav & MakejokeOf — both immensely popular channels from Haryana & Kanpur respectively. They’ve opened up offices in India to engage with creators & support them. When they merged Musically with Tik-tok, they got all creators to publish a video explaining the new brand to quell the expected backlash. In short, they’re just executing better. WeChat lost because it only committed partly to winning the Indian market but the newer age of Chinese entrepreneurs are in it to win it. That’s it for now.

"Give Web Developers a Code Editor and a Trumpet, What Happens?","Not What I Expected: My Web-Midi Demo in This Year’s Chrome Dev Summit,A MIDI Keyboard,MIDI All Things!,Let There Be… Light!,Written by Uri Shaked,This Is Not Going To Work!,There Was No User Interface,The Best User-Interface for Developers, Code Editor,The Conference Day,Developers with Code Editor and Trumpet 👩‍💻🎺,Developers Love Abstractions,Abstracting Away The Code Editor,Developers Are Full of Surprises"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Uri Shaked Follow -- 1 Listen Share It all began when I failed to build a Trumpet Playing Robot in Geekcon. Shortly after, I was invited to present a demo at the Chrome Dev Summit, and thought this would be a great opportunity to explore a new API I always wanted to play with (literally) — Web MIDI. The result was not quite what I was expecting, as you will shortly discover. Last year, I presented the In-Real-Life Chrome T-Rex Game in the same event. It was a fun experience, and I learnt a whole bunch of new skills. It was, however, a huge undertaking for me — I spent a month of my life trying to make that happen, and fixed issues with the hardware and bugs in the software up to the very last moment, in the hotel room the night before the conference. I didn’t want to repeat the same experience this year, so I tried to go with a less demanding project this time. After spending some more time tinkering with the trumpet and even creating an JavaScript and Angular powered device that would measure the air pressure, I realized I was heading exactly to the same direction as the last year — much work, high risk, very demanding project. So I sent the conference organizers an email: After explaining the situation in short, I presented them with two options: An hour later, Robert Nyman replied: So my goal was set to provide the “Best Experience”. Challenge Accepted! I spent the next few weeks building the electronics for the trumpet, designing a 3D-printed finger mechanism for it, and even coming up with a Web-Audio based sound engine for it. The project still consumed much of my time, but it also provided me with a bunch of post topics for my daily blogging challenge. Fast forward to the days before the conference. It was just after AngularConnect, and I was travelling in the airplane to the bay area. At that time, I had all the electronics for the project ready and packed inside my luggage, but there was one missing piece — I spent so much time getting the hardware to work that I totally neglected the user interface part. I only had a simple web page that provided a piano-like interface: This was obviously not the “Best Experience” for the Chrome Dev Summit attendees. As I had WiFi in the plane, I decided to spend my 10 hours flight working on that. I started by asking myself: what would be the best user interface for the summit attendees — developers? The goal of the project was to educate developers about the Web MIDI API, so it made a lot of sense to show them the JavaScript code that powered the demo. But then I thought — why only see the code? Code editors are where most developers feel at home. I decided this would be the user interface for my demo, so the attendees will not only see the code behind it, but will also be able to tinker with it and save their modified versions. Then, by the end of the conference, I will have a gallery of user-contributed code snippets that play different tunes. Or so I thought… I spent the first few hours of the flight researching different solutions. After comparing several alternatives (such as codemirror, which I also used for tsquery-playground), I decided to go with Monaco Editor, which is the editor from Visual Studio Code. It provides code auto completion and types checking (thanks to tight integration with TypeScript), which is essential when exploring a new API. You can try it yourself by using the simulator version. This is a special version that simulates the Web MIDI API, so I could test the code while without a real MIDI instrument connected to my computer (obviously, playing a real trumpet while in the plane wouldn’t be practical. Or would it? 😉). A couple of hours later, the project was more or less ready, and I landed in San Francisco. It was probably the most productive flight I had so far, and surprisingly I managed to squeeze nearly 1GB of data out of the plane’s WiFi (400MB of which consumed just by npm). You can find the complete source code for this project on GitHub, including some tricks I employed to visualize the code execution (more on that in a future post). When I got to the hotel, I quickly unpacked and started assembling the project in my hotel room: A quick dry-run revealed that despite the long journey, everything was still functional, and worked well with the editor I hacked together during the flight. Ready for the prime time! Finally, the big day has arrived! I was really curious to see whether the attendees will take on the opportunity to write some code for my demo. So I arrived early at the conference venue to set everything up: Despite having worked perfectly in the hotel, there were some issues with the getting the Raspberry Pi connected to the conference’s WiFi, but thanks to the very helpful event organizers, an Ethernet cable was provided and an hour later everything was ready. Then, came the first surprise: My friend Lars Knudsen also attended the conference, and as he knew about my project, he decided to surprise me and brought a MIDI keyboard 🎹. Then came the brilliant idea of creating a JavaScript code snippet that would connect the keyboard with the trumpet — You play the keyboard, get the sound out of the trumpet: and the result: But it didn’t stop there. He also “happened” to have a MIDI Saxophone (I didn’t even know such thing exists), so he connected it too, and now he could play the Saxophone and get the sound out of the trumpet: Just when I thought I have seen it all, Ruth John suddenly appeared with a mysterious MIDI device and plugged it into the demo: A few minutes later, her device was controlling the trumpet, too: That was definitely an unexpected twist in a plot! But what happened with my original hypothesis? Did people actually write code to play songs? When I wrote the “Web MIDI Playground”, the code editor for my demo, I included a sample code snippet that plays a few notes, so others could use it as a starting point. Lars took the opportunity to code “Hava Nagila”, which you can listen to in the online simulator. Next, Shmuela Jacobs coded some song her baby loves listening to: She hit “Run!” and started moving to the tune: She also told me that it was her first time writing code with async / await, and she really liked how straight forward it was. The other attendees played her code snippet more than 50 times throughout the event! So yeah, people were actually writing code to play some music during the conference. What I didn’t anticipate was… Markus was a Swiss guy I met in Espruino forums after sharing the experience of bringing back a fried Espruino board from the dead. After he learned about my project, he volunteered to help with manning the booth during the event. He arrived shortly after we connected the MIDI keyboard to the project: As you would expect from a seasoned developer, he immediately recognized the opportunity to create an abstraction layer, and spent the next two hours working on this piece of code, creating an interpreter for some text-based music notation format he came up with: Markus also included the lyrics (as you can see above), and interpreter displays them on screen as the song is playing, turning the project into a trumpet-karaoke machine: The next surprise was the brainchild of Reilly Grant, a software engineer on the Chrome team. We met in the summit a year before, and this year he also volunteered to help manning the demo booth. After observing many attendees play melodies using the MIDI keyboard, he came up with a brilliant idea: He spent about an half an hour writing a “Composer” snippet, that would record whatever you played on the keyboard, and would spit out code that plays the same thing. You could then copy this code and save it in your own snippet. My original intention was to have the attendees write code to play the trumpet, but thanks to Lars’es keyboard and Reilly’s piece of code, they now had an interface where they could create the code without actually writing it. It was all abstracted away! This resulted in a bunch of new code snippets that were recorded by the attendees, such as the following: But the fun didn’t end here. Reilly, who remember my magical battery powered smart light bulb from the previous year, asked me if I had it with me. Luckily, I did, so we proceeded to combine the Web MIDI code together with Web Bluetooth: We wrote a short piece of code that uses Web Bluetooth to connect to the bulb and light it whenever you played a note. About 15 minutes later, he had this working: So now you could also make a disco light show while playing the trumpet with keyboard! When I started working on this project, I didn’t really know what to expect. Projects presented at conferences are usually watch-only or have limited ways you can interact with them (like the T-Rex game last year). This time, I gave the attendees the full power of a code editor, and I wasn’t sure where they will take it. I was really blown away by all of different ways the attendees programmed my robot and connected it to all sort of other MIDI devices, as well as created interesting abstractions on top of the code editor.

Do Companies Actually Need Blockchain?,"Are you ready for the Future?,Do you guarantee Data-Security?,Everyone is a Tech-Company!,One way to find out if Blockchain is suitable for your business is to evaluate your firm needs.,Another way is to evaluate to opportunities Blockchain opens up on efficiency and security improvements, alternative financing for new business units or expansion.,Databases,Permissionless Blockchains,Permissioned Blockchains,Blockchain’s strategic value is mainly in cost reduction,Characteristics of high‐potential use cases,Written by Iliya Zaki,Moonwhale Ventures Business Consulting and Startup Advisory,About The Author"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Iliya Zaki Follow HackerNoon.com -- Listen Share Blockchain Technology is the talk of the town these days and integrating the tech into your business can be advantageous. However, enterprises should weigh their options wisely. The technology can drastically help reduce cost, increase revenue and eliminate the need of a middle-man. But as it is still relatively new and untested, blockchain’s benefits come at the expense of speed of transaction. For now.. 😉 Let us take a look at several conditions that can help you decide whether blockchain technology is truly needed in your business. The hype, speculative new assets such as Cryptocurrencies and alternative fundraising means like ICOs, surrounding ‘Blockchain’ has exaggerated the realistic capabilities and applications of this new technology. Businesses, developers, and investors have yet to identify the right applications that are appropriate for distributed ledger technology. Databases have been used for decades to persist state and query data. Decades worth of research has been invested to optimize the different layers of query processing. Permissionless Blockchains are public ledgers that are not managed by a centralized authority. That is, the ledger is distributed across a dynamic network of peers. Permissioned Blockchains represent a hybrid design. They are not centralized to a single entity, yet they are authorized to a small set of preselected trusted peers that can write state. After looking at these different systems, it is easy to realize that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Everything is a trade-off. Different applications have different requirements and hence different appropriate solutions. The sole distinction between public and private blockchain is related to who is allowed to participate in the network, execute the consensus protocol and maintain the shared ledger. A public blockchain network is completely open and anyone can join and participate in the network. The network typically has an incentivizing mechanism to encourage more participants to join the network. Bitcoin is one of the largest public blockchain networks in production today. One of the drawbacks of a public blockchain is the substantial amount of computational power that is necessary to maintain a distributed ledger at a large scale. Another disadvantage is the openness of public blockchain, which implies little to no privacy for transactions and only supports a weak notion of security. A private blockchain network requires an invitation and must be validated by either the network starter or by a set of rules put in place by the network starter. Businesses who set up a private blockchain will generally set up a permissioned network. This places restrictions on who is allowed to participate in the network, and only in certain transactions. Whether to adopt blockchain is not merely a technological decision; it is also a business decision. Great use cases solve real problems at a cost that is significantly lower than the benefits the adoption brings. Blockchain’s unique properties, meaning that a new analytical framework is useful, in part because of the fact that blockchain has emerged at a unique point in society’s technological development. While the application of technology to improve business processes is nothing new, previous generations of technology were predominantly about the faster and more secure exchange of information. Blockchain, meanwhile, is about the exchange of value; it is intended to enable individuals to exchange currency and other assets with one another without relying on a third party to manage the transactions. It also implies the dramatic redefinition of the business processes associated within and between companies. Blockchain might have the disruptive potential to be the basis of new operating models, but its initial impact will be to drive operational efficiencies. Cost can be taken out of existing processes by removing intermediaries or the administrative effort of record keeping and transaction reconciliation. This can shift the flow of value by capturing lost revenues and creating new revenues for blockchain-service providers. Based on a McKinsey survey, “approximately 70 percent of the value at stake in the short term is in cost reduction, followed by revenue generation and capital relief” Cryptocurrency’s core advantages are low-fee transferability, ability to transact cross-borders and deflationary character in case of value appreciation/ storage. Blockchain’s main advantages are decentralization, cryptographic security, transparency, and immutability. It allows information to be verified and value to be exchanged without having to rely on a third-party authority. Optimize blockchain strategy based on market position. Identified promising use cases, develop strategies and design choices to shape a viable solution. Industry leader should act now to maintain their market positions and take advantage of the opportunity to set industry standards. As dominant players pursuing use cases with fewer requirements for coordination and regulatory approval, they can establish market solutions.

How can you measure the importance of “soft skills”?,"Digital Divisions,The importance of “soft skills”,Written by Bethany Crystal"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Bethany Crystal Follow Age of Awareness -- 7 Listen Share Earlier this fall, my husband and I took ourselves out for a “date night” in New York City and wound up at a Japanese steakhouse restaurant, one where you’re seating at a table of 8–10 other people and a chef cooks all of the food on a piping hot iron griddle right in front of you. We used to go for special occasions as a family growing up. Yes, the food (often a mix of stir fried vegetables and meat) is often quite good. But let’s be honest — you’re paying for the fun experience of watching food get prepared. It’s a highly social dining event. The chef will often play to his table, picking on the youngest one by encouraging them to catch shrimp tails in their pockets or “fake them out” with a prank container of hot sauce that they pretend to squirt right at you. When we went on date night, we were at a table of 6 — the two of us and four younger folks that looked to be high school age or early college. A couple of them were drinking, a couple weren’t, and the group of four was celebrating the youngest one’s birthday. While this was still a highly engaging experience, we were shocked to see one common similarity among the younger folks next to us: Each one of them had their phone directly in front of their face for 90% of the dinner / show experience. Yes, sometimes they were adding to their live Instagram story (for instance, when he created an “onion volcano” and set it on fire), but for most of the time, they were just…in different worlds. We had a lot of questions for them (which clearly we didn’t ask): Why pay so much money for an experience if you don’t intend to be physically present and enjoy the moment? Why celebrate a birthday if you’re barely going to engage with the people next to you? And what does the increased prevalence of technology in your pocket mean for the development of key inter-personal social skills among our youth? This term tends to get a bad rep. As soon as you add the word, “soft” to anything, a lot of assumptions immediately get in the way: This is hugely problematic. Just because we’re adding more technology to the way we operate at work doesn’t mean we still won’t need to interact as humans to do our jobs. And if four friends can’t even sit around at a dinner table together and enjoy each other’s company and the social dynamic from a chef in front of them, how might they behave in a more professional context at work in a boardroom? In a 2017 study by Harvard scholar David J Deming (which you can read here), he found that, despite advances in technology, the need in our economy for skills requiring “soft skills” is going up (not down). Here’s some of what he found: “Analyzing employment trends between 1980 and 2012, Deming found that jobs requiring extensive interaction, such as teachers, managers, and nurses, grew by nearly 12 points as a share of the labor force, while analytical positions that required few social skills, including some engineering jobs, declined. Wages for “high math, low social skill” occupations increased by 5.9 percent, compared with 26 percent growth for “high math, high social skill” openings.” (Via: The 74) In case you’re more visual, here’s another way to put it. In an information age of more automation, the demand for “translator roles” — people who can either teach, manage, or interpret technology and systems, are more important than ever. To be clear, the definition of “soft skills” has so many different meanings any way you slice it. It is “people skills”? Is it communication skills? Is it workforce readiness training? And whether it’s one of these, all of these, or none of these, the next question is even trickier: Can this stuff be taught? This piece from The 74, digs much deeper into this study, these questions, and also some ways that schools (even at the K-12 level) are starting to incorporate some type of professional skills training into the classroom setting. It’s an incredibly worthwhile read and calls out some of the challenges (and hard-to-measure parts) of teaching skills like this. I’ve been thinking about this question for some time now and still don’t have an obvious answer. But I’d love to hear what you’ve seen. What’s working? What’s not? And how important is this “squishy stuff” in the end, anyway?

How DJI Became the Drone Industry’s Most Valued Company,"Written by Drone U,Are DJI’s Chinese Production Facilities the Sole Reason for their Success?,Competitors Are Finding It Tough to Compete with a Nimble DJI,How Is the Ongoing US China Trade War Affecting Markets?,What Does the Future Hold for Drone Markets?"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Drone U Follow -- Listen Share DA — Jiang Innovations or DJI is a Shenzen based company with humble origins. Frank Wong funded DJI with his university scholarship money back in 2006. The scenario today, is quite different, to say the least. DJI’s annual sales are estimated at a mammoth $3 billion. And they have nearly 3,000 employees on their roster. As per the latest round of funding in April 2018, DJI is now valued at a cool $15 Billion — which makes Frank the world’s first drone billionaire. So, how has DJI managed to reach this enviable position? Let us segue into our first point — their Chinese origins. To attribute DJI’s success simply to low production costs courtesy their Chinese production base is a narrow and incorrect view. Sure, low manufacturing costs are a factor — but certainly not the only one. Drone manufacturing is incredibly complicated and requires mastery over production processes such as injection molding and precision machining. Check out this cool video showing the manufacturing process for a drone frame mold: This is what Tim Cook from Apple had to say when he was asked about manufacturing iPhone's in China- “There’s a confusion about China… the popular conception is that companies come to China because of low labor cost. I’m not sure what part of China they go to but the truth is, China stopped being the low labor cost country many years ago and that is not the reason to come to China from a supply point of view… …the reason is because of the skill… and the quantity of skill in one location… and the type of skill it is. The products we do require really advanced tooling. And the precision that you have to have in tooling and working with the materials that we do are state-of-the-art. And the tooling skill is very deep here”. Clearly, manufacturing of drone parts is also an industry which requires tooling and engineering skills of the highest degree. So while low costs are one of the reasons for DJI’s success, access to skilled labor is an important factor as well. Another strong reason for DJI’s success is their responsiveness to market needs. Mike Winn, co-founder, DroneDeploy points out that using the same technology platform for consumer and enterprise solutions allows DJI to innovate and launch new products with lightning speed. So, this allows a Mavic user to have the same user experience when he upgrades to a Matrice — resulting in faster adoption as well. DJI’s recent partnership with Microsoft will allow DJI users access to the Microsoft ecosystem via a SDK. This will permit drone pilots to offer autonomous and scalable industry solutions. Check out this video to learn more: GoPro and DJI certainly make an interesting case study for folks wanting to study market strategy and competition. GoPro, founded in 2002 went public in 2014. Riding on the success of their action cameras, the GoPro stock price touched a high of $87 in October 2014. Today the stock is trading at less than 5 dollars. So what really happened? Arguably, GoPro’s biggest folly was their foray into the drone business — a decision that was fraught with trouble from the get go. After talks of a possible collaboration with DJI and 3DR fell through, GoPro decided to take control of the entire development and manufacturing process. After several delays, Karma was finally launched in late 2016. Citing stiff competition and low margins, GoPro exited the drone business completely in January 2018. In September 2018, GoPro released the Hero 7 which was touted as the “Gimbal Killer”. Well, DJI responded by combining a camera and gimbal to give us the “Osmo Pocket”. Costing $349, the Osmo Pocket is cheaper than the Hero 7 and gives us much sharper footage. This is what Paul Aitken, Drone U Chief Pilot had to say in his blog post, aptly titled, “SAY GOODBYE TO GOPRO, Family Footage Just Became More Enjoyable Thanks to the OSMO Pocket”. “No, cameras with stabilized sensors are not as smooth as the OSMO pocket. Even cameras that boast a stabilized sensor will not compete with a camera like the Osmo pocket. A stabilized sensor can only correct 15–20 degrees on the roll axis”. MOTA CEO, Michael Faro sums up the current market dynamics quite well: “We are not competing with DJI. That corner of the market is filled.” Last month, in response to the ongoing US-China Trade war, GoPro decided to stop manufacturing cameras for the US market in China. But, how have the trade wars affected DJI? Our good friends at DroneDJ reported the hike in prices for the Phantom 4 Pro/Adv Remote Controller to $749 in October 2018. Likewise prices for the Mavic 2 Pro were raised from $1,449 to $1,499 in the month of September. Whether this is in response to increased tariffs for Chinese manufactured goods is still open to speculation. Click HERE for the entire list of Chinese manufactured products that are subject to increased tariffs. This is what Mario Rebello, VP and Country Manager, North America has to say about the impact of increased tariffs on DJI products: “There has been impact. At times we’ll share the cost, and at times we’ll pass along the costs.” According to Bloomberg, DJI is considering moving to location with less tariff regulations. With primary drone markets like the US experiencing exponential growth, and with countries like India allowing commercial drone operations, there are no signs that the drone market will experience any slowdown in the coming years. In fact, Gartner predicts that the drone market will touch $11 billion by 2020. A strong R & D department and a nimble production line means that DJI is well poised to capture this growth. A willingness to work on wafer thin margins also makes it difficult for new competition to find a firm footing in the market. (It is estimated that DJI made a net profit of $120 million on sales of $1 billion in 2014) @TheDroneGirl reported that DJI’s market share has gone up from 72% in 2017 to 74% in 2018. In 2018, DJI delighted drone users by launching the Ronin S, the Mavic 2, the Phantom 4 RTK and the Osmo Pocket. According to industry rumors, DJI shall be announcing a new Matrice series at CES 2019. There has also been much speculation surrounding Terra, a trademark which was recently registered by DJI. DJI started a new company, DJI Terra B.V. based in Netherlands. Whether Terra is a mapping application or a land based drone, only time will tell.

Is Apple’s Cash Cow In Trouble?,"Reality distortion field in full swing over iPhone slowdown,Written by Paris Marx"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Paris Marx Follow -- 5 Listen Share Yesterday, trading of Apple’s stock was briefly paused for CEO Tim Cook to deliver some bad, but not wholly unexpected, news: revenue in Q1 2019 would fall far short of expectations, in large part due to slow iPhone sales. Reports have been coming out for a couple of months suggesting that Apple’s new slate of iPhones — XR, XS, and XS Max — were not selling as much as the company had expected, and now that’s been confirmed. When Apple reported its Q4 2018 numbers, it provided Q1 2019 guidance of $89 billion to $93 billion in revenue and a gross margin between 38 to 38.5 percent. Cook now says Q1 revenue will be closer to $84 billion — $5 billion below even its low-end target — and gross margin will come in at around 38 percent. But why is revenue, in particular, so much lower than expected? In Cook’s letter to investors, he singles out China as the main “challenge” the company faced in meeting its revenue targets, in particular the lower-than-expected iPhone sales in the region — but problems with the iPhone line go beyond Greater China. Apple has placed far too much attention on its share price in recent years, and now the issues with Apple’s product line are coming back to bite it. Any slowdown in the iPhone line is a huge problem for Apple because it alone accounted for nearly 63 percent of the company’s revenue in fiscal year 2018. When the iPhone falters, Apple falters — which makes all the stock buybacks and dividend increases Cook has spent the past several years pursuing to please investors useless. In explaining the lower iPhone revenues, Cook blames lower carrier subsidies, a stronger US dollar, and cheaper battery replacements — the latter of which he positioned as a benevolent move by the company in an interview with CNBC when it was actually a response to a massive scandal over slowing down batteries in older iPhones. While these things may have contributed to lower sales, they miss the bigger challenge that Apple is facing with the iPhone line, and the way Cook completely ignores it in his letter illustrates how the reality distortion field is still in full swing among Apple executives, and could ultimately be hindering them from addressing the real problem. In that same interview with CNBC, Cook says that carrier are offering lower subsidies, so for customers who have been out of the market for two to three years and are returning to get a new phone, everything looks more expensive. Except phones don’t just look more expensive, they are more expensive. Apple has been slowly increasing the price of iPhones for years, to the point where the cheapest of its new models now costs $749, but there are also base models for $999 and $1099 — higher prices are a trend across the whole product line. These prices are in large part a response to the significant decline in iPhone sales growth as the smartphone markets in the United States and China has become saturated. Since sales growth has stalled, average selling price needs to increase to keep overall revenue growing — but even that seems to be becoming a challenge. Despite the issues cited in China, Cook says all-time revenue records were set in the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Korea. The company has stopped reporting sales numbers, but it’s safe to assume this is a result of higher revenue from its premium phones — the iPhone XS and XS Max — not due to selling many more phones over last year. Apple is the iPhone. Sure, its other product lines are doing well, but none comes nearly as close to matching the size and importance to Apple’s bottom line. The company has so far avoided its reckoning with the state of the smartphone market by raising prices, but that strategy is already catching up to it. Even though Cook placed the blame elsewhere, there can be no doubt that higher iPhone prices are a contributing factor to the slowdown; it’s getting harder and harder to justify an upgrade, and raising prices again isn’t going to make it any easier. -- -- 5 Critic of tech futures and host of Tech Won’t Save Us: https://bit.ly/twsu Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*6OtO5KD9eF0hoE-ooIypYA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*zZfypGS8gIVvgyjrxkFKRw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:668/1*95PpmJtBYPeyTJkn09tTcA.gif', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*6OtO5KD9eF0hoE-ooIypYA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*W4xqj_1vfYfA_U_RDIAzgA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*6OtO5KD9eF0hoE-ooIypYA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*N0XS17z12jpl4u5lAu5t_w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*6OtO5KD9eF0hoE-ooIypYA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*YH8ftBeHwmHZBJ1s5hBhkQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*6OtO5KD9eF0hoE-ooIypYA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*gyrlop19YlVE6ChTUfK6kg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*6OtO5KD9eF0hoE-ooIypYA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*Ans6sKAILtR_3JrzUVH-5A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*2s48FXT-YXuen8EdcpUWog.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*7-Vd2V6yvsrRROavIg5RFg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*_wvc1IOHe1qT5s7-hNm2JQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*wzwnJD8UpPtAd2YoIPEiNQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*TcF9rICJPQZsrzNignSvgw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*nChshyHhYer985FIUWu6TA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*maC8NLpto3tNwluhoRODsw.png']",3-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@parismarx?source=post_page-----9215f813ee8b--------------------------------,137,4 min read
Capture Stereoscopic Images and Video with the Raspberry Pi-Based StereoPi,Written by Cabe Atwell," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Cabe Atwell Follow -- Listen Share The Raspberry Pi Compute Module was designed with industrial and automation applications in mind, but it can be tasked for much more, including a pair of cameras for grabbing stereoscopic images and video. That’s the idea behind the StereoPi — a carrier board, which can also be used for computer vision, drone, and robot projects. The open source board is compatible with all Compute Modules (1, 3, 3+) and runs Raspbian right out of the box. The StereoPi boasts a pair of CSI camera ports (supporting OV5647 and Sony IMX 219 cameras), micro USB port, micro SD card slot, a couple of USB ports, 1X USB header, HDMI, Ethernet, SO-DIMM connector, 5V power connector, on/off power switch, boot mode jumper, and a 40-pin GPIO header — all packed into a 90 x 40mm footprint. The StereoPi is versatile and has already been employed in some real world applications — such as pairing it with an Oculus Rift to render people in a third-person view, using it with ROS for simple depth-mapping, and stitching 360-degree panoramic images. Of course, the StereoPi can be used for a myriad of other applications, like building computer vision systems with OpenCV, live streaming video directly to YouTube from drone and robotic platforms, and even creating your own augmented and virtual reality systems. Beyond Raspbian and ROS, the board can be programmed using Python, C, and C++, depending on the project. The StereoPi isn’t yet available, however a batch of them have entered pre-production and have been thoroughly tested, which means they will go on to post-production shortly and will soon appear on Crowd Supply. UPDATE: StereoPi’s campaign has now launched on Crowd Supply, starting at $69 for the ‘slim edition’ and $89 for the ‘standard’ board. Starter and deluxe kits are also available for $125 and $199, respectively. -- -- Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*SjJYUdHqel-qRpR_W86lkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*v4nTtzhhCyN3hyKt0fvrHw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*h19RvNVjKEutoZGoY2FV8w.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*tR-jNXEQIlTnHDyLChWiQQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*SjJYUdHqel-qRpR_W86lkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*1NnjDc7JG2ne69On7G3x4A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*SjJYUdHqel-qRpR_W86lkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*fF_6uXS55HwxCd_kAydF2A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*SjJYUdHqel-qRpR_W86lkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*pArUSIOa_RgLQ_VjJdH37w.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*SjJYUdHqel-qRpR_W86lkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*LVPsyy_C6BJbhkxeDfoccw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*SjJYUdHqel-qRpR_W86lkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*u01TTl3zkzEwzxcu', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*zkiIc2xCBnY4LH0Y.', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qFjzEBBaulV3whZPWGAkIQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*iRcZ52AbwdD5MuXyfuyb5g.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*yuVzMhCJyDENbyhwAsrkwA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*VTeqo1MXkfd9kUsPeCe1Zw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*BP0fxGpmEb5sF_bqRS2y0A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*qCXYipt09STclOJBEyaCpA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*yuVzMhCJyDENbyhwAsrkwA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*RuDMD2Uopqdj2M2_SfKVMg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*yUnYROZpeG5e4uP_ZGhLdQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*2fKFxUgWIGIIjCVtaGxv0A.jpeg']",3-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@CabeFSAtwell?source=post_page-----85741fb7a67d--------------------------------,20,2 min read
Apple’s Cook Faces Toughest Test Yet Navigating iPhone Slowdown,Written by Bloomberg," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Bloomberg Follow Bloomberg -- 1 Share By Mark Gurman Apple Inc.’s Tim Cook confirmed Wednesday that the latest iPhones, his flagship product, are not selling up to expectations. The news exposes his toughest challenge since taking over as chief executive officer from the legendary Steve Jobs: how to take the company forward when its top product has lost luster with consumers. Cook has dealt with a series of controversies during his more than seven years in the role, ranging from the company’s failed Google Maps replacement launch and the need to oust the head of iPhone software in 2012, to concerns over labor and tax practices. He has calmly navigated the politics of President Donald Trump’s administration, and so far has avoided tariffs on the company’s key devices as the U.S.-China trade war widens. Now comes the disclosure in a letter to investors that Apple sold fewer than anticipated new iPhones, and would cut its holiday quarter sales outlook by as much as $9 billion. Cook plans to address Apple staff about the situation on Thursday at an all-hands meeting where he will take questions from workers, according to a person familiar with the matter. “This is probably one of the hardest things Tim Cook has had to do as CEO, putting out that letter today,” said Michael Gartenberg, a former Apple… -- -- 1 Bloomberg Find more like this at bloomberg.com Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*aFLLGsE20mi1mOuO8HH9ug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*rO6YSqzbHG56iNxqAveFYw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1500/1*7TxeL0XPzIKam1_ymtreAA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*aFLLGsE20mi1mOuO8HH9ug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*rO6YSqzbHG56iNxqAveFYw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*QBfZjRe0uyWvzrOWqunUAg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*aFLLGsE20mi1mOuO8HH9ug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*A8KrgOLTtTeTisOHKxAW2Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*DORJzGYMOG6Pgzao.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*UJrMvAM16lfbHGyEa3OmNw.gif', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*aFLLGsE20mi1mOuO8HH9ug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*Hk-4Q7fe1axiIiPSLyhuVA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*aFLLGsE20mi1mOuO8HH9ug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*niQ0sAwUszuyNMyH.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*pZPMtIONqtJYi2xHYD_Ivg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*_wvc1IOHe1qT5s7-hNm2JQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*wzwnJD8UpPtAd2YoIPEiNQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*TcF9rICJPQZsrzNignSvgw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*Ans6sKAILtR_3JrzUVH-5A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*2s48FXT-YXuen8EdcpUWog.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*7-Vd2V6yvsrRROavIg5RFg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*P-F-0XkuulKftthz', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*FZEG_DxaZ4g-w10VST7WGg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg']",3-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@bloomberg?source=post_page-----62d2f4a6f968--------------------------------,91,4 min read
How Children Interact with Digital Media,"Parents may loathe them, but they are here to stay,Written by The Economist"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story The Economist Follow -- 1 Share “Turn off media, turn on life”, urges the promotional video from South Korea’s Nori Media Education Centre for the Prevention of Internet Addiction, an organisation funded by a mixture of private and public money. Its manager, Kwon Jang-hee, is passionate about protecting children from the ill effects of the internet, and above all of smartphones, which he considers most damaging of all because of their omnipresence. Parents do not understand how dangerous the internet is, he says, pointing to a study by Seoul National University that detected similarities between the brain activity of cocaine addicts and computer-games enthusiasts. If he had his way, youngsters would have to wait for their smartphones until they had graduated from high school. In one of the world’s most highly connected societies there is little chance that he will get his wish, but plenty of South Korean parents agree that their children are overdosing on screens. A recent government survey on smartphone and internet addiction put the share of three- to nine-year-olds at high risk of addiction at 1.2% and that of teenagers at 3.5%. That may not seem a lot, but when it happens the effects can be devastating. Some of these children are on their phones for at least eight hours a day and lose interest in offline life. Having tried and failed to wean them from their devices, their desperate parents turn to the government, which offers various kinds of counselling, therapy and, in extreme cases, remedial boot camps. Hong Hyun-joo, who works on the boot-camp programme for the regional government of Gyeonggi, South Korea’s most populous province, says the kids undergoing the treatment are usually aged 14–16, with about the same number of boys and girls. They hand in their smartphones when they arrive at the boot camp and spend 12 days living in dormitories, eating regular meals and engaging in lots of sport and group activities. The aim is to increase their self-esteem and get them to make friends. They mostly start off sullen but gradually become more co-operative. The claimed “cure” rate (meaning a return to more normal usage) is 70–75%. But the camps can take only a few hundred children a year, not remotely enough to meet demand. That would take a lot more… -- -- 1 Insight and opinion on international news, politics, business, finance, science, technology, books and arts.

Of course, I was disappointed when my other articles didn’t get much attention, but when I took a look at my erratic earnings, I realized that I had stumbled upon a golden opportunity to closely examine Medium’s stats — beyond fans and claps. Buckle up; I was serious when I said that this is going to be an in-depth analysis. I will examine the following: I will attempt to determine: theascent.pub I earned $241.96 for this article, which was published on December 18. The article received 22,000 views and ~1,000 claps in the first 24 hours, which was reflected in Week 4 below. The remaining views and claps are reflected in Week 5. This is the only one of my articles that keeps getting nearly 1,000 views per day, so for this one, I will do my calculations based on the stats I had on Sunday, when the pay period ended. They were roughly: Possible outlier: 21,000 views came from Flipboard, sometime between 1 and 4 hours after publishing, while I slept. This article was added to The Ascent a day afterwards. However, those 21,000 views on day 1 only resulted in ~200 claps, most of which were from non members. The remaining 15,000 views (and claps from Medium members) came from within Medium, immediately after distribution and publication in The Ascent. theascent.pub medium.com This article received claps from 3 people — all Medium members. One left 26 claps, and the other 2 left 1 clap each. medium.com medium.com Note: see below for an update about free articles that are not in publications. writingcooperative.com This one was published on December 24 and is listed as still awaiting review by Medium’s editors, probably because I had made it a members-only article inadvertently, and the publication had to change this. Value of claps and fans: Effects of distribution and publications: Worthy of note is that Medium might not ever review your story for distribution; their curation guidelines state that not all articles will be reviewed.

Is there a right time to post on Reddit?,"Written by adarsh,Some Heads-up,Weekday Analysis,Time Series Analysis"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in adarsh Follow Towards Data Science -- Listen Share This post was inspired by a friend of mine who analyzed the price difference between Amazon and eBay to get you the most savings on purchases using an extension called unlooted, which is a very cool read and you should check it out! Disclaimer: I have made a lot of assumptions from my analysis of this data. There is high probability it might be subjective and biased. Please do point out in the comments if you have anything to add or correct. So now onto our task at hand. Why would you want to time your posts? Definitely to increase the reach and the upvotes you get. But Reddit is not a mainstream social media like Facebook or Instagram. It’s a mostly anonymous social media where communities collectively exist. So why would you possibly want your post to reach the front-page? From the top of my head, a few logical options would be Okay, now we have a motive to get to the front-page and all that remains is the how-tos of getting there. So I made this considerably easier for you by flexing my new analytical skills and some visualizations. But remember, at the end of the day, this would only give your post a marginal advantage. If your post isn’t good enough for the community, it wouldn’t take off. So as a prerequisite, you need to understand Reddit and it’s userbase. Reddit is occupied mostly by North Americans (45%), the most popular subreddits like r/worldnews, r/tech, r/dankmemes, r/economics, also reflects this user composition. Most of the time, it is the content from these established subreddits that make it onto the r/all. Our analysis would only cover the process of getting into the front-page from one of these popular subreddits. The data was gathered using the PRAW package and the free pushshift.io API. You can view the scrapper that I wrote here. The data I collected had over 100,000 post instances collected over a period of the first 3 weeks of December. Reddit database uses the UTC timezone so all of the analysis is done on UTC timezone itself. We’ll be looking into the data of one such active subreddit, r/dankmemes. It has over 1.5 million subscribers and receives over 3000 memes (shitposts) per day. It peaks out on the weekend where it rises to 5200 and hits lows on Wednesdays. I’m assuming we can safely, to an extent, take the insights that we observe on this subreddit and generalize it to the popular part of Reddit. This behaviour is expected. People are more active during the weekend and during the middle of the work week, everyone is too brain tired to upvote and make memes. But don’t be fooled, even though the average number of upvotes on a post is around 600, about 90% of the posts get less than 1000 upvotes and doesn’t see the light of the front-page. In total 20% of the posts don’t even get more than a single upvote. Let’s start looking at the trends during a typical day. This is where things start getting really really interesting, and I had to make some assumptions on why things are such, but feel free to correct me in the comment section if you got anything to add. If we look at the time series graph during the day, we can see a downward-trend where there is a three-fold decrease in the content posted. So this is where the country demography of the platform becomes very prominent. Because for the active majority of Reddit it’s too early to be active (North America). After that, we can see an increase in the frequency as people really start shitposting from about 1 pm to 10 pm. Fair enough to assume that people have more time and energy to make and post stuff later in the workday. But… If we look at the average upvotes during the day, counterintuitively the demand for posts actually increases during the downtime of 5 am to 12 pm, which we take away from the steep rise in the average upvotes during this period, where it literally quadruples for posts, even though a good portion of Reddit is inactive. People want more content during this time but there is a deficiency of that, which I’m assuming is due to a good portion of the content creators (North Americans) are either sleeping or on their morning commute but the demand for content stays the same due to the other part of the world being active during this time. So the takeaway is that After this partial 6-hour content downtime, we can see the count increasing again signifying that people aren’t being productive in the office. So the general consensus? You could take lessons from these trends to optimize the timing of your posts on Reddit, but I’d just ignore these and just focus on making original, entertaining and informative content which is assured to get recognition anyway irrespective of time or day. In my original Notebook, I’ve made a much more detailed analysis of the data. Feel free to check that out and adapt my scrapper and notebook on any of the subreddits to gain insights and let me know what fun things you find out!

Have We Passed The Point of Maximum Useful Tech?,Written by Herb Bowie," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Herb Bowie Follow -- 3 Share By Herb Bowie Let us briefly review some of the significant events in the history of personal computing. 1983: Steve Jobs lures CEO John Sculley from Pepsi to Apple Computer, asking him: Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world? 1984: Football fans watching the Super Bowl see a now famous advertisement. In this sixty-second commercial a blond, athletic, brightly attired young woman heaves a huge hammer towards a grey talking head broadcasting a message of oppressive unity to a seated, emaciated multitude. The hammer shatters the screen, terminating the transmission, and we then hear: On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you’ll see why 1984 won’t be like “1984.” 1990: Steve Jobs remarks, in an interview for the Library of Congress: The computer is the most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with. It’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds. 2018: iPhone says: Weekly Report Available: You averaged 57 minutes of screen time last week. Whoa! What happened between 1990 and 2018? Who stuck the playing card between the spokes of my mind’s bicycle, turning a mental enabler into an annoying distraction? I started programming mainframes in 1974. I can still remember the excitement of possessing my own personal computer back in the eighties. I can recall the thrill of learning how to use a graphical user interface and a mouse with my first Mac. I still vividly remember downloading my CD collection to my first iPod, and being able to carry my entire music library in my pocket. And I have fond memories of installing my first iPhone apps from the online store. Perhaps most tellingly I maintained a subscription to at least one monthly Mac magazine (starting with Macworld and MacUser and continuing with MacAddict) continuously from the mid-eighties to sometime in 2018, when I finally let my subscription to MacLife lapse. In hindsight, I can see the following distinct models of computer usage that have emerged over the years, with varying degrees of… -- -- 3 Chief Practopian at The Practical Utopian Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*wnJ6P5HUPNeQLX7wvxsIVA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*w1qc2GqKHZNB4mPktjHYaA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*wnJ6P5HUPNeQLX7wvxsIVA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*w8uc-Ov8vQvLs8wRjCCg8A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*wnJ6P5HUPNeQLX7wvxsIVA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*rGGJ0ls1lfqEqXMj66Z72Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*wnJ6P5HUPNeQLX7wvxsIVA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*Q7jWUILagD1dpaP_NfewEA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*wnJ6P5HUPNeQLX7wvxsIVA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*-4vuSnlznLNDsHZTdEAdtg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*wnJ6P5HUPNeQLX7wvxsIVA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*_wvc1IOHe1qT5s7-hNm2JQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*wzwnJD8UpPtAd2YoIPEiNQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*TcF9rICJPQZsrzNignSvgw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*nChshyHhYer985FIUWu6TA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*maC8NLpto3tNwluhoRODsw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg']",3-Jan-19,https://medium.com/?source=post_page-----c16567479eb9--------------------------------,305,7 min read
2019: The Year of Privacy,"Written by Dawn Song,Users will demand privacy,Privacy regulations will become a reality,Privacy-preserving technologies become a viable solution"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Dawn Song Follow Oasis Labs -- 1 Listen Share This year saw intensifying concerns around privacy. As data collection capabilities increase and companies collect unprecedented volumes of user data, the scale, frequency, and impact of data breaches have likewise amplified. These breaches, which have degraded consumer trust and led to increased government scrutiny, are the result of inadequate data protection and insufficient restrictions around data sharing and use. As the value of data rises, it will become increasingly important to strike a balance between using data and protecting privacy. Failure to do so results in data silos, which greatly diminish the value of data for innovation and societal benefit. Emerging privacy-preserving technology can help provide a win-win solution, offering unprecedented user privacy protections while enabling new applications for data. Blockchain provides transparency but not privacy: on current blockchain platforms, transactions and data are publicly visible. Privacy-preserving techniques combined with blockchain can enable new decentralized applications that protect data while providing users with transparency and control over how data is used. These privacy-first applications will help restore consumer trust, creating a virtuous cycle that fosters development of data-driven applications. We think 2019 will see a dramatic shift to privacy-first applications, catalyzed by three growing trends that reinforce each other: an increased user demand to control their own privacy, the rollout of new privacy regulations, and advancements in privacy-preserving technologies. Data breaches and privacy violations escalated in 2018. Large technology companies including Facebook and Google came under fire for failing to protect user data, and nearly every industry — from banking to retail — suffered major data breaches. The Cambridge Analytica scandal demonstrated that business models dependent on collection and monetization of user data are a fine balancing act, often putting the interests of the business in conflict with the users they serve. The incident served as a reminder that for many internet services, there’s a tradeoff between using the service and giving up one’s privacy. These issues have resulted in a heightened distrust by the general public of organizations that collect and monetize user data. It has increased awareness of the insufficiency of current protections for data, leading many to forego the use of products and services out of concern that their data will be sold or misused. We saw signs of this trend in 2018. Campaigns such as #DeleteFacebook spread across the internet with viral speed as users began protesting companies that misuse their data; and Apple CEO Tim Cook called privacy a “fundamental human right”, raising concerns about the crisis of the “data-industrial complex”. Many signs point to a tipping point in 2019 where customers en masse will demand privacy protection and the ability to control how their data is used, and will opt-out of services that don’t provide this. 2018 saw the official rollout of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to enhance consumer privacy protection. This trend is expanding into other countries and individual states in the US. The California Consumer Privacy Act, which takes effect in 2020, is among the most stringent state-level protections, requiring companies who collect user information to use it responsibly and to provide transparency to consumers on data use. Federal government oversight in the US is already tightening and will likely result in additional regulations. In 2018 Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg were both called by Congress to answer questions about their companies’ data practices. The increasing government scrutiny and risk of huge fines will motivate other companies to be proactive about privacy protection. This shift in regulatory policies will force companies who have insufficient privacy protections to take actions. Adopting strong privacy protections will be an existential requirement rather than a luxury. For the vast majority of technology companies, whose revenue and growth depend on utilizing user data, timely deployment of new privacy-preserving solutions is essential. The good news is that 2018 saw significant progress in the research and development of privacy-enhancing technologies. Cryptographic techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption saw increased research and development activity from the blockchain community, who view privacy as essential for enabling and driving many new blockchain applications. While these cryptographic techniques are important, they are not yet practical for general applications. Zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption can be very slow, ranging from thousands to more than millions of times slower than native execution. We think hardware-based approaches are therefore critical, and 2019 will see the rise of hardware-based approaches for secure computing, including hardware-based acceleration of cryptographic techniques as well as trusted hardware. Specialized hardware such as ASICs can give a performance boost to cryptographic techniques, bringing simple applications within reach. Another technology known as trusted hardware will further expand the application domains of secure computing. Trusted hardware provides a secure execution environment called a secure enclave that allows execution of code at near-native speeds while isolating data and code from other software running on the machine, including the operating system. Trusted hardware will enable a broad range of new applications on blockchain by allowing complex workloads to execute at scale while protecting privacy. The world’s largest chipset manufacturers already offer secure enclave chipsets in products ranging from servers to laptops. In 2018 several major cloud providers began offering access to secure enclaves in the cloud, further increasing availability of this technology. Additionally, the release of the Keystone secure enclave in 2018 marks the first general-purpose secure enclave framework available as open-source. This milestone will lower the barriers for developing chipsets with secure enclaves, enable faster adoption, and accelerate research in secure hardware technology. Differential privacy is another promising technology that provides strong, formal privacy guarantees. Last year saw increased research activity in practical techniques for differential privacy. These technologies are especially potent when combined with blockchain. The data breaches in 2018 have made consumers increasingly suspicious of opaque centralized solutions. The technologies described above can add privacy to blockchain, providing an ideal combination of transparency and privacy — without relying on a central party. 2019 will be the year of privacy. The confluence of these three forces — increasing user awareness and concern, regulatory policy changes, and improved capabilities of privacy technologies — will bring privacy to the fore and usher in a new paradigm of privacy-first applications.

"Solderdoodle Plus Is the Swiss Army Knife for Soldering, Wood Burning, and More",Written by Cabe Atwell," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Cabe Atwell Follow -- 2 Listen Share Mechanical engineer Isaac Porras (from Solarcycle) has relaunched the Solardoodle Plus — a cordless hot multi-tool that can be used as a soldering iron, 3D print finishing tool, and wood burner, all in the same package. The Plus offers double the power (10-watts) over the original and features an assortment of attachments that can be utilized for any number of projects. The Solderdoodle is outfitted with a high-efficiency, high-power charge controller and uses similar lithium-ion rechargeable batteries found in Tesla electric vehicles. With that said, the hot multi-tool has an hour of work time at maximum power (5000 C) before needing a recharge; however Isaac states that regular soldering sessions only last a few minutes long, so under regular use, the battery can last weeks on a single charge. Considering that the Solderdoodle is portable and charges over USB, you can tap into just about any mobile device power source if need be — portable rechargers, laptops, or even solar chargers if they happen to be available. As far as features go, the Solderdoodle is outfitted with a touch sensor that allows you to ‘swipe’ to different power levels, which is denoted on an LED power-level indicator. A switch on the back of the tool enables you to turn the tool on or off, and includes a safety mechanism that puts it in sleep mode when not in use. It is also compatible with a myriad of different tips — chisel, conical, wood burning, needle, spade, and blade, among others. Porras is currently crowdfunding the Solderdoodle on Kickstarter with pledges starting at $99 for the tool and tip package; but, you can get just the tip package for $41 if you prefer your own soldering iron or wood burning tool. -- -- 2 Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*SjJYUdHqel-qRpR_W86lkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*M1SPMGJpLaola_Amzai70Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*Ixp8R5bHqIanhACWl_NYRw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*tR-jNXEQIlTnHDyLChWiQQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*SjJYUdHqel-qRpR_W86lkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*1NnjDc7JG2ne69On7G3x4A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*SjJYUdHqel-qRpR_W86lkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*fF_6uXS55HwxCd_kAydF2A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*SjJYUdHqel-qRpR_W86lkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*pArUSIOa_RgLQ_VjJdH37w.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*SjJYUdHqel-qRpR_W86lkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*LVPsyy_C6BJbhkxeDfoccw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*SjJYUdHqel-qRpR_W86lkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*TQlEMeYwwWc38Wqm7EfCTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*0-N4JrXpZG1KJfIrAutd3A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg']",3-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@CabeFSAtwell?source=post_page-----6b018c6bb73c--------------------------------,1,2 min read
What is Fintech? What are Some Definitions of Fintech?,"Written by CFTE,Definitions of Fintech"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in CFTE Follow Centre for Finance, Technology and Entrepreneurship -- Listen Share Fintech is changing the world of finance at a rapid scale. Here are a few examples: This brings to the question of what is fintech? The World Economic Forum defines fintech as: “new entrants that promised to rapidly reshape how financial products were structured, provisioned and consumed.” EY adopts a more encompassing definition of fintech as: “organizations combining innovative business models and technology to enable, enhance and disrupt financial services”, emphasising that fintech is not only about early-stage start-ups and new entrants, but also scale-ups, maturing firms and even non-financial services firms. In the same vein, McKinsey & Company characterises fintech company as: “start-ups and other companies that use technology to conduct the fundamental functions provided by financial services, impacting how consumers store, save, borrow, invest, move, pay, and protect money.” Similarly, KPMG defines fintech as: “a portmanteau of finance and technology” which includes (1) “businesses who are using technology to operate outside of traditional financial services business models to change how financial services are offered” and (2) “that use technology to improve the competitive advantage of traditional financial services firms and the financial functions and behaviours of consumers and enterprises alike.” Accenture states that fintech is about using technological advances to improve financial services, emphasising that: “the ‘tech’ in Fintech is the emergence of brand new technologies, such as AI, blockchain, analytics and big data.” In other words, fintech represents not only a powerful force of disruption from startups and technology companies to the financial industry, but also digital transformation within traditional financial services firms. These include the application of technology such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing and blockchain to offer superior services in sectors such as retail banking, asset management, insurance and compliance. In this age of digital transformation, mastering fintech becomes increasingly critical to have a successful career in finance. At CFTE, we have developed two executive fintech education programs designed for finance professionals, entrepreneurs, technologists and consultants to bridge the knowledge gap. Around Fintech in 8 Hours is a structured course in 16 modules that teaches the essential concepts to understand the impact of technology in finance. CFTE developed the course with 4 experts who know the industry inside out. Our co-founder and senior lecturer, Huy Nguyen Trieu, has led the Oxford fintech Programme and the HKU edX fintech MOOC. AI in Finance is the first of its kind online course that dives into the specific application of artificial intelligence in finance. In AI in Finance, you will be able to learn from those who are building AI and from those who are implementing AI. These are AI CEOs, senior leaders from banks, investors and regulators who are driving the AI agenda around the world, from the US to Europe and Asia. Join CFTE to embrace to change. -- -- Centre for Finance, Technology and Entrepreneurship Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*lumJcKwHA3PbSYD6EFaxTg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*lumJcKwHA3PbSYD6EFaxTg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*LRC34gq3Jg-wOZbZ96E1YA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*lumJcKwHA3PbSYD6EFaxTg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*lumJcKwHA3PbSYD6EFaxTg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*albK7fdrJF1aSOSh3kP0uQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*lumJcKwHA3PbSYD6EFaxTg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2tbNdgzTBchXJJq0JGJJvQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*ufiDRusHplet_lEqpzARiA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*pQiATGTrGsSEOMYSsD5JPw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*lumJcKwHA3PbSYD6EFaxTg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*yuVzMhCJyDENbyhwAsrkwA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*lumJcKwHA3PbSYD6EFaxTg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*TQlEMeYwwWc38Wqm7EfCTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*0-N4JrXpZG1KJfIrAutd3A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*iQJjezE8PMsrLMJyhgmWDA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*SSldMA8f2cLiwAZDfFFwVA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*v81PL_0CTnry3iWQHBAKpQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*-PS6oMeaJG5dRLPxg1L6PA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*ahIxB6HS49zEmm6AuHexYg.jpeg']",3-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@cfte?source=post_page-----ddffebd98c1d--------------------------------,2,3 min read
2018 MOMENTS WE ❤,"Written by TwentyFirstCenturyBrand,DIVERSITY & HARMONY,AMBUSH WITH HUMANITY,PURPOSEFUL GROWTH,COMMERCIAL CREATIVITY"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in TwentyFirstCenturyBrand Follow TwentyFirstCenturyBrand -- Listen Share 2018, what a year indeed. We opened our eyes for the first time as a company to a whole planet actively taking massive strides at being a kinder and more accepting place to live. In an effort to capture this magic our office sat down, shaking off the glow of holiday gluttony and that “one” drink on New Years, to reflect on the top moments of 2018 that deeply inspired us. Naturally, we looked inward to our very own values as the guide to our thoughts. We must admit in doing this we all had a “holy shit” moment when we realized what a prolific year it has been for us all. Here is our official 2018 review inspired by our values: We embrace all forms of diversity from ethnicity to experience. The process of building harmony can be messy but the results are powerful and more than worth it. 1.) Hollywood woke TFU to the fact that movie goers are craving stories that reflect global culture and represent difference in an authentic and somewhat epic way. Groundbreaking movies like Black Panther, Crazy Rich Asians and Oceans 8, which earned $700m, $250m and $300m at the box office respectively have finally proven that minority casts and women can deliver blockbuster returns in their own right. 2.) 2018 was the year of women in action. From #MeToo mobilizing deeper impact in every industry to Oprah’s speech at the Golden Globes to the female takeover of the Midterm elections to women driving in Saudi Arabia to the Royal Wedding of Megan and Harry we watched first after first that changed history. 3.) Culture creators used releases as platforms to speak their point-of-view not just sell albums. Meek Mill launched his new album “Championships” yet spent all his airtime talking about criminal justice reform. And the First Step Act was passed (a criminal justice reform bill). We go out of our way to create a safe space for people to be vulnerable, creative and challenging. To be themselves, not who they think they ‘should’ be. 4.) Enough is enough. The students of Parkland became the faces of their generation as they rallied a nation and actively challenged government leaders and the NRA to protect our kids. 5.) We don’t have to think the same to love the same. Obama’s speech at John McCain’s funeral showed us how we don’t always have to see eye-to-eye to love and honor each other as human beings. 6.) Commercial beauty is a cage that must be broken. Korean women and men took a public stand against the extreme cultural beauty standards by starting the “Escape The Corset” movement. Commerce is predicated on growth but not all that grows is good. We pursue growth that is sustainable for people, the planet and profit. 7.) Artist expression is limitless when you are Donald Glover. His release of “This is America” under Childish Gambino proved you can maintain creative integrity in a multitude of verticals. 8.) If we learned anything from the past 5 years…ignoring sexism and racism will completely and totally slaughter your brand. Starbucks swiftly responded to racism by closing over 8,000 of its stores on May 29 to conduct unconscious bias training of its employees. 9.) We didn’t know that butterflies could go through metamorphosis to become even more glorious butterflies until Michelle Obama. Her release of Becoming solidified her role as a cultural leader and not just the forever queen of the White House. We see creativity as a mindset not a discipline. The art is in using it to create real value, with the entire company as our canvas. 10.) One Tweet can say everything. In releasing the Kaepernick campaign Nike ran the usual playbook — beautiful film, OOH, etc — but it was the Tweet from Kaepernick that gained the most media pick-up and consumer action in both conversation and dollars spent. 11.) Community fueled show development and releases created a flywheel amplification effect for Netflix. From To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before to Bird Box you might as well live under a rock if you weren’t in on the memes. 12.) In response to Trump’s “shit hole countries” comment Airbnb focused on promoting travel to Haiti, El Salvador and Africa.

InstaGAN Excels in Instance-Aware Image-To-Image Translation,Written by Synced," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Synced Follow SyncedReview -- Listen Share Researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology and Pohang University of Science and Technology have introduced a machine learning algorithm system, InstaGAN, which can perform multiple instance-aware image-to-image translation tasks — such as replacing sheep in photos with giraffes — on multiple image datasets. The paper InstaGAN: Instance-Aware Image-to-Image Translation has been accepted by the respected International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2019, which will take place this May in New Orleans, USA. An image-to-image translation system is a system that learns to map an input image onto an output image. Unsupervised image-to-image translation has garnered considerable research attention recently in part due to the rapid development of generative adversarial networks (GANs) that now power the technique. Previous methods were not suitable for challenging tasks, for example if the image has multiple target instances or if the translation task involves challenging shapes. Last month Google AI researchers introduced a state-of-the-art model capable of realistically inserting an input object in a photo with both a reasonable position choice and an accurate prediction of the output object’s size, pose, shape, etc. The team behind InstaGAN, however, believed even this advanced method could be improved upon. This new research is based on CycleGAN, a GAN variant which can learn to translate images without paired training data to overcome the limitations of one-by-one pairing of pix2pix in image translation. CycleGAN can automatically translate two given unordered image sets X and Y, but it cannot encode instance information in an image. CycleGAN results however are not ideal when translating images involving specific features of the target. The InstaGAN system overcomes this problem and combines instance information from multiple task targets. InstaGAN combines the boundaries of the target while ignoring details such as colour. Compared to CycleGAN for image-to-image translation, InstaGAN is more successful in generating a reasonable shape for the targeted instance while preserving its original context. The research has been accepted as an ICLR 2019 Poster Paper. Reviewers indicated the method was novel and solved information problems not solved by previous methods with a clear explanation; that results looked significantly better than CycleGAN and other baselines; and called for additional controlled experiments with the model. The paper InstaGAN: Instance-Aware Image-to-Image Translation is on arXiv; and more information is available on the InstaGAN GitHub.

What Anthropologists Can Teach Tech Titans,"‘These leaders have been operating with dangerous blind spots’,Written by The Financial Times"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story The Financial Times Follow Financial Times -- Share By Gillian Tett This year, the tech giant Amazon will be engaged in a delicate political dance in New York. The reason? In late 2018, the company announced plans to base one of its two new “headquarters” in Long Island City, Queens. Amazon’s leaders probably assumed that the decision would delight locals. After all, New York mayor Bill de Blasio was so keen to lure the company that he joined forces with his arch-rival Andrew Cuomo, New York governor, to offer incentives. But local residents have not reacted as the city elites — or Amazon officials — might have expected. Instead of welcoming the new high-paying jobs, some locals organised community meetings to try to keep Amazon out. As Tania Mattos, a leader at Queens Neighborhoods United, a group that ­promotes affordable housing in the area, ­told the FT: “This deal was not for our communities and, if it’s not for our communities, we’re not going to allow them into our neighbourhood.” How should companies respond? The normal answer would be to throw money at local “charity” projects and hire a few political lobbyists.

Can Crypto Save Us from Censorship?,"of Spankchain and Centralization,Sex Trafficking and Tumblr,Written by Michael Tauberg,1. The Problem of Censorship in a Centralized World"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Michael Tauberg Follow The Startup -- 1 Share As network theory predicts, power is becoming more concentrated in our connected world. The unfortunate side effect is that a handful of entities now control our online lives. Here are a few recent examples of how this raises new problems. On Dec 17, Tumblr was the latest in a string of platforms¹ to ban adult content. The official explanation was that this would create a “safer” space for their communities. And yet, the timing of this announcement was telling. Only a few weeks earlier the Tumblr app was banned from the App Store for accidentally hosting child pornography. Besides revealing how dependent Tumblr was on large companies like Apple, it showed how Tumblr relied on the biggest platform of all — the United States government. Since the passage of the FOSTA/SESTA sex trafficking legislation² in April, any business which “knowingly” facilitates trafficking is liable for civil damages. This means that any app or website that hosts illicit material (even user-uploaded) is at the whims of what some call “a trial lawyer bonanza of overly-broad civil lawsuits”³ -- -- 1 The Startup Engineer in San Francisco.

ECC elliptic curve encryption,Written by robbie wang," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in robbie wang Follow NewEconoLabs -- Listen Share This article written by Li Jianying explains the ECC eclliptic curve encryption in a simple way. Regarding RSA’s idea of ​public-private key encryption, I thought I knew it well and I was skillful of it. Of course, RSA is not used much now, but the most famous crypto that’s based on the ECC curve for signature verification is Bitcoin. But the other day when I talked to others about the code, I was asked why ECC can be used for the signature verification, I found that I can’t give a clear explanation of it. So I did some homework to make this issue clear. First of all, we skip the topic of what ECC curve is. because I feel that it is not very helpful to understand its logic. It is better to black box it. Because we are coders, there are “types” that are very clear, and you don’t have to be afraid at all. Just say the principle, non-pseudo code, for example, I will not say the curve degree as skipping it does not affect understanding the principle. The core principle of ECC curve encryption As we discuss in the article, we assume all points are on the same curve, on which the points support a multiplication operation. Let Q be a point on the curve If the point R = Q * Q, it can also be recorded as R = 2.Q If the point R = Q * Q * Q, it can be recorded as R = 3.Q If the point R = Q * Q * … * Q, a total of n Q, it can be recorded as R = n. Q Then here comes the principle. It is easy to find R if n and Q are given. If R and Qare given, it is very difficult to find n. On this principle, then everything else is proved. Public and private keys Let’s review the principle first Let Q be a point on the curve and k be an integer Let point K = k.Q, if k and Q are given, it is easy to find K If K and Q are given, it is difficult to find k Let me show you in another way. Let G be a point on the curve and k be the private key. Let the public key K=k.G, if the private key and G are given, it is easy to find the public key. If a public key and G are given, it is difficult to find the private key. Is it a bit interesting? From here we can also see that the private key of ECC is an integer, a very large integer, not to mention Int64. In the commonly used ECC algorithm, the private key is a 256-bit integer. The ECC public key is a point, although they are usually seen as either strings or bytearray, but the private key is an integer and the public key is a point (two-dimensional coordinate). There are many applications for the ECC curve. The most common ones are encryption and decryption as well as signature verification. Encryption principle Encryption steps First set K=k.G, (public key = agreed point G to the power of private key). 1. To pass the data m, first encode it as a coordinate point M (how to encode it is your thing, such as a string, you bytes it first, then turn into a large integer, and make it as the x in the coordinate. It’s purely an example. 2. The entire random integer r 3. Calculate the point C1 = M+r.K It must be a little confusing here. There is a dot addition, and r.K, r.K is r Ks multiplied, and K is the public key. That is, point C1 is equal to r public keys multiplicated plus coordinate point M 4. Calculate the point C2 = r.G G is the agreed point on the curve, that is k=k.G (public key = agreed point G to the power of factorial private key), r is the previous random integer After the encryption is completed, it can be seen that the encryption requires a public key, and the encryption encrypts the coordinate point M into two coordinate points of C1 C2. The encryptor only needs to send C1 C2 to the other party. Decryption steps 1. From C1=M+r.K, we can know M = C1-r.K 2. Substituting K into the above formula by K=k.G (public key = private key) M=C1-r.k.G 3. Bring C2=r.G into the above equation, you can get M=C1-k.(r.G)=C1-k.C2 4. According to the conclusions derived above, M=C1-k.C2, the decrypter can calculate the encrypted coordinate point M according to the received C1, C2 and its own private key. Principle of signature verification Signature step First set K=k.G, (public key = agreed-point G to the power of factorial private key), set the signature data to m, and use the private key for signature. 1. Process the data that are to be signed: e=hash(m), e is a huge integer. The Hash algorithm does not need to be explained. m is mandatory. The ECSDA implementation also puts a coordinate into the hash to calculate the principle. I will not substitute for them, just say e 2. The entire random integer r 3. Calculate s=r-e*k. This expression is purely an integer operation. The result s is of course an integer. The s= random number minus the hash* private key. Signature completed Usually, signature (signdata) refers to two integers, s and r. The signer sends s, r, and public key K. If you want to sign the data m, anyone can check it. Verification steps, public key is used for signature verification 1. Process the data that are to be signed e=hash(m) 2. Calculate the point V1=r.G (that is, the point of the public key, the G to the power of factorial random number r) 3. Calculate the point V2=s.G+e.K (point G to the power of factorial signature data s plus factorial public key) 4. If V1=V2, the verification is successful, then prove 5. If the data is correct, then s = r-e*k is established. 6. Now set s=r-e*k, V2=s.G+e.K to expand s to V2=(r-e*k).G+e.K 7. V2 = r.G-e.k.G+e.K 8. Since K=k.G, substituting the above formula, you can get V2 = r.G — e.(k.G)+e.K = r.G -e.K+e.K 9. The above formula cancels e.K and gets V2=r.G. It can be seen that when s=r-e*k, V2=r.G=V1 10. Conversely, when V1=V2, s=r-e*k is true then the data is correct. -- -- NewEconoLabs Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*AQUQVIcZVM9r9ANv0XE6bw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*uMQfKpJaxSymP0MAT6cssw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*EH07eE7iOW873SpkPtcfLg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*AQUQVIcZVM9r9ANv0XE6bw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*uMQfKpJaxSymP0MAT6cssw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*lRbBGHJFDdp_hF0c-KguEQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*AQUQVIcZVM9r9ANv0XE6bw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*W5J0tQgyo4ucg-YsGo7FVQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*AQUQVIcZVM9r9ANv0XE6bw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*lRbBGHJFDdp_hF0c-KguEQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*AQUQVIcZVM9r9ANv0XE6bw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*vkHIIEUDqc5DJLQBi1E2pA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*AQUQVIcZVM9r9ANv0XE6bw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*xDbA7FRMcDbaRfPF.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*0JhJhaiuTdrFSCY9.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*U-gOGX5jgnqeIqeQWdkX-g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*kRjPC0wvCU4tIq6d7JU2qw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*g18CJT3HCfdNei_vCZAu0g.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*Hv9L-Bg6xodrFns9jsS5Pw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*1r77L_rUNhw7daGqkET2CQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*y1hibMV8a6syuKUohJ7_nA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*72vCHCq-8IL-3qJGiWXsLw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*fugYAVIhdrNJLL9zMNBWQw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*edEop477ut3jEIV5AsETPw.jpeg']",3-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@WangRobbie?source=post_page-----feb48340f31f--------------------------------,41,5 min read
Supernode 101: Earn Rewards Daily💎,"Everything You Need to Be a Snapshot Block Producer (SBP),Written by LKK153,1) What is a Supernode?,2) Why are Supernodes in Vite called Snapshot Block Producers?,3) Why should I become a Supernode / SBP?,4) How can I become a Supernode/SBP or full node?,5) Who are the SBP’s and how many are there?"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in LKK153 Follow Vite Labs -- Listen Share Supernodes are unique to blockchains with a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) consensus mechanism. Think of DPOS as a representative democracy, wherein the elected officials confirm the legitimacy of individual transactions and the overall public ledger. By the way, during crypto winters, running SBPs is a great way to make use of your VITE coins😁 Vite uses a variant of DPOS called Hierarchical Delegated Proof of Stake (HDPOS). This is due to our Block Lattice architecture which is a novel form of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). In HDPOS, there are multiple levels of consensus: Local Consensus: Happens at the level of user accounts and smart contract accounts. Vite’s Block Lattice DAG ledger means that each user and smart contract has its own chain. Delegated Consensus Groups are hand-picked sets of full nodes who determine the state of smart contracts. Global Consensus: Global Consensus happens at the Snapshot Chain level, through the Snapshot Consensus Group. The Snapshot Chain is an overall ledger of all chains at the Local Consensus level; though it does not store the whole ledger, it stores key information such as account balances and roots of Merkle Trees of smart contract states. The relationship between Local Consensus and Global Consensus is captured in the following analogy: a company records its financial transactions (Local Consensus) and an auditor confirms that they are correct (Global Consensus). Supernodes are members of the Snapshot Consensus Group, from which the top 100 are eligible to become SBPs💪 Snapshot Block Producers (SBP) are the top 25 voting Supernodes within the Snapshot Consensus Group, who produce blocks for the Snapshot Chain. Vite invented the Snapshot Chain to mitigate well known security issues posed by DAG architecture. To become an SBP, a node must: The top 100 SBPs with the most votes will be allowed to produce blocks and receive mining rewards. The probability for a top~25 SBP to produce a block is 23/25, and the probability for a SBP placed in the 26th~100th range to produce a block is 2/75. In total, the SBPs running over a full year will receive mining rewards worth 30 million VITE (roughly 3% of total supply). SBP rewards are divided into two categories: 1. Set up a full node. This takes 10 minutes maximum. full nodes keep the complete Vite ledger, vote for SBP’s and earn rewards unique to full nodes. Check out the full node tutorial. 2. Set up a Supernode in order to become an SBP. Be ready to stake VITE through your wallet and start the process of getting votes! Check out the SBP tutorial. Recommended hardware requirements: * Minimum of 5 Mbit/s stable internet connection is required. Take a look at our SBP list. Many of the teams have interesting personal profiles and they’re based all over the world! Many SBPs also happen to be Vuilders. For example: VINU, Vitamin Coin, ViNo, ViCat, MakingCents, Vivafi, ViteTogether, VoltLabs. Many of them give away native coins of their project to attract votes.

Thoughts for 2019,Written by Thomas McInerney," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Thomas McInerney Follow -- 1 Listen Share At the beginning of last year I wrote “Trends from 2017, Predictions for 2018” This year I wanted to focus on spaces and problems I’m thinking about. If you have a company addressing any of these topics or are an investor looking at these spaces please be in touch. Of course, all comments and thoughts are welcome. Tech is global — this was and continues to be true. Tech has become so significant that it now blends with national interests to such an extent that even autocrats are wary of tech companies. I’d heard a rumor that Jack Ma was forced to step down from Alibaba because he met with Trump before Xi Jinping. Whether that’s true or not it’s a sign of the times. Battles for dominance are playing out between nation states and it seems to be a two horse race between China and the US. Russia, North Korea and others have hacked many US institutions and attempted to interfere with elections. Softbank was caught up in the Saudi MBS scandal. The EU has been a tough regulator on US tech companies but Europe itself isn’t competitive in technology — putting it at a significant disadvantage long term. I’ve been thinking about community a lot and how technology can really improve day to day life. What makes a great town or city? One important element is safety and security. In 2018 I experienced bike theft, package theft and identity theft. Technology like Nextdoor, Nest, Ring, Bike Index, are helpful for consumers. More controversial is the idea of a social credit score in China. In the US, the police are over worked and prisons are over crowded. I’m open to local government using cameras and AI to stop crime (and actually deter it). If people are smashing up scooters, breaking into homes, spray painting schools, or breaking car windows I don’t have a lot of sympathy for them — cameras plus AI can help record, identify and catch these folks. Police should have access to world class technology tools and perhaps they’d be less prone to using force. Humans Are Underrated — I don’t see humans being replaced by robots or AI any time soon. Humans are super smart at general intelligence and their bodies are superior to any general purpose robot. But robots and AI combined with human intelligence in manufacturing or almost any other context are powerful. This is something Elon Musk was reminded of the hard way. AI+ humans can create interesting things. What if skilled laborers working on a construction project were orchestrated, scheduled and even inspected by AI and they got to keep more of the economics (which goes to the construction management companies now)? There is currently a shortage of skilled labor in the US so look for humans to be augmented and not replaced in the short and medium term. AI can make it so humans can do more advanced work and AI can also be useful in training for new skill sets. Homelessness and drug addiction are getting worse — this is straight out of dystopian science fiction. For some, drugs can be recreational or even enlightening but for a certain percentage of people they result in devastating addiction. Opioid derivatives have gotten crazy. New ideas for how to deal with drugs like legalization are being explored in various States which is a worthy endeavor. Homelessness (largly the result of substance abuse, mental illness and a housing crunch) is a hard problem which has plagued and divided San Francisco. There are some interesting new companies like WeRecover, Two Chairs, and Pear Therapeutics providing therapy online. AI could eventually be used to provide or augment therapy in the not too distant future. Building restrictions have become onerous and the construction industry is ripe for innovation. Crypto — everything is correlated in a bear market I was wrong in my prediction that there would be a flight to quality in 2018. Instead the whole sector went into a bear market including leaders like BTC and ETH (Ethereum losing an order of magnitude from its highs). Some of my friends have become Bitcoin maximalist but it’s incredibly hard to make predictions in this space other than fundamentally useful technologies are being built and important deep research is happening. Crypto is a real innovation in computer science and mathematics but the implications are far out and hard to see. Current UX is still terrible and private key management is super difficult. Scaling is still a major challenge. Institutional money is moving in but carefully. The free market works in the long term but the environment and poverty are imporant externalities that aren’t solved. Those are ideally handled by well run government but we don’t have that for the most part. Not sure what the solution is — perhaps a combination of NGOs, generational values shifting or incorporating environmental costs into free market models somehow. Young people are far more attuned to the environment than the older generation and they are demanding brands represent their values. But solving problems like climate change or plastic pollution requires global cooperation and short term sacrifice which seems very difficult. I’ve invested in Bird, Arcadia Power, Charm Industrial, JoyMode, GetAround, Opus 12 (all helpful) and want to do more cleantech investing especially in the waste stream. I was surprised to see the backlash against scooters, and it reminds me of the backlash against umbrellas when they came to England in the 18th Century. The bar for retail is way higher. Amazon has raised the bar for what consumers demand from retail by making it so most things can be bought online effortlessly. Retail has to be better than it has ever been to compete. But paradoxically the Amazon retail stores are lackluster. Los Angeles was ground zero for scooters and I think it is ground zero for some really cool new retail experiences like the Palisades Village, the Westfield Mall at Century City, high streets like Abbot Kinney in Venice and the Arts District in downtown LA. And Japan sets the bar globally for best retail and urban planning. Sears went bankrupt in 2018 and big brands may lose ground to more boutique and local retail. The best answer for retailers may be traditional things like highly personalized service and specialization versus big box chains. There is an encouraging trend away from material goods towards experiences and LVMH bought Belmond to capitalize on that trend. Pessimism has taken over not sure exactly why but a guess is rapid global change and perhaps over exposure to media. Human population has more than doubled from 3 billion in 1959 to approaching 8 billion people now. This means mind numbing traffic, long lines at airports, expensive housing, being a number instead of a name in your community, phone trees instead of human operators, etc. We can innovate around these problems but they present a real challenge. I’d like to see more studies on how screen time affects happiness and well being. People are losing faith in large institutions. Young people prefer socialism to capitalism. This is a troubling trend if true — few of them have actually experienced socialism and people should visit Venezuela or Cuba to see it first hand before advocating for it. Starving Venezuelans have taken to eating rabbits whereas most Americans get to choose how they want their latte. I’m hoping voters globally aren’t seduced by wild promises from the far left or far right and start putting the ball in the middle of the fairway again. We have real problems but this is also the best time to be alive in human history for the majority of people in the world. And things are getting better every day. -- -- 1 Angel Investor. Advisor.

The Easiest Short of 2019,"Written by Harry Sauers,Why I’m Shorting SNAP"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Harry Sauers Follow DataDrivenInvestor -- 1 Share Snap Inc, has yet to turn a quarterly profit — the stock is dogged by this fact, coupled with poor redesigns and low revenue. Stock dilution has continued to hurt current shares, 30% of which are held by insiders and another 34% by institutions. Furthermore, insiders have been net sellers across both 3-month and 12-month time frames, indicating a lack of confidence in stock performance. Ad revenue without serious deep data to back it, à la Facebook and Google, is not a viable plan for profitability. Despite 188 million users as of Q2 2018, SNAP has continually posted losses and frustrated both users and advertisers with ineffective application design again and again. -- -- 1 DataDrivenInvestor Writing about software, cybersecurity, and finance.

How tech is transforming healthcare,"Worldwide Healthcare: A Systemic Challenge,Healthcare Anytime, Anywhere,Virtual Reality Healthcare Solutions,Digitization & Miniaturization of Tech in Healthcare,Welcome to the digital health revolution | HP® Official Site,Written by Andrew Bolwell"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Andrew Bolwell Follow Megatrends by HP -- Listen Share Can you imagine a world where a tattoo on your body can track your blood sugar and heart rate? Seems a bit like an episode of Black Mirror, but according to recent tech innovations, that reality soon might not be far off. From tattooed biosensors to robot caretakers and digital pill dispensers, there are innumerable ways that tech can transform the healthcare space. However, before we explore the ways that tech can both assist and improve healthcare, we first need to examine the current and ongoing healthcare crisis, both globally and right here in America. Sadly, the problems that started over 50 years ago are still plaguing the global healthcare system today. Globally, the healthcare industry is constantly facing challenges. Did you know that one in seven people on the planet is on-the-move? That statistic equates to about a billion migrating people — a staggering number and the most there has ever been throughout the course of history. In particular, refugees and other migrants face distinct obstacles in accessing health care, including language barriers, cultural differences, unfamiliarity with local health services, and the inability to readily access quality healthcare. Their diverse needs also present difficulty; from migrant farmworkers who have been exposed to toxic chemicals to refugees dealing with the trauma of war. The global health implications of the healthcare crisis are ever-present in today’s world. #DYK about 1 billion people are migrating? That’s a staggering number and the most there has ever been throughout the course of history. Additionally, the cost of healthcare both in America and worldwide has been an on-and-off concern for years. According to a recent Wall Street Journal article, health care costs in the U.S. are predicted to reach 20 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2025. What the report failed to note was that America is now in our 50th year of the official US health care crisis — yikes! Consider this: in 1960, healthcare expenditures were $27.2 billion, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. In 2010, U.S. taxpayers paid nearly $2.6 trillion for healthcare services. This statistic means that in two generations, the burden on U.S. taxpayers has increased almost hundredfold. So, what’s the solution to this massive healthcare problem that has plagued the U.S. for five decades? You guessed it: tech is now a major player that has just come into the healthcare space and may change the course of history. One of the flagrantly glaring predicaments the medical industry focuses on is treating patients after they are sick. Currently, almost every preventive care option in the U.S. includes searching for an already-present disease or malady. It is also important to note that if a condition is found, it is (usually) already too late. If a doctor finds breast cancer, you already have breast cancer. If test results show you have pneumonia, you already have pneumonia. If you test positive for high blood pressure, you already have high blood pressure. The current healthcare system is designed to be reactive instead of proactive. So much money and time are being spent to treat problems that already exist instead of taking steps to make sure they don’t happen in the first place. The U.S. is at the forefront of healthcare and modern medicine, so it’s time that we take things to the next level; this is the time to shift from standardized, reactive and centralized care to personalized, preventative, decentralized, and democratized care for all U.S. citizens. The answer to facilitating this is simple, yet incredibly complex: we must integrate tech into our healthcare system. Technologies such as microfluidics, haptic holography, and autonomous robotic caretakers are transforming the future of healthcare from science fiction to reality. For example, in as little as ten years, robot caretakers could be caring for our elderly. Additionally, artificial intelligence has the potential not only to care for our elders but to do so in a way that increases their independence and reduces their social isolation. The power of technology is in its accessibility. With the implementation of tech in healthcare, we will no longer be bound by doctor wait times, geographic location, or office hours. New developments in tech will also aid in dealing with the rise of chronic disease and doctor shortfall, where key technologies will find diseases before they ever exist and help doctors complete their work faster and more efficiently. Digital pill dispensers deliver personalized medications; chatbots allow virtual medical care for routine questions and health concerns. These technologies have been created to solve for the shortcomings of our current healthcare system. Have you ever heard of a haptic hologram? Haptic holography creates invisible three-dimensional haptic shapes in mid-air using focused ultrasound. While still in its early days, haptic holography aims to let surgeons visually explore the insides of a human body. Additionally, researchers at Bristol University are hoping that they will soon be able to explore CT scans with haptic feedback. This technology will then allow them to feel tumors on the CT scan. Haptic holography creates invisible three-dimensional haptic shapes in mid-air using focused ultrasound. This new type of software converts existing 2D medical imaging data such as MRI and CT scans into fully interactive virtual reality images. With the haptic hologram system, doctors can view, manipulate and dissect body parts without ever breaking the skin. This software will help doctors gather a clearer picture of the problem faster, and have a better understanding of the situation at hand for each patient. Haptic holography is just one example of how tech and healthcare play nicely together. Another new tech development in the healthcare space is much, much smaller. Aptly named microfluidics, this new development is, essentially, an entire lab on a tiny microchip. These microchips can detect the presence of infectious diseases and offer point-of-care (POC) tests. These POC tests have the potential to vastly improve health care in many ways, ranging from enabling earlier detection of disease, easier health monitoring, and increased personalization, to reaching under-served and remote populations. Microfluidic technologies offer three main advantages to POC diagnostics; smaller sample volumes, lower test costs, and faster turn-around times. These advantages are increasingly being leveraged to develop POC devices to detect and diagnose a host of conditions, spanning from infectious diseases to cancer. Microfluidics reduce drug analysis time from days to mere minutes! This technology will aid in democratizing healthcare, providing real-time diagnostics and monitoring pre-existing conditions or overall general health. In the future, people will be able to test themselves to monitor their personal health. This is especially useful in countries where access to quality medical care is difficult or impossible. www8.hp.com Scientists are also working to develop nanobots, which researchers are hailing as the “future of healthcare.” These microscopic robots fitted with magnetic nanoparticles tuned to a specific field can work together to accomplish tasks within the human body. Research suggests that nanobots could be programmed to assist surgeons in complex tasks, such as passing through tiny cavities in the human body — spaces too small for even the most skilled surgeon to reach. Recent research also suggests that magnetic nanobots are also capable of transporting cells and delivering drugs to specific locations inside the body. Just like how ants stack their bodies together to reach a taller place, or how a massive flock of birds helps defend against predators, the nanobots will work together in the body to achieve their collective goal. As advances in materials and microfluidics enable the development of new and better devices, we can expect to see these new and exciting tech developments. It’s likely that we will continue to see growth in the range of POC diagnostics available, while simultaneously reducing the cost to produce them. Additionally, recent breakthroughs in 3D printing capabilities could help lead to cheaper mass-production of these incredibly useful diagnostic devices. Current 3D printers are capable of making objects of any shape, which lowers the costs of custom objects significantly. It is now possible to customize surgical-grade titanium implants with the right shape and size for each specific patient. Further, 3D-printed custom drugs may be on the horizon, which can be personalized to the patient’s specific disease or ailment and genetic makeup. From robotic caretakers that provide companionship and medication reminders to haptic holograms and microfluidics, the benefits of merging the technology and healthcare spaces are immeasurable. With these new developments, we might finally begin to resolve the healthcare crisis that’s been haunting our world for half a century. Watch this space for new and exciting (and maybe even a little provocative?) developments that occur when tech and healthcare intersect. -- -- Megatrends by HP Chief Disrupter at HP.

A new year of togetherness and opportunities,"For the love of blockchain, let’s take 2019 to the moon!,The year that went by,The year that just started,Written by Rahul Raj"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Rahul Raj Follow Koinex Crunch -- 1 Listen Share The new year is here, holding within its 365 days and 8,760 hours a ton of opportunities to change the world — our world. With this thought, I, along with every member at Team Koinex, extend the warmest wishes for 2019. I would also personally like to take a moment to thank all our users, backers and believers who stood by us throughout 2018 and because of whose blessings we are where we stand today. Since the beginning of 2018, the digital assets and cryptocurrency market has witnessed a bumpy ride. Falling prices, fewer ICOs, unfavourable regulations and many more factors have kept the true potential of blockchain technology, decentralisation and a tokenised global economy from blossoming. For India in particular, things became worse with the introduction of the Reserve Bank of India’s directive to isolate formal banking services from the entire blockchain-based digital assets industry. This was harsh, to say the least, as a few significant exchanges shut shop in India. A bearish market, unavailability of formal banking services, lack of initiatives and finally the complete absence of regulatory clarity dealt a crippling blow to an otherwise booming technology sphere. Nevertheless, at Koinex, we choose to always look at the positive side. Everyone here is focused on solutions, not the problems. We kept our innovation going and we did our best to keep the industry alive and kicking. We created India’s most loved peer-to-peer trustful token transaction network — Loop. We also introduced a peer-to-peer INR deposit/withdrawal mechanism. We added 32 coins, 72 trading pairs across 4 markets. In addition to this, we introduced India’s first crypto gifting service and conducted numerous trading contests and competitions, giving away prizes over INR 1 crore. Along with these user-focused developments, our Engineering team worked hard on a lot of behind-the-scenes components to enhance the performance of the exchange: we built a world-class trade engine which could handle a million transactions per second. We also developed a real-time messaging service, Pushman, which filled the ticker and orderbooks with data, broadcasting millions of messages every hour. On top of the development, we continuously kept improving the security on the platform, which has always been our priority. On top of all the things that we did in 2018, we laid out the foundation for our mission — making India a hotbed of blockchain technology development. We hosted our first #KoffeeWithKoinex meetup in Mumbai in December 2018 which received a tremendous response; that was enough for us to gear up and plan to hold regular meetups in every part of the country in 2019. We partnered with another blockchain company in Bengaluru and co-hosted a developer-centric hands-on workshop on EOS blockchain in November 2018. We plan to organise many more hackathons and developer conferences throughout 2019. All of these only serve as a small step and contribution in building the entire blockchain ecosystem in India! More concretely, we instated a blockchain research and development team within the organisation to study the core technology in depth and build vital pieces of infrastructure which can power the next phase of adoption of Web 3.0 applications. We inaugurated a new Development Centre in Bengaluru — the startup hub of India, and we plan to triple our workforce within the early months of 2019. This year we will work on two major impact areas: cutting-edge research and development of sophisticated technological products/solutions, and building an active community of enthusiasts and participants. This is aligned for all our activities in accordance with our mission. We are looking forward to 2019, recovering from the unpredictability of 2018. We are energised, focused and dedicated to keep delivering on our promises and executing our vision. We believe this will put India on the global map of excellence in the field of blockchain and distributed ledger technology. In this pursuit, we invite everyone — developers, entrepreneurs, thinkers, policy makers, community spokespeople and the end-consumers — to join hands in forging a path to the future. We also encourage blockchain enthusiasts who would want to join our team to check out all open positions at Koinex.

Reasons behind the decline in the sales of iPhone.,Written by Dhanush," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Dhanush Follow -- Listen Share Yesterday, Tim Cook released a letter to Apple’s investor explaining what many already knew that iPhone sales are slowing around the world and in turn, it’ll reduce the revenue for Apple’s fiscal 2019 first quarter. Tim Cook’s letter. What led to this?There are a variety of reasons to be factored but, I think that Apple overplayed its hand in raising the prices of iPhone to the extent that even loyal Apple fan like me hated. The smartphone market has begun to saturate and, the room for growth is steadily declining. Apple knew this already and, in 2017 they increased the price of iPhone touching 1000 dollars to combat the decline in the sale of iPhone. Apple got away with this cause the iPhone X brought loads of features compared to its previous model and, people didn’t care much to pay 1000 dollars to get the unique iPhone in their hand. Apple should have been confident then to increase the prices of iPhone last year to meet the slowdown in sales but, it backfired mainly cause the latest model looked same as previous models. Apple should have brought some compelling features to justify the price hike other than new color and bigger size but, the things didn’t turn out the way Apple had hoped. Even the budget iPhone XR was turned away by the people which led to never before marketing and trade in programs seen by the Apple. There are other problems too contributing to lackluster sales of iPhone but, the price is what that disappointed even the most loyal fans. Of course, Tim Cook didn’t mention this in his letter to the investors. He cited China and its economy as a prime problem. Yes, China has been Apple’s headache for years mainly cause of the decline in the economy and the trade wars which may very well increase the iPhone prices again all over. China is Apple’s second largest market after the U.S and, the things are not looking well as Trump threatens to increase the tax price of products coming out of China to the U.S including iPhone. Apple soon needs to reduce its dependence on China and needs to look other emerging smartphone markets like India for manufacturing and increasing sales. Other things that led to this decline are the cheap battery replacements and iOS 12. Even Tim Cook stated cheap battery replacements contributed to the sales decline, this combined with iOS 12 which increases the performance of older iPhone's and, people were hesitant to exchange their iPhone when they could get increased performance out of their older iPhone's by exchanging their battery for cheap and updating to optimized iOS 12. Now, you’ll be seeing a lot of negative reports about Apple but, you should know that this is not the end or doom of Apple. In the same letter, Tim Cook has mentioned that its non-iPhone business which includes services, Mac, iPad, and wearable are doing remarkably well. If you are an Apple fan like me, then be patient and keep faith cause if any company can go through this phase, its Apple. Yes, iPhone is the core business for Apple but, that’s about to diversify with its Streaming service that’ll launch soon, Augmented reality headsets and quite possibly Apple car.

Advanced technologies, functioning like “magics”, are developed based on rules and trends spotted by human beings. Today, Alibaba DAMO Academy published The Top 10 Technology Trends in 2019. We hope that by grasping the pace of revolution of technologies, we can make better use of these “magics” and be in charge of our own future. Dynamic and real-time urban infrastructure data, such as traffic, water, electricity and air quality data will be analyzed by large-scale computing platforms. The development of computing power and algorithms will foster the merge of nonstructural information such as video footages with structural information, making real-time modeling of urban simulation possible and holistic, intelligent decisions can be made. More resources will be allocated to technologies powering an intelligent “city brain” and its applications, while a city simulation model reflecting the real-time impulses and movements of a physical city can be built to facilitate the optimization of city governance. More cities in China are expected to have a “city brain” in 2019. With cloud-based speech interaction modules become standardized and affordable, people can “talk” to more and more public facilities as voice becomes an increasingly important interface. In the future, there will be at least one available interface point in our surroundings for voice interactions. As speech intelligence technology advances, real-time text-to-speech on mobile devices would be almost identical to human speech, even passing the Turing test in certain conversations, such as ones using a robotic voice to alert about delivery status. Rules and regulations need to be established to regulate the industry, to avoid misusing the technology in advertisements, harassing phone calls and fraud. For AI training in data centers, data movement between computing and memory has become a significant bottleneck. As a result, in addressing the challenge, memory-centric AI chip architecture based on the latest-generation of 3D-stacked memory technology will become mainstream. The demand for data bandwidth in AI chips will further motivate the use of 3D stacked memory, such as HBM (high-bandwidth memory) in AI training chips. In addition, brain-inspired neuromorphic computing chips will gain momentum, while researchers seek killer applications. Specialized AI chips may challenge the dominant position of GPUs for AI training in data centers. AI chips with architecture that truly reflect domain-specific features are expected to be increasingly used in edge computing. Deep learning technology has matured significantly. GNNs that combine with deep learning can link end-to-end learning and inductive reasoning together, which might be able to address issues, such as relational reasoning and explainability that couldn’t be tackled by deep learning before. Robust GNNs can function as a human brain that consists of neurons (or nerve cells), equipping machines with common sense, comprehension and cognitive capabilities. Computing architecture will be restructured to meet the demands for data centers and edge computing. In the future, computing, storage and networks should meet the request of high-throughput computing for AI development, as well as the request for low power in Internet of Things scenarios. The heterogenous computing architecture with FPGA, GPU and ASIC, along with emerging memory devices, are driving the evolution of traditional computing architecture. In the foreseeable future, the fundamental changes to computing architecture, underscored by the transition from CPU-centered general computing to Domain-specific computing driven by applications and technology, will accelerate the arrival of AI and the quantum-computing era. The fifth generation of wireless technology (5G) will see a significant increase of wireless bandwidth, enhancing the peak speed of 4G network nearly 100 times. This will speed the development of 4k/8k ultra-high-definition videos and immersive interaction based on AR/VR. With connection capability reaching billions of devices, it will enable thorough integration of communication and connection between machines. Networks will gradually evolve into the cloud or become software-based. Networks could also be segmented into multiple virtual subnets that are independent and parallel, offering dedicated virtual private networks for various applications. Additionally, with features like high reliability, low latency and large capacity, 5G networks will enable the development of new areas, such as vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems and the Industrial Internet. Biometric technology is maturing and being applied large scale. With the wide adoption of 3D sensors and integration of multiple models of biometric features, each device will be equipped with machine intelligence to see and hear the world. Biometric and liveness detection/anti-spoofing technology is reshaping people’s identification and verification, which will make your digital identity a sort of second ID card. From phone unlock, door access control to dining at restaurants, checking out at supermarkets, entering train stations, passing airport security check and seeing doctors in hospitals, biometric technology is playing an increasingly important role in making trust simpler and our daily life better. Making individual cars smarter hasn’t worked out well in the past to achieve autonomous driving. However, this does not mean that self-driving has hit a roadblock and is stuck forever. The advance of vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems will foster the development of autonomous driving. In the next two to three years, new technological progress should be seen in certain commercial areas, such as logistics and transportation, with fixed-route public transport and unmanned delivery for commercial buildings and campuses. People are more rational about the prospects of blockchain, which was once much overhyped. The deployment of blockchain applications with sustainable commercial value is expected to speed up. Along with the rapid digitization of various industries, IoT technologies will underpin the trusted mapping from off-chain world into on-chain data, and blockchain will expedite the restructuring and optimization of trusted data flow across participants to boost the efficiency of workflow and coordination. More and more blockchain applications will be seen in our daily life, such as cross-border remittances, supply-chain financing, electronic invoices and tamper-proof judicial records. As the value of “chaining” becomes more recognized, layered architecture and cross-chain protocol will become the focus of technology to scale up blockchain infrastructure. Governments around the world intend to enact/implement more stringent policies and regulations on data security. Corporates will need to invest more in protecting individual data privacy. Though cyberattacks won’t cease in the next few years, data-protection technologies will boom. Traceability technologies across systems, such as watermark, and data-asset protection technology, including advanced anti-crawlers against strong cyberattacks, will be more broadly adopted.

Of code and culture: Digital Humanities and where to find them,"In-between humanities and technology, a new field is emerging and many are still afraid to approach it,When it comes to the humanities, and specifically literature and new media, some people have already announced new land on the horizon. This is a place where metaphorical keycaps and quilts come together to enrich each other; where nobody is lame for reading classics nor for counting their words and analyzing their contents. Cue: the Digital Humanities.,Written by Marta P.,The two sides of the (academic) pond,Preparing for new explorations"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Marta P. Follow -- 3 Listen Share Even in such a broad area like the humanities, a certainty seems to float around the life and work of any graduate of such arts: anything to do with the likes of Chaucer and Wilde has hardly anything in common with code and algorithms. That is to say, tech? Not on my critical analysis of late 14th century poems. This notion has been taken for granted for a very long time, because students and professionals hardly found themselves studying on both sides of the academic pond, dabbling in both ancient writings and less ancient coding. Luckily enough, the times are a-changing. A more diverse environment in tech is slowly emerging, and this does not refer solely to more gender mix and more skin colors. Thanks to the availability of tools for the strong-willed, programming is now more accessible to people with the most variegated backgrounds. Not having a traditional technical education can now also be an advantage in new ways. To get your hands on your code editor after your head has travelled to exotic mind-lands — those of art, and literature, and linguistics — can make you approach this field with completely different eyes than your desk neighbor, because you have seen so many, and so disparate, things. And it’s there that you can accomplish the coolest feat of all: manage to see even further, build on your previous experience to discover new conceptual territories. These lands might be unruly and wild, difficult to explore, but they are also home to incommensurable treasures. The name alone suggests an opposition: the humanities, study area that represents all that is inherently art in the world, have now acquired a companion term that represents the future: digital. Using the digits. Critical analysis of literary texts can now be aided by powerful software tools that can read and synthesize books in mere seconds; we are talking amounts of books you could not read in decades. Investigative stylometry can help a great deal with authorship problems, like when the Computational Stylistic Group found that acclaimed Italian writer Elena Ferrante not only is not who she says she is — it has probably been her husband all along. Now-forgotten cities become alive from mere maps of times long gone. The miracle of word, paper, and brain on fire is given yet extra superpowers by digits. Numbers and words, binary and vocabulary, forever united. Or is it the case? It could be the case. Upon exploration of this young field, however, it seems like there is a hangup. And what could it be the hangup for such a happy party? Why, the guests, of course. Ok but what are the Digital Humanities and why do I keep capitalizing it (them)?! It’s 2018, Google it. Actually, just check out this link. It is a page that once refreshed shows a different definition. This is how uncertain these waters are. Here is my favorite, by Paul Youngman: Digital Humanities is the marriage of two areas of study heretofore considered incompatible — IT and the humanities. […] The keywords are scale, navigation, and exchange. These tools afford the humanist the ability to analyze large bodies of work on a previously unimagined scale. They also allow for ease of research/data navigation and provide an efficient means of research/data exchange. More precisely, the digital tools we all keep blabbering about is in fact the same technology you heard of when nerding out about, for example, chatbots. Data analysis, when the data is text, is the same thing. Text analysis, text mining, natural language processing that can be used to teach Siri to know whether you are saying “I want pizza” or “Remind me to call the dentist tomorrow at 9 AM” and act accordingly are all tools from the same box. However, the same tools don’t need to be necessarily used to teach robots to call you a cab; in fact, they can be as easily manoeuvred in order to find out whether Shakespeare took credit for his interns’ work or to discover the incredible colors of the Gothic novel. And this is when the Digital Humanities were born: when some humanists were like, wait a minute, I can use this. Waking up after the long frozen sleep of the AI winter along Machine Learning and stemming from it, the Digital Humanities didn’t exactly manage to catch the hype train; and that makes sense. DH (for friends) is not sparkling, is not the latest technological achievement that shines a light on the future; if anything, the light falls on our past and our present. To say it all, it might be more of a human accomplishment rather than a technological advancement. In truth, what makes DH a scary pond is the fact that it lacks an officially recognized definition; that the two sides it touches, the institutions of technology and literary academia, both look at it with uncertainty and lack of trust. And who can blame them, really? DH is a strange place. Humanists find themselves confronting distant reading tools that are thrown at them in one hour long workshops. Names like R and Python sound odd and undesirable and remind people of British comedy groups. The programming happens under the hood of tools with GUIs that can make you nostalgic of the early 2000s with their boxy looks. Or it happens in the rooms and on the desks of those who know all about text mining and sentiment analysis, and yet they do not think about its possibly Shakespearean ramifications. As Underwood suggests, there are no(t yet) real and proper academic approaches to suggest those. “The questions we try to answer are taught in the humanities. But the methods we use are taught, right now, in the social sciences and data science”. All we have is a bunch of tools and capabilities and expertise to build a fascinating, powerful machine, divided among different people who don’t talk much to each other. The problem has several different causes: not enough digital libraries are available to the curious, not enough is known of the DH to begin with; not enough is taught to graduates of both humanities and technological disciplines about one another. And why should it be done, after all? It was never really done before. The very nature of this problem is, in this way, very human. Innovation is usually very quick when it does not concern stereotypes and hard-to-lose human habits of the sort. While the tools for a deeper exploration of literary nature through a technological lense exist already or easily could, the commonplace concerning engineers and humanists normally depicts them far, far apart from each other. Categorization is, in this context, a very tall obstacle. A programmer, a data explorer, a software dweller can hardly fit the image of a poetry connoisseur. At the same time, he or she who is knee-deep into Victorian literature is not usually portrayed as possibly digitally and technologically literate as well. My wish by putting out this write-up for all to see is to send out the reminder that he or she can always, at any time, wear both shoes, embrace both worlds. And now that labels are gradually becoming obsolete, we can make them old and dusty even here, between words and digits, paper and screen. In this place, no-man’s land, work can become a lavish territory where labels do not matter more than curiosity and adventure. If you find poetry in code and linguistic codes in poetry, if you are equally charmed by papers and screens, keep looking. This is what it is all about. -- -- 3 Software developer with academic roots in the humanities.

"APEX Network, a year in review — what’s next?",Written by Jimmy Hu," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Jimmy Hu Follow APEX Network -- Listen Share 2019 is now here, but before leaving 2018 behind let’s recap a bit. It hasn’t been the easiest year for crypto — markets tumbled, sentiment slowed down, regulations tightened and the exuberance that characterized the market at the end of last year gradually transformed into a state of skepticism and reevaluation. A tough but necessary process, which is typical for every market cycle and amplified in crypto. We are going through a paradigm shift that is preparing the industry for healthier growth and more logical and structured valuation systems. In 2018 we have laid down the foundation for the days ahead. We released the early version of the APEX mobile wallet with multi-currency functionality, and at the end of November we released Phase One of the APEX Blockchain Testnet, all of which is according to our short and long-term technology development plan. Equally important is our expansion of the team and talent, which has surpassed even our own expectations and has outgrown the Microsoft offices into our own 200+ employee office. Lastly, we were through numerous awards recognized by a large number of organizations including Red Herring for our technological innovations, current success, robustness and future potential.  We leave a bearish year behind where numerous blockchain projects have found themselves struggling financially. However, we can confidently say that we have the runway and capital for continuing to develop APEX Network into the leading Blockchain technology, and to drive adoption in the enterprise ecosystem. We aim to create valuable and innovative use cases surrounding consumer data privacy, decentralized storage, and in general further use cases in “Data+AI+Blockchain”. We expect 2019 to bring us both joy and challenges. The rollout of testnet phase 2, which includes a Virtual Machine, is expected soon. Mainnet will follow in the months after. Thank you for your continued support, and best wishes for the New Year!

"Comparison of PoW, PoS And DPoS Governance Models","Decentralization involves systems that require governance models or consensus mechanisms as they are popularly known. There are a number of these governance models, each with advantages and disadvantages and some being more practical than others.,Written by Sal Miah,Proof of Work (PoW),Proof of Stake (PoS),Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS),Aelf’s DPoS"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Sal Miah Follow -- Listen Share These governance models weigh heavily as some of the most critical factors of a platform such as latency and throughput — some of the most popular governance models that every blockchain enthusiast will have heard of include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS) and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). These are the most widely used consensus algorithms in the blockchain space. This article pitches the three governance models against each other to give the reader a clear view of how these governance models compare. The concept for the Proof of Work governance model was presented in 1993 before the term ‘Proof of Work’ was coined in 1999 by Marcus Jakobsson and Ari Juels. The core reason for applying the PoW model is to deter denial-of-service attacks by requiring requesters of a particular service to do work, and in blockchain’s case, computational work, before a block is submitted. Many platforms have employed this consensus such that for one to mine a particular digital currency, they have to spend computational energy. Miners have to solve complex mathematical problems that require much energy. The first miner to solve the problem receives handsome rewards regarding the digital currency of that particular platform. This can be seen in Bitcoin’s case. ➡️Proof of Work also solves the problem of double spending in cryptocurrency. The more extensive the network, the harder it is for an individual to execute double spending because of the computational energy required to control the network. The kind of energy necessary to influence transactions in bitcoin is enough to power approximately 15 households in America; this is according to digiconomist. Herein lies a significant problem with PoW. The world is trying to go green by consuming less energy and coming up with more ways to produce green energy. The computational power required for the mining activities taking place around the world is enormous. This is against what the world is aiming for regarding energy consumption. ➡️Proof of Work’s other drawback is seen in its latency and throughput figure. They are low with platforms such as Ethereum only managing to hit a peak of 15TPS which is poor compared to the demand that the network experiences. This brings us to the alternative governance model that many developers have been using, the Proof of Stake mechanism. Proof of Stake has been the more logical option for those who want to avoid the drawbacks of PoW. Proof of Stake works similarly to PoW. However, the difference in these two consensus methods is that PoS requires the miner to own/hold/have digital currency. The amount of cryptocurrency of a particular platform owned is an indication of the stake a miner has for that specific platform. ➡️The workings of the PoS consensus mechanism are two-fold. The first method is by placing a high requirement for conducting an attack on the network. Fifty-one percent of all cryptocurrencies in that network will be required to initiate an attack. Due to most set up on these platforms, it is difficult for one source to have such a huge percentage. This, therefore, bars the greater population from initiating such an attack. ➡️The second way is through lowering the incentive for conducting the attack. If a miner is determined to attack by acquiring the required amount of cryptocurrency, then they would be attacking themselves indirectly. By holding such a vast number of cryptocurrencies, if the platform takes a hit and it affects the value of these digital coins, then the attacker also losses a similar percentage value. This mechanism discourages attackers by ensuring that there is no reward in attacking the platform. More blockchain enthusiasts are inclined to PoS as it favors the majority compared to PoW. An excellent example of why PoS is preferred is Bitcoin. Now, Bitcoin uses PoW. Miners usually have to look for powerful equipment which is very expensive to mine. Comparing that to any platform that uses PoS, what their miners require is just ownership of some digital currency and internet connection via available devices. Proof of Stake is not perfect in itself. It has certain drawbacks that can easily be exploited. It depends on the owners of large percentages of cryptocurrencies to push the platform and the cryptocurrency in the right direction. A generous nature of a vast majority is highly unlikely, as history has taught us, therefore some miners may end up being exploited to benefit the few at the top. Hacking also affects PoS governance models more than it does PoW. When hacked, a miner loses more than just their cryptocurrency; they lose their place in the platform. They cannot participate in voting unlike in PoW where miners only lose their cryptocurrency. These drawbacks led to the development of the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) comes in as a viable solution to the problems facing both PoW and PoS. Its functions are similar to that of PoS, but it is different in that it has more democratic features when compared to PoS. It is currently the governance model that most new platforms are opting for as it provides a more wholesome approach as a governance model. ➡️In DPoS, delegated witnesses are introduced. These witnesses have the power to vote on behalf of those who have elected them. The witness functions similarly to miners in platforms using PoS. In DPoS however, the performance of the selected witnesses is scrutinized such that those who underperform or who do not represent the views of their voters can be voted out, and new witnesses voted in. ➡️Stake in the platform in DPoS is similar to PoS as stakeholders have influence proportional to the number of cryptocurrencies they own. In DPoS, the threshold to become a valid voter and contributor to the platforms is lowered to levels which favor the frequent users of these platforms. Delegated Proof of Stake introduces democracy into blockchain. It is therefore only as useful as the voters within that platform. Those who are voted as witnesses dictate the direction of the platform thereby putting pressure on voters to elect those whom they see as fit to lead them to greater heights. The success of DPoS has been seen thus far in platforms such as Steem that have become prominent worldwide. It has also helped maintain decentralization in platforms where it has been applied, and it has been instrumental in fending off regulatory interferences. Furthermore, it has dealt with the setbacks of both PoW and PoS while maintaining their strengths thus leading to more robust platforms with excellent performance. ➡️ælf is among the platforms currently utilizing DPoS. Its DPoS system is essential to its entire model and purpose. ælf’s platform is a multi-chain parallel block computing network that aims to work as an OS for blockchain. The DPoS consensus mechanism was selected as it would work best with the parallel chains that are in use in ælf. In regards to user experience, the high frequency and predictability of block information that is required in Aelf will be delivered by the robust and able DPoS system. ælf’s smooth running testnet is a testament to the success that DPoS can provide.

An Argument for Staying Put — Why Job Hopping Isn’t Always the Answer,"The Downside of Pursuing Fulfillment?,Think for Yourself — Even if Your Conclusion is ‘Old-Fashioned’,The Case for Employee Retention,Why I Stayed Put,Written by Jeff Derrick"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Jeff Derrick Follow -- Listen Share I’m a bit of an oddball in the web technology world in that I’ve worked at the same institution for over 12 years. When I meet fellow techies for the first time and tell them this, for example at a tech conference, I’ll often get a surprised reaction. There’s a positive reaction at the surface (“oh, that’s great”), but also a look that conveys an underlying confusion, and perhaps even concern. If put into words, it might sound something like: “How can you stay innovative and move forward in your career if you stay at the same place for more than a few years?” Or if put into more negative terms: “You must not really care that much about your career to stick in one place that long. I’m not sure I have too much in common with you.” Take this brief exchange in the movie Office Space, between the main character Peter who’s become disenchanted with his career, and his friend Samir who’s more in the ‘just happy to have a job’ state of mind: Peter: What if we’re still doing this when we’re fifty? Samir: It would be nice to have that kind of job security. I’ve always loved Office Space, it’s humor gets at the absurdities of corporate tech jobs in a way that I haven’t come across since, plus just hilarious. But as all good comedies always do, it also points to deep and more profound questions… This exchange in particular gets at a tension in most of us, the ‘safe play’ vs the ‘fulfilling and exciting’. As the audience, we mostly identify with Peter, at how depressing it would be to stick around the same company for that long (particularly one as awful as the company that they work for, Initec). But if we dwell on this a bit more, I think most of us also identify just a bit with Samir. Does he actually have a point? I think this tension is even more of an issue in the modern/western world than it has been in the past. For those of us lucky enough to be able to take the basic life necessities for granted (food, water, shelter, clothing, etc.) we’re often thinking less about how to keep and hold onto a stable job that will supply our basic needs, and are focusing more on whether or not we’re fulfilled in our careers. This dynamic is particularly strong in the tech world. Generally speaking there are plenty of jobs that will pay the bills, and the demand for programmers just seems to be growing, which puts more and more of the power into the hands of the employee to choose a job that is fulfilling, not just whatever they can get to pay the bills. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with pursuing fulfilling work, on the contrary I feel very lucky to live in a time and to work in a field where job fulfillment can be a major factor in choosing where I work. But I think it would be a mistake to ignore the ramifications of having these choices, or to assume that there aren’t ways in which living in a culture where job fulfillment becomes the main goal can, somewhat counterintuitively, lead to us feeling less fulfilled in our jobs and careers. In his book David and Goliath, Malcom Gladwell discusses something called “relative deprivation”: Stouffer’s point is that we form our impressions not globally, by placing ourselves in the broadest possible context, but locally — by comparing ourselves to people “in the same boat as ourselves.” Our sense of how deprived we are is relative. This is one of those observations that is both obvious and (upon exploration) deeply profound, and it explains all kinds of otherwise puzzling observations. Which do you think, for example, has a higher suicide rate: countries whose citizens declare themselves to be very happy, such as Switzerland, Denmark, Iceland, the Netherlands, and Canada? or countries like Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, whose citizens describe themselves as not very happy at all? Answer: the so-called happy countries… If you are depressed in a place where most people are pretty unhappy, you compare yourself to those around you and you don’t feel all that bad. But can you imagine how difficult it must be to be depressed in a country where everyone else has a big smile on their face? A key point here is that when we’re evaluating fulfillment, we can’t ignore the values of the cultures that we’re a part of, what effects they might have on us, and that we will ultimately measure ourselves against others in our community and how fulfilled we perceive them to be. If everyone around you is moving around looking for that ever elusive perfect job, it’s natural to look around and compare yourself to them, and to worry that you’re falling behind. As with some many things, the first step to dealing with challenges like this it recognize that it exists and to acknowledge that cultures form their own values, and that those values aren’t always logical or what they’re cracked up to be. Even if the culture’s values do make sense for many people, that doesn’t mean that their values are what’s right for you. You should also recognize that you’re inevitably going to compare yourself to others, and some of the metrics that you’ll use for comparison will come from the cultures values, not necessarily what you value. In my next post, I’ll be writing about Hype & Innovation vs. Practicality in the tech world, and I’d imagine my conclusion will be much the same as it is here, the key is to think for yourself. But with a culture as strong as today’s tech world, that’s easier said than done. There are many so ideologues out there who will think you’re a dinosaur if you stay at an institution too long, or if you’re using framework X over framework Y. (or [gasp!] no framework at all!!!) There’s no doubt that job hopping is a good and sometimes necessary way to move forward in your career. Often leaving your job and moving somewhere else is the only way to get into a new field or to increase your salary to what you deserve. However, I tend to think of job hopping in this way as a ‘necessary evil’, a symptom that employers are not properly valuing their employees, or the cost associated with on-boarding new employees. In my experience, there are few things more costly than having to replace a good employee. This really hit me during a recent hiring process, where I started to realize that how long someone might be interested in staying in the job might actually be one of the most important criteria to think about when evaluating candidates. Programmers are not plug-and-play, it’s become far less important to me that a new hire knows a specific technology. For a strong candidate, the most important criteria usually comes down to: “Are they good at teaching themselves new things?” (b/c there are always new things to learn) and “Will they be happy here?” (if they are, they’ll do good work, and if they aren’t, they’ll leave for another job, and that’s expensive) In It Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy at Work Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, talk about their experience at Basecamp: At the time of publication of this book, a notch over 50 percent of our employees have been here for five years or more. That’s rarefied air in an industry where the average tenure at the top tech companies is less than two years. …Hiring and training people is not only expensive, but draining. All that energy could go into making better products with people you’ve kept happy for the long term by being fair and transparent about salary and benefits. Churning through people because you’re trying to suppress the wages of those who stay just seems like poor business. There’s a fountain of happiness and productivity in working with a stable crew… We’re baffled that such a competitive advantage isn’t more diligently sought. So, job hopping isn’t great for employers. But what about employees? The reason that I’ve stayed where I have for over 12 years is that it’s a great fit for me. My job has allowed me to develop skills in every layer of the stack, from database design, networking configuration, web server management, API development, font-end development, app development, systems integration, reporting… the list goes on and on. And contrary to what you might think, I’d argue that I would never have developed as many of these skills or developed them as deeply if I’d worked at 4–5 different places over this time period. The key for me was to stay put (and of course to work at a great place that values learning new things). All that time I might have spent in transition I was instead able to apply to learning technologies, both more deeply and more widely. And the most innovative and transformative things that I’ve accomplished were not things that I was told to do, they were areas where I had seen the same issues come up time and time again, and armed with my deep knowledge of the institution I was able to propose the right solutions that were often against conventional wisdom or the industry standard. These are things that I would have never been able to accomplish without the years of trust that had built up, or my detailed understanding of how the institution worked. So the next time you get that sinking feeling like you’re ‘falling behind’ for some reason, remember that the tech world is a bit of an anomaly, it’s always changing, is relatively young, and it doesn’t always have everything right. For me the right choice was to stay at my job and move forward in my career in-house, but maybe you do need to change jobs, maybe you should learn that new technology (you should never stop learning!). But whatever the decision, remember that you can come to a different conclusion than the conventional wisdom, in fact that might actually mean you’re on to something great. -- -- I’ve worked as a full-stack developer for 15 years at the MIT Sloan School of Business, with particular interest in organizing systems/data to create simple UIs Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*zydGhkAhrXtfnVBNYQ3KUw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*bODqUg-hULOT5dJIDl2PYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*zydGhkAhrXtfnVBNYQ3KUw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*h3jU_5mpXVygXxYNOuYfwQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*zydGhkAhrXtfnVBNYQ3KUw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*SSfoyL6fadZSRAlF', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*zydGhkAhrXtfnVBNYQ3KUw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*hw55WTeRpGmyE6602SrfSg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*zydGhkAhrXtfnVBNYQ3KUw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*g6tmZextTyVmuPGHBz0vBQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*zydGhkAhrXtfnVBNYQ3KUw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/0*PQUdHX2K_2oVR4d9.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9BKCYE5U6gCFzALTs4pDXA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/0*-UfU52-yX8aq7Kyz.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*nChshyHhYer985FIUWu6TA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*maC8NLpto3tNwluhoRODsw.png']",3-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@jeffderrick?source=post_page-----baf48c999a69--------------------------------,91,7 min read
"Remote Work, Outsourcing, & Mexico’s IT Boom","Written by Mari H,Changing Languages,Learning from Giants,The IT Boom in Mexico,Looking Ahead"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Mari H Follow CodersLink Agency -- Listen Share Here at CodersLink, we work in an industry that is moving and changing at a phenomenal pace. The nature of the work, the languages used to create the work, the creativity in the field make for an exciting industry bursting with possibilities. Part of our mission here is to connect growing U.S companies with experienced and vetted developers south of the border. This means we’re on the frontlines working with developers and company managers as they navigate the changing landscape of hiring, outsourcing, and the developer universe. About this time last year, we were exploring some new technologies to watch out for. A year ago some of the most popular programming languages included Rust, Smalltalk, TypeScript, Swift, and Go. These were languages that are loved by programmers but might not have the highest demand. The most in-demand languages at the end of the last year based on data from job boards were Java, Python, JavaScript, and C++. Today, these languages remain on the top of the list, although the order has been slightly altered. According to various sites, the programming languages that are coming up for 2019 include Python, Java, and JavaScript. It seems Python has moved up in rank. Companies are often skeptical of the benefits of outsourcing tech roles but the truth is that many companies today — including today’s leading giants — have used outsourcing because of its cost-effectiveness and array of other benefits. Some of these giants of course include Google, Facebook, and Apple. As a hiring partner, we are deeply entrenched in Mexico’s tech community that has now gained world notoriety. Cities like Monterrey and Jalisco have seen a blossoming of young, energetic, and creative developing talent coming out of the most prestigious educational institutions of the country. We have built relationships with many of these eager developers and have found them homes working for growing U.S companies looking for specialized talent to bring diversity of thought to their workforce. The talent coming out of Latin America has several benefits for U.S companies including the fact that many developers exceed in languages like Python and have expertise in mobile development. In addition to their technical excellence, outsourcing talent from places like Mexico has added cost-effectiveness, cultural connections, geographical proximity, and versatile workers. We are looking forward to continuing our mission to helping mutually beneficial relationships form between thriving U.S companies in need of IT talent and developers eager for opportunities to use their skills, knowledge, and coding chops. We look forward to learning and growing with this exciting industry. -- -- CodersLink Agency Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*apOkrsEvPUPlhVNo9kGnJQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*ejtqCfbj7IazJ2ometMwVg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*Y-K4bpH1IXEua6hcshfESw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1500/1*uHF-IR2NTSdSstBsKSLR_w.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*apOkrsEvPUPlhVNo9kGnJQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*ejtqCfbj7IazJ2ometMwVg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*on2R3u7xY9sWn_jxmYgiPQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*apOkrsEvPUPlhVNo9kGnJQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*YWBMTH60O7jGXAKnFfZlHQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*r5hhZpMXB2v53cBdQOcYEQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*-qVaxJYX_2CjjVXF7_r-Gg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*DOBSPTHdazwZPkewiqESIQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*3wRhJEIKbeRojCcLIE5S5Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*apOkrsEvPUPlhVNo9kGnJQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zPtGTCNOwu1p3kzn_sZFVQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*kQIvhDkl0ixPpv4z', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*ERYx0IB1pN-5ZX98cKAoUw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*gzCeWxDtGmD23QR5', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*di4WDrnS1F6_p9GWnxvPmg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PzJLbFrFtNkqPsxielO8zA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*nChshyHhYer985FIUWu6TA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*maC8NLpto3tNwluhoRODsw.png']",3-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@m-coderslink?source=post_page-----acf668e239f4--------------------------------,1,3 min read
Wireless Kindle Footswitch,Written by Jeremy S. Cook," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Jeremy S. Cook Follow -- Listen Share Reading on ePaper display is generally a pleasant experience, but what about if you want to use it to store sheet music? This may be a convenient storage method, but when playing music takes up both hands, it’s a bit inconvenient to reach over and swipe the screen. To help his musician brother out with this conundrum, hacker “mosivers” came up with a wireless foot pedal for turning pages. He first attempted to spoof a capacitive input on the Kindle’s touchscreen, but after some initial success, he found this method to be impractical, and decided to instead go the Wi-Fi route. This involved first jailbreaking the Kindle, then installing several pieces of software and creating a page flip script to be executed remotely. After all of that preparatory work, it was time to build the physical unit. It uses a NodeMCU ESP8266 dev board to generate a web server, which allows for linking between the two devices without any intermediate Wi-Fi connection. The programmed board was then secured in an enclosure in order to hold up repeated toe taps, with a pair of buttons used for changing the page. While this hack is meant for musicians, mosivers notes that it could also be useful for those with disabilities, or even for those who simply find hand swiping inconvenient. -- -- Engineer, tech writer, content creator, maker of random contraptions for fun and profit.

The Habitual Programmer,"Where is a Habitual Programmer?,Who is a Habitual Programmer?,I’ll do you one better-Why is a Habitual Programmer?,Written by AAYUSH JAIN"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in AAYUSH JAIN Follow The Habitual Programmer -- Listen Share Habitual Programmers are a rare breed and are only found in places which fulfil two criteria — availability of high-speed internet and the lack of human interaction. They are almost always accompanied by their best friend — their laptop! All throughout history, there have been numerous search operations to find these rare, mysterious creatures. The desire for a peaceful environment has forced these entities to hide in the dark corners of the world. So, these habitual programmers are now considered to be nothing but mythical creatures found only in the virtual dimension. Okay. Now if you believed any of that and are probably thinking that you can never be a habitual programmer (or perhaps if you’re thinking of how foolish this all sounds), here’s some good news — Habitual Programmers are all around you. You can find them in your class in the form of that classmate who completes his programming assignment without fail. You can find them in your office in the form of that colleague who is always on the lookout to learn new programming concepts. Heck, you can even find them in your nearby park enjoying the beauty of nature (and perhaps thinking about how to debug their code). To cut to the chase — they are everywhere! “I’m not a great programmer; I’m just a good programmer with great habits.” ― Kent Beck Before describing who is a Habitual Programmer, let us understand what is a habit. Habits are the small decisions you make and actions you perform every day. To in other words, a habit is a routine or a behaviour that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously. Now, a Programmer is someone who is not only capable of writing code or building and designing software, but someone who desires to learn about new techniques, has the ability to think outside the box, knows how to communicate effectively while not compromising on his physical and mental well-being. Thus, a Habitual Programmer is simply a person that relies on small achievable habits to constantly improve his programming proficiency. A Habitual Programmer is successful not because he is a programming genius but because the accumulative effect of his small habits morphed him into an individual capable of achieving massive results. Last year, my New Year’s Resolution was to improve as a Programmer. I started the year with my fuel tank filled with motivation. For the first week, I did everything-I started doing projects, started taking MOOCs and started going to meetups. Everything went great for the first week. The following weeks were a disaster as I felt exhausted and gave up on my resolution altogether. Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going. This year, with the experiences of last year, I have again decided to embark on this journey of improving as a programmer. If you’re on the same boat and want to improve as a programmer, remember that improvement is a marathon and not a 100m sprint and you cannot expect to keep moving ahead with motivation as the sole fuel to push you forward. Habits are what you do repeatedly. These repeated actions mould your identity as a Programmer and as you start feeling more confident about your skills, the more likely you are to continue on the journey of improvement. If you ever think that Programming is difficult or that you are not meant for this field, you will appreciate the concept of Habitual Programming. You will see that with deliberate practice and minor adjustments in your behaviours to remove the bad habits and replace them with good habits, you will soon be able to exponentially increase your programming skills. Through The Habitual Programmer, I wish to help you build the necessary habits to slowly but significantly improve your programming skills. Small habits aimed at bringing about a 1% increase in your proficiency could compound over time to bring massive change. After all, we are a product of our habits. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit. -- -- The Habitual Programmer .values( ) Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*CkfEH5oDmLoN6b3b1g0dww.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*vcURCCTpgpPjrEToFJrD5g.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*MYkZSs8CEi33TbTHFRbeSQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*CkfEH5oDmLoN6b3b1g0dww.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*vcURCCTpgpPjrEToFJrD5g.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*W0lLXeZt3FW8fJ3O', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*CkfEH5oDmLoN6b3b1g0dww.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*UexXb4idvGleoVFmEI_yRQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*CkfEH5oDmLoN6b3b1g0dww.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*MAM4kKtvN8WtNb8grxS4_A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*CkfEH5oDmLoN6b3b1g0dww.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zPtGTCNOwu1p3kzn_sZFVQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*kQIvhDkl0ixPpv4z', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*ERYx0IB1pN-5ZX98cKAoUw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*gzCeWxDtGmD23QR5', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*di4WDrnS1F6_p9GWnxvPmg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PzJLbFrFtNkqPsxielO8zA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*niQ0sAwUszuyNMyH.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*pZPMtIONqtJYi2xHYD_Ivg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*nChshyHhYer985FIUWu6TA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*maC8NLpto3tNwluhoRODsw.png']",3-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@patni.aayush1998?source=post_page-----42c013153088--------------------------------,2,3 min read

Israeli AI device ‘watches’ swimming pools to prevent drowning accidents,"Two months after they started developing the product, two ten-year-old girls — Coral Sheri and Or Koren — drowned in a private swimming pool in Savyon. The company was named in their memory.,BY EYTAN HALON,Written by The Jerusalem Post"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in The Jerusalem Post Follow Jerusalem Post -- Listen Share As winter gradually gives way to spring in the coming months, Israeli families with private swimming pools will slowly start dreaming of enjoying a refreshing splash once again. While for the vast majority, pools provide a way to cool off from the summer sun, 2018 was overshadowed by the tragic increase of children and adults who drowned at home. After unsuccessfully searching for a drowning detection solution for his own private pool, entrepreneur and homeland security expert Eyal Golan partnered with computer vision specialist Dr. Tamar Avraham in 2014 to establish Haifa-based Coral Drowning Detection Systems and prevent the tragedies that strike dozens of Israeli families and many more worldwide every year. Their first-of-its-kind, patent-pending Coral Manta system constantly “watches” and detects movement in private pools using a built-in underwater video camera, computer vision and artificial intelligence technology. When it identifies a potential drowning situation, it sounds an ear-piercing alarm and immediately sends a smartphone alert to all household members. “When we started developing Coral Manta, we had three major principles in mind,” Golan told The Jerusalem Post. “It has to be affordable, it has to be very reliable and precise in detecting real events, and it has to be a plug-and-play system. All you have to do is mount two screws on the corner of the pool and the system is stable and safe.” Two months after they started developing the product, two 10-year-old girls — Coral Sheri and Or Koren — drowned in a private swimming pool in Savyon. The company was named in their memory. The company harnesses the latest deep learning technology to ensure maximum detection rates and very few false alarms, in a similar manner to advanced surveillance technology and self-driving vehicles. In this case, however, movement must be detected underwater. “In surveillance cameras, the technology assumes that the surroundings don’t move,” Avraham said “But the water moves all the time. We had to develop ways to notify the user if the water becomes cloudy, and add other sensors to operate in the dark.” The system primarily relies on solar power, operates 24/7 and has undergone rigorous testing to ensure it is fully waterproof, resistant to swimming pool chemicals and can withstand both soaring summer temperatures and freezing winter weather. The detection technology was tested, the company says, in thousands of scenarios simulating both child and adult drowning events, in a wide range of swimming pools. Contrary to popular belief, drowning is usually silent and undramatic. “Of course, no system — especially when working with a single sensor — can offer 100% protection,” Golan said. “Even at airports and borders, you typically have layers of security as all systems have their flaws. It’s the same thing with pool safety. Coral Manta is not meant to replace adult supervision, but to fill the gap when you are distracted and compensate for our human flaws.” While medical professionals believe irreversible brain damage starts to occur after approximately five minutes without oxygen, the Coral Manta alarm system starts working within seconds to enable quick assistance and resuscitation if needed. Other pool alarms currently on the market aim to prevent unauthorized access rather than operating when people are actually using the pool. Most drownings occur, however, when access to the pool is allowed. “Coral Manta is the most important safety layer ever created for the private pool environment,” said Golan. “There are simply no drowning detection systems for private pools. Those for public pools assist lifeguards, and there are so many false alarms. For residential pools, this is the only drowning detection system available.” The company is currently expanding their global reach through distributors in Australia, the US and other countries. Priced at $2,000, customers can also order the product online through the company’s website.

Peering Through The Lens: From Seed To Growth,Written by Salone Sehgal," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Salone Sehgal Follow -- Listen Share The end of the year is a great time for reflection. These are a combinations of learnings and observations garnered from being on both sides of the table across various life cycles of tech companies. Over 10+ years of looking outside-in as an investment banker, advisor, mentor, now early stage VC (focused on interactive entertainment/gaming) and as a complete insider incepting, building, operating and even winding down a company. The most important learning has been that nothing compares to the journey of an entreprenuer. As an investor the experience of having been a founder helps hone into insights, instincts and intellectual muscle that perhaps ordinarily may not have developed. And hopefully, the empathy for founders balances the pontification of an investor.

Jim Kelley x Kelley Automotive Group,Written by Andrew Hennessey," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Andrew Hennessey Follow -- Listen Share Jim Kelley is the Executive Vice President of the Kelley Automotive Group. He graduated from Indiana University in 2000 with a BS in Marketing and Entrepreneurship. In his free time, Jim enjoys playing golf and raising his three kids, Cate (10), Thomas (8), and James (6) with his wife of 14 years Joey, who is also a Kelley Business School graduate. Before getting involved with the automotive side of the family business, he worked in his grandfather’s grain trading company based in Eastern Europe. While there, Jim received a MSc in International Trade and Transport. Give us an elevator pitch about your company. I work in our family business, Kelley Automotive Group, that was founded August 21, 1952. We will never forget that date because my grandfather bought his first car dealership the day my dad, Tom Kelley, was born. We are based out of Fort Wayne, IN and currently operate 8 dealerships in the Fort Wayne area that sell 10,000 cars a year. We sell new BMW, Cadillac, Volvo, Buick, GMC, Chevrolet, Ford, Dodge, RAM, Jeep, and Chrysler brands. What are some exciting projects that your company is working on right now or in the future? Currently we are embarking on the largest project our company has ever seen. Four of our dealerships (BMW, Volvo, Cadillac, and Buick GMC) will be relocating over the next three years to a 50 acre parcel of land on the corner of Indiana 14 and I-69. This $50 million project will include a state of the art Body Shop and Detail/Accessory center as well. We start construction January 2019 and will be completed with all four stores by the Fall of 2021. Why did you want to pursue entrepreneurship/business? What are some highlights of your efforts? I grew up always wanting to work with my dad and grandfather. I remember as a kid going to dealer events and watch my dad and grandfather interact with other dealers and management from the manufacturers. I would see how much they enjoyed what they did and I wanted the same. When you were a student at Indiana University, what were some useful entrepreneurial resources or experiences? I felt going through the Kelley School of Business was in itself a great learning experience. Many of the classes, especially the I-Core semester, taught me to work with others. Up until then school was on an individual basis and during I-Core, a major portion was spent in a team environment. Same for what I do today, I always rely on a team to succeed. Whether it’s the service, sales, or parts team, we all work together to reach our individual and department goals. What are other useful entrepreneurial resources or experience outside of the University? Spending time right after graduation working for what I consider one of the best entrepreneurs I have ever met, my grandfather. I spent four years working at our family’s grain trading company, Trans-Oil, that was based out of the Eastern European country, Moldova. Starting in the mid 1990’s my grandfather took an opportunity of trading a small amount of grain, 3–5,000 tons to over a million tons of grain a year. In addition, working with my dad has taught me so much not just about the automotive business but business in general. What’s was your favorite failure or learning experience? Time kills deals. There were a few times early in my career I would procrastinate on a deal and quickly learned that to be successful I needed to take advantage of the opportunity right away. What’s the best advice you’ve received in your career? Surround yourself with the best people possible. We work in a business where all manufacturers make great product and it really is people that make the difference. What advice would you give to students interested in entrepreneurship? Have confidence in yourself and get real world experience. Although we don’t operate the grain trading company anymore I’ll never forget my experiences from that business which I still incorporate today. ​ Where can people find you in-person? Online? I’m in my actual office at Tom Kelley Buick GMC a few times per week, but I am mainly working at our different locations. I am on Instagram and on LinkedIn.

"A.I. Apocalypse Averted, Again",Written by Nathan Allen," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Nathan Allen Follow -- Listen Share Second Law of Thermodynamics, Kim Cattrall, and Chess-playing Midgets all in one essay. They said it couldn’t be done. Maybe it’s me, but when I see something like: I can’t help but think that’s but one part of the story, and maybe not even the most important part of the story.[1] This chart is of one output — but what about the other inputs and outputs? Generally, ML and particularly neural nets are ravenous beasts. Inputs include large amounts of data and hefty doses of power. This may seem trivial but recall than when the world went crypto-crazy a year ago, entire countries noted the power-usage spikes. That’s loads of powerful GPUs causing energy spikes on a national level. It’s not trivial. (This reminds me of Obama’s big EV push that established committees to review grid/power issues but no significant power-infrastructure investments — that’s how you knew they weren’t serious. Millions of EVs on the road … .where was the power going to come from?) Anyway, compared to humans, computers are remarkably inefficient — with both data and power. Humans can supplement inadequate data with imagination (I suppose one could draw an analogy to regressions, but computers fill-in-the-blanks poorly compared to humans and still require much more data). And the human brain is remarkably energy efficient. And what about the other output? Computers are entropy machines (physics-entropy, not computational-entropy, though that too).[2] They produce outputs per the graph (e.g. that’s a cat on a unicycle), and they produce heat. The thermal output of A.I. processes is not trivial. Further, as A.I. goes local, you localize these inefficiencies, which is why we have liquid-cooled chips in mobile phones now. More A.I. = more energy = more heat. And while chips have gained efficiencies all around, we’re getting to the limits of physics with 7nm chips (to the point where some fabs don’t even think producing at 7nm scale is worth doing). Ubiquitous and good AI depends on increasing efficiencies over the next decade to at least the same degree we’ve increased them over the past decade (probably more). Energy storage will likely improve, but I suspect we’re being unrealistic in assuming massive efficiency gains in other areas using the same technological architectures. Which brings us to the A.I. apocalypse. Humans are remarkably energy and data efficient, not to mention decent thermal regulators. But more importantly, humans make their own energy. This strikes me as a fundamental flaw in any “A.I. apocalypse” scenario, apart from a robot that has its own micro-nuclear reactor. AI requires non-trivial amounts of external power and produces non-trivial amounts of heat. If a robot goes crazy, you can almost certainly locate it and unplug it. What about a distributed apocalypse wherein bots seize the grid? Ok, unplug the grid. There are actual physical wires, you know. So you can’t watch Housewives of Burma for a few weeks while we kill the bots. We’re talking about an apocalypse here. But won’t we need energy just to kill the bots? No, you’ll need an ax and maybe electrical gloves. Salt water may be handy, too. But if we did require electricity, we can power off of localized/non-grid energy sources. What about bots seizing a solar array? It would need to be a giant solar array, and by giant I mean easily targetable. Unplug it. Destroy it. Attack in early morning while the bots sleep. (Tesla’s Powerwall house battery tends to nearly no power in the early morning after powering the house through the night but before the sun re-energizes it, and this is in sunny climes). Combine the inefficiency of solar with the inefficiency of computers and I like our chances. If all else fails, humans can run into the woods, eat berries, and plan their revenge. Bots gotta stay plugged in. Strikes me as a strategic weakness.[3] Humans win again. Ultimately, we just like to ponder a human-level A.I. because humans want to be gods, and you become a god by creating humans. This story is as old as history; Ovid told the story of Pygmalion in Metamorphoses two thousand years ago, and he didn’t even invent the story. (Pygmalion creates a statue that comes to life.) Mary Shelley (Frankenstein) and George Barnard Shaw (Pygmalion) followed up. As did Disney (Pinocchio), Broadway (My Fair Lady), Kim Cattrall (Mannequin) and nearly every Sci-Fi drama made. The idea that humans become gods by making “humans” is ancient.[4] Honestly, some of these examples seem more realistic than a distributed Alexa attack that compels humans to listen to unwanted weather reports. That said, nuclear drone submarines strike me as problematic. ******************************************************************* [1] From MIT Technology Review. https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612582/data-that-illuminates-the-ai-boom/# [2] I know … what about the curious case of quantum cooling/data deletion … well, we’re a long way from that having a practical application (long way = never). https://phys.org/news/2011-06-quantum-knowledge-cools-entropy.html [3] Throughout history, if you don’t have a source of fuel, your quest for domination quickly crumbles. (Fuel = food for humans and whatever for your horses or tanks or GPUs.) [4] Daedalus installed his voice into statues — sound familiar? Hephaestus famously made human-robots. Pandora was made from clay, and Talos made a man-robot out of bronze. All these stories are “B.C.” Of course, Amazon’s ‘Mechanical Turk’ is derived from an 18th century scammer who put a chess-playing midget in a box (seriously) to operate a robot. It’s noteworthy that the Mechanical Turk fooled people for years because they wanted to believe that humans could rise to god-level. That’s some serious Enlightenment-delirium. Of course, we’re still afflicted by it. About Nathan Allen Formerly of Xio Research, an A.I. appliance company. Previously a strategy and development leader at IBM Watson Education.

Innovate to Elevate by Thirdy Bon Ozarraga,"About the author:,Written by Shiela Manalo"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Shiela Manalo Follow John Clements Lookingglass -- Listen Share Do you ever wonder how successful companies start their thought process in creating products these days? I’ve always been fascinated by how they think and what drives them to create and innovate. How is it that they see things most people do not? What might seem mundane to us could seem profitable to them. What can we learn from how they think and how they see the world? One of the innovators I look up to is Casey Neistat — an American film director, producer, and popular YouTube creator. He said, “If the reason why you’re doing something creative is to make a living, then you are doing it wrong. You get into it because it’s your passion and it’s something that you really believe in.” What I got from this is that the art of innovation starts with the aspiration to make a difference as opposed to profitable gain. Creating purpose means that you can and are changing the world. However, if you do happen to change the world, you would also likely be earning from it. But if it’s the other way around, if you start off with the sole desire to make money, you probably won’t make money — you won’t even change the world. The truth is, you would likely fail. So, determining how you can find meaning and how you can change the world would greatly increase your chances of success. Let’s take a look at some of today’s leading innovators and how their products made a difference — Apple, Google, and YouTube. Apple wanted to make computers accessible — they wanted to bring computing power to everyone; Google wanted to make information available to everyone; and YouTube wanted to enable people to create videos and make it easily available to everyone. These companies started by wanting to make a difference. Today, they are already very successful in their respective fields and are changing the world as we know it. Another lesson we can learn from innovators is the ability to see what others cannot and be the first to jump the curve. Let’s have another look at two successful startups in history — Uber and AirBnb. These companies have revolutionized the fields of transportation and travel by harnessing the power of technology. How? They simply saw the idea of “sharing” and how it could take over their industries like nobody ever did and capitalized on it through the use of available technology. They have challenged traditional industries through the apps they have created and have since reduced customer journey steps, making everything easier and faster. These tech titans, now recognized as “killer companies”, radically changed the game and are now changing the world. It’s a matter of perspective — not getting stuck in a stagnant or comfortable state by being smart and finding better ways. I guess most successful innovators are not waiting for progress; they are a little bit forward-leaning by trying to make progress happen. To create is to innovate and to innovate is to improve what’s already been built. In a time wherein there’s already someone, somewhere who has created what you thought was unique, you have to see things in a different perspective in order to be successful. Have what it takes to be a creator — find an idea and build on it. Once you find your passion for creating, who knows? You could be the next big content creator or CEO of a startup company! Just make sure that you take that first step towards your goal. Please visit and join the John Clements Talent Community. Thirdy is a 27-year-old extroverted introvert and adrenaline junkie. He has an interest in both music and sports, particularly in extreme sports such as surfing, skimboarding, and skate/longboarding. He is, primarily, a lead guitar player, but he also plays several musical instruments like the ukulele, clarinet, piano, bass guitar, and some percussion. Aside from these, he is also passionate about content-creation in social media — he considers himself a frustrated photo/videographer. He travels and creates content for his Instagram page and YouTube channel on a regular basis. His close friends would describe him as the quirky, crazy, and daring one in the group, mainly because of the mantra he lives by — “Life is too serious to be taken seriously, so never stop playing…or you’ll get old.” Upcoming Event: (Click here to find out more) -- -- John Clements Lookingglass Editor|Writer|Graphic Artist|Video Editor|Musician Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/2*thyg1t0M8qAyTc88_yPjaw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*Sl0YyQ9d4hmd2gxE-zSe0Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*c3RczPiBljS64A9Q4ORffw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*vJ8-7ZRQo3idkmTkEtLHTg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/2*thyg1t0M8qAyTc88_yPjaw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*Sl0YyQ9d4hmd2gxE-zSe0Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*mIq5d2gPazclJXxFNRmRUg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*thyg1t0M8qAyTc88_yPjaw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*YoUSsvNE1ZGSkEH59HjSug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*thyg1t0M8qAyTc88_yPjaw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*BNoaOy0Lkvi9xFHpjYyFwA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Vxqkp86J0w9NuEjS8-DNhg@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*V8UcAs1HwUljjtBrzVsoYg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*thyg1t0M8qAyTc88_yPjaw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*aPC5uSF9QL_gK2GHaLdaGQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*kEDs2mHP8vRChCdHZm45hg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*CmwMXTw3MRQVt154K074ew.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg']",3-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@iamsimone02?source=post_page-----93c2829dae59--------------------------------,0,4 min read

In Advance of the CES Trek,"This story is published in The Startup, Medium’s largest entrepreneurship publication followed by +406,714 people.,Subscribe to receive our top stories here.,Written by Leor Grebler"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Leor Grebler Follow The Startup -- Listen Share This will be the first year in many (maybe 5+) when I don’t intend to be at CES. I’m looking forward to it! CES gets close to 200,000 attendees and thousands of exhibits spread out over multiple venues. My first visit, the wait for the taxi line was over an hour even though the ride was 12 minutes. The wait to get out of the cab at the venue was another 10 minutes. Fortunately, Uber has cut down the wait time and it’s maybe 30 minutes to get from the airport to the venues. Of course, getting between the main venues can also be a wait. For the five minute drive between the Sands Expo and the LVCC and the one time I decided to take the shuttle, it was over an hour to get from point to point. Walking for about 30 minutes door to door is the most reliable way. I had seen nearly a 6x Uber surge in between meetings. Over time, I learned how to pack lighter for CES and hone the schedule. Here’s some distilled knowledge: Last year, I had 30 meetings setup over 36 hours and either I or the other party was late about 70% of the time, cascading into being late for the next meeting. Follow up from CES can also be difficult. You wait a few days for everyone to get back home and then the excitement of whatever was presented in the meeting is muted. There are some things that are good at CES: If you do go, stay safe, hydrated and make sure to bring lip balm… the desert is dry. -- -- The Startup Independent daily thoughts on all things future, voice technologies and AI.

งาน Chiang Mai Maker Party 2018: แหล่งเรียนรู้หลากสิ่งประดิษฐ์,Written by ALITTLEPIG27," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in ALITTLEPIG27 Follow UP-Creative and Maker Club -- Share ประสบการณ์การได้เข้าร่วมงาน Chiang Mai Maker Party 2018 ที่ผ่านมา งานนี้เป็นงานที่รวมเอาเหล่าชาว Maker ทั่วทั้งประเทศมารวมตัวกันเพื่อแสดงสิ่งประดิษฐ์ของตนเองเพื่อเป็นแนวคิดให้ผู้อื่นสามารถนำไปต่อยอดได้ ซึ่ง Maker เหล่านี้ก็มีมาจากทุกสาขาอาชีพไม่ได้มีแต่เพียงนักเรียนนักศึกษาหรือคนที่ทำงานเกี่ยวกับนวัตกรรมสิ่งประดิษฐ์เท่านั้น การจัดงานนี้ถือว่าดีเลยทีเดียวเป็นการเปิดโอกาสให้คนบางกลุ่มที่ไม่กล้าที่จะแสดงผลผลงานตัวเองที่อาจจะเกิดจากการคิดว่าเป็นเพียงของเล่นชิ้นเล็กๆง่ายๆไม่กล้าที่จะนำมาแสดงให้ใครต่อใครเห็นเพราะอาจจะมีคำวิจารณ์ต่างๆนานาจนเกิดความไม่มั่นใจ ได้สามารถนำมาแสดงให้ Maker คนอื่นได้ชมได้ร่วมเล่น งานนี้สิ่งประดิษฐ์ที่ Maker ทุกคนได้นำมาแสดงนั้นไม่ได้มีการแข่งขันหรือวิจารณ์แต่อย่างใด ที่ยิ่งไปกว่านั้นก็ยังเป็นการเปิดโอกาสให้เด็กๆหรือแม้กระทั่ง Maker ทุกคนได้เก็บเกี่ยวประสบการณ์และแนวคิดไปปรับแก้ในงานของตนหรือไปต่อยอดได้อีกด้วย นอกจากผลงานสิ่งประดิษฐ์ที่ชาว Maker นำมาแสดงให้ดูแล้วภายในงานยังประกอบไปด้วยการ Workshop ต่างๆที่น่าสนใจอาทิเช่น Demo: CPLD & MKR Vidor 4000 , GoGo Bright (ซึ่งเป็นอุปกรณ์เพิ่มเติมสำหรับ Kid Bright) หรือ AirBoat เป็นต้น เพื่อเป็นการให้ผู้ร่วมงานได้เรียนรู้สิ่งใหม่ๆที่เกิดขึ้นและนำไปต่อยอดต่อไป นอกจากการ Workshop แล้วก้ยังมีการแข่งขันเพื่อให้เกิดความสนุกสนานเช่น Sumo Robot หรือ AirBoat เป็นต้น ในงานนี้พวกผมก็ได้นำสิ่งประดิษฐ์ไปแสดงในงานอีกด้วยโดยสิ่งประดิษฐ์ที่ยินดีนำเสนอเลยก็คือเครื่องแจกขนมหมีโคอาล่าตามค่า BMI ของคนที่มาเล่นแต่ละคนซึ่งในตอนแรกบอกได้คำเดียวว่าเละมากครับจากที่คิดว่าจะเป็นเครื่องแจกขนมแต่ดันกลายเป็นเครื่องบดขนมไปในพริบตา(ผิดคาดอย่างมากเลย555)เพราะด้วยมอเตอร์การเขียนโค้ดคำสั่งที่พึ่งได้เรียนรู้มาแบบสดๆร้อนๆก็ทำให้มีข้อผิดพลาดไปบ้างและด้วยขนมหมีโคอาล่าที่มีเหลี่ยมมีมุมก้ยิ่งทำให้เป็นข้อผิดพลาดที่มาพร้อมอุปสรรค์ของขนมที่อัดแน่นไม่ยอมลงมาในถาดของมอเตอร์ในตอนแรกวุ่นๆกันมากในสิ่งที่มันผิดพลาด ผมเพื่อนๆและพี่ๆก็ได้รุมช่วยกันแก้ไขกันจนไม่ได้ไปดูที่บูทอื่นๆเลย แต่ด้วยความที่อาจารย์แจวอยากให้พวกผมได้ไปดูหาประสบการณ์บ้างอาจารย์จึงได้ให้พวกผมคิดแก้ปัญหาเฉพาะหน้าไปก่อน พอเวลาผ่านไปก้แก้เรื่องการหมุนของมอเตอร์ได้ประกอบกับที่อาจารย์แจวได้ไปซื้อขนมที่มีรูปร่างกลมมาเปลี่ยนด้วยเพื่อให้การไหลของขนมลงในถาดสัมพันธ์กับการทำงานของมอเตอร์สุดท้ายในวันแรกก้ผ่านไปได้ด้วยดีครับ ในช่วงเย็นก็มีการจัดเลี้ยงอาหารแบบบุฟเฟ่ต์พร้อมเครื่องดื่มต่างๆนานาแล้วแต่จะเลือกบอกได้เลยครับอาหารอร่อยมากเครื่องดื่มก้รสชาติกลมกล่อมดี และเย็นวันนั้นนี่เป็นวันดีจริงๆครับมีเหตุการณ์ที่น่าประทับใจเกิดขึ้นกับอาจารย์แจวแบบจังๆเลยแต่ก็เป็นที่น่ายินดีสำหรับอาจารย์ไปแหละครับ งานในวันแรกก็จบไปด้วยดีครับ ต่อมาในวันที่สอง(วันสุดท้าย)ด้วยความที่ตอนกลางคือก็ได้ไปปรับแก้มอเตอร์มาให้เสถียรและเพิ่มปุ่มที่ปรับแก้ไขเมื่อมอเตอร์ไม่ตรงแล้ววันนี้นี่ชิวกันมากเลยครับเครื่องเราก็แค่เติมขนมแล้วทำงานได้เลย(ก็อาจมีสะดุดบ้างในบางทีที่ขนมไม่ค่อยลงก็แก้ไขกันไป)ที่บูทก็สลับกันมาอยู่มาเผื่อนำเสนอหรือบอกวิธีใช้งานเครื่องแจกขนมของเรา วันนี้ก้ได้เดินไปดูหลายๆสิ่งประดิษฐ์ที่น่าสนใจรวมถึงการแข่งขันต่างๆด้วยครับ(บอกได้คำเดียวว่าสนุกมากเลยทีเดียวครับ)เมื่อเวลาผ่านไปช่วงหนึ่งก็ถึงเวลาที่ต้องเดินทางกลับกันแล้ว(น่าเสียดายครับที่ไม่ได้ดูการแข่งขัน AirBoat ที่พี่ๆของเราได้แข่งขัน)แต่ยังไงผมก้ได้ประสบการณ์ต่างๆมากมายทั้งสนุกสนานรวมถึงแนวคิดที่นำไปต่อยอดได้เยอะแยะเลยครับ สุดท้ายนี้ผมก็ต้องขอบคุณอาจารย์แจว (อ.ธนาทิพย์ จันทร์คง)และอาจารย์กุ๊กไก่ มากๆครับที่พาผมและเพื่อนๆพี่ๆไปร่วมเปิดประสบการณ์ในงาน Chiang Mai Maker Party 2018 นี้ครับ -- -- UP-Creative and Maker Club Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech

Was 2018 the Tipping Point for Data-Driven Marketing?,Written by Sam Carter," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Sam Carter Follow -- Listen Share In many ways, 2018 has felt like a transition year for the marketing industry. We have witnessed first-hand a shift in attitudes as the sector has realised data science is becoming no longer a luxury but a necessity. Its application is unquestionably challenging marketing to be more data-driven than ever before. Here are some reflections on 2018 and predictions for this year: Measurement is still critical The size of the prize in data-driven attribution and measurement in 2019 is huge, for two standout reasons. Firstly, an opportunity: data can now be collected and analysed at a scale that enables a better understanding of the customer and their path to purchase than ever before. Secondly, the problem: the same driver of the opportunity in data is resulting in a rate of evolution in AdTech and MarTech with which most marketers can’t keep up. Each new technology, channel or tool adopted creates its own data silo and increases the gap to a holistic understanding of the customer. For these reasons, we believe measurement and attribution are the necessary enabler for data-driven decision making in every facet of marketing. Forrester’s Wave supports this, showing that marketers are increasingly calling for measurement tools that can help them deliver content that effectively targets individual customers. Fortunately, the expectation for what data-science and AI can deliver here are starting to be matched by the reality. Not only will a data-driven approach increase the ROI of emerging channels but it has also been proven to renew the effectiveness of traditional ones in 2018. The remarkable resurgence of billboard advertising has been driven to a large extent by the fact that the channel has ‘progressed to the point where advertisers can now track nearly all of the same metrics with a billboard as they can with a digital ad’. It’s a fascinating story of how data and measurement have resurrected a ‘relic of the past’ and opened up exciting opportunities for marketers. Nailing down data ethics The advent of the GDPR legislation within the European Economic Area (EEA), as well as the fallout from events such as Cambridge Analytica, have had profound effects. Notably, in May, Google pulled access rights to user-level data within the EEA, preventing marketers from collecting this information for cross-channel measurement and attribution of Display advertising. Google represents 44% of global advertising spend according to Forrester’s October Privacy report and analysts are expecting this new policy to extend globally by the end of 2019. Forrester’s assessment is astonishingly frank, making it impossible to “use independent attribution models for precise, granular-level measurement”. The data privacy changes have certainly resulted in another false start for 360 degree attribution but we have observed an overall positive mentality shift as a result. The new limitations in access to 3rd party data has forced marketers to look inwards, at their 1st party data and for most, there is a treasure trove of future IP and competitive advantage to unlock in the data their brands own. To do that, 2019 has to be the year where marketing starts to commit to breaking down the silos, with unified 1st party data now the foundation for not only better measurement and attribution but also GDPR compliance and data science more broadly. New perspectives on measurement The GDPR and data management challenges have also contributed to changing goals for marketers. Brand awareness has climbed to become the number one priority for marketers, overtaking customer lifetime value (CLTV). Whilst the potential impact on business of optimising CLTV is still highly regarded, it’s deprioritised because the data silo problem makes it extremely difficult to measure, let alone optimise. We frequently hear complaints about the lack of effective tools to quantify the impact of different marketing strategies on CLTV. Whilst we knew the industry still had progress to make here, we were taken aback by the lack of progress revealed by some recent survey results. This month, ClickZ research showed us that only 33% of marketers believe that their measurement tools are accurately delivering accurate attribution across all channels. An even fewer 9% have confidence that their company as a whole has an “excellent” understanding of multi-touch attribution across the lifecycle of a customer. We predict that in 2019, marketers will stop looking at metrics and KPIs in silos too. Whereas in the past, we’ve seen huge swings in sentiment (and spend) from brand marketing to direct response, marketers can now expect their measurement partners to help them understand and optimise the drivers of success at every level, from acquisition to CLTV and the role brand plays in driving both. Customer care will come first In 2018, customer acquisition costs (CAC) rose again, driving an increase of almost 50%over the past five years, according to Hubspot research. It is now costing on average five times more to acquire a new customer than it is to retain an existing customer. In this context, we hope to see a move away from the short-term strategies that deliver fast ROI at the expense of long term customer health. We predict that retaining and nurturing existing customers will become more of a business priority for all, backed by the opportunity in the data to get a more granular and complete understanding of the customer and the consequences of marketing activities on them. Certainly, with Amazon continuing its global domination in 2018, built on AI and its principle to ‘start with the customer and work backwards’, there is a good precedent here! More businesses empowered to build better business cases 39% of respondents ranked proving ROI as their biggest challenge for 2019. Interestingly, this was closely followed by 27% telling us they feared not getting enough capital for their budgets. Clearly, marketers are still not able to objectively prove the effectiveness of either specific channels or their broader strategy. We’ve written about the opportunity in marketing measurement and attribution that data science is opening up, from identifying channels underrepresented by out-of-the-box attribution models in Google Analytics to drilling into channels that are traditionally overvalued. It appears from the Hubspot survey that it’s also becoming a business imperative. CFOs and CEOs are expecting CMOs to be a revenue-driving function… and be able to communicate through the data how they are going to drive it. Integrating data specialism into your teams Data is fast becoming the basis for all competitive advantage in marketing and it’s critically important that we organise our teams in the same way. It is no longer sensible or even possible to segregate data specialists and traditional marketers. Companies must sponsor communication and continual learning between both groups. It is not necessary for marketers to have all these data skills but it is crucial to understand their importance and application. It is up to managers to ensure this collaboration takes off and thrives. In 2018 we reached the tipping point, where the application of data has become a prerequisite for marketing success. The future is certainly bright for those willing to embrace the emergent technologies and foster cultures that make data central. It is easier than ever to start and we believe that a ‘Start Small & Grow’ approach is fundamental to success, finding what works for you and building from there.

Succeeding as a Woman in Technology in Pakistan,Written by World Learning," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in World Learning Follow -- Listen Share Women across the globe often hesitate to study and pursue careers in technology. Durr-e-Nayab, a programming teacher at the University of Engineering & Technology in Peshawar, Pakistan, is an exception. She has always been curious. Her earliest memories are of tearing apart her toys. She imagined herself as an engineer who built programs and designed things. “I really looked up to my brother, who was an engineer,” she says. “Luckily, my parents encouraged me to follow my interests.” Nayab opted for a computer science postgraduate degree and began teaching at the Computer Systems Engineering department at UET Peshawar. She is also pursuing a PhD. Seeing her passion, the university management nominated her for a training offered by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) called the Skills for Youth Program (SYP). Through SYP, youth in the critical stabilization regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas learned Information and communications technology skills and were linked to employment opportunities. Nayab enrolled in Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) Routing & Switching and CCNA Security training. Thanks to the hands-on experience with networking, she is now able to explain concepts to her students in a more engaging way. “SYP was different because we were taught as future instructors,” she says. Aside from becoming a better teacher, Nayab also has the option to work in the field. “There is a difference between theoretical knowledge and practicality, and this training has helped me bridge that gap,” she says. Soft skills were also a focus of the SYP program. Nayab said the sessions on public speaking were particularly helpful, and today, with both subject knowledge and confidence, she often takes the lead in faculty meetings and is seen as a candidate for a senior leadership position. Nayab is the first woman in her family to pursue a technical education. She is an inspiration for her younger cousins and nieces. It’s clear that Nayab is not only breaking stereotypes, she’s bringing change to society around her.

Stealing Light,Written by JJ Ruescas," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in JJ Ruescas Follow Predict -- Listen Share Prometheus stole the fire from the Olympians Gods and taught humans how to use it. That rebel act enabled progress and civilization for thousands of years. But, there is a more powerful element in nature and we stole it from Zeus’ own hands. We stole the power of Light! Picture this: None of those feats would have been possible had we not dared to tame the untamable. It’s said that Benjamin Franklin discovered electricity but maybe it was, in fact, a gift from the gods to humankind to see what we could achieve with it. We have not yet fully domesticated light yet, as we did with fire.

Tools I Explored and Worked in 2018,"Written by Muthu,1. CDAP,2. Python Flask,3. Adobe XD,4. Google Cloud Platform,5. Wacom,6. Slack slash command,7. Slack bot,8. Screen command,9. Qlik Sense,10. Github API"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Muthu Follow Muthu -- Listen Share The year 2018 was the wonderful year for me. I explored lot of tools both in Machine learning and Programming aspects. The data integration, pipeline and workflow management system which helped me to create the automation system and reduced 80% of my manual work. Also used Python Flask as the web service to run my other colleagues code from CDAP HTTP sync process Flask is the powerful Python tool and helped me to build the REST API in 5minutes. Created the 2D graph tool using Flask as the backend service with Pandas data frames Of-course, the UI / UX is important to any Machine Learning applications to present the core functionality in a wonderful manner. XD helped me to build the UX in an hour. Previously, I’ve used CorelDraw & Photoshop to build the UI. First time created UX prototypes using XD. After explored the lot of tools in Amazon Web Service (AWS), for a project, I had a good chance to work with GCP. Created the secured network with three different kinds of applications on each machine and tied all those things with the firewall and the Virtual Private Network (VPN). Started using Wacom Intuos Pen-Tablet with MS-Powerpoint & MS-Word applications to make the meeting notes in my own style. Even though the application of Wacom pen tablet is for creating arts, I used this as the note making tool. Created my own Slack slash command for fetching and showing the github issues. So that, I could get the current status of the github issues of the specified repository. Created slack bot to show the notification of the automation workflow. Previously, for the automation system, I’ve created the LOG system to write the log in a file. After understanding the Slack bot, connected the automation system with slack bot to send the log as the notification to a specified channel. Initially struggled with managing multiple operations in the server. The screen command helped me to manage multiple operations in a single window Even though, I explored Qlik sense in 2017, I started implementing the Qlik sense cloud application for a realtime client project as the data analytics platform. Qlik helped me to explore the data using its own features like global filtering , bookmarks etc. I love Qlik because of its data management. Not like other data visualization tools, Qlik flatten the data for quick and easy access of the data globally. Using the Github API, controlled and monitored all the operations of the company’s github profile. I could remove or add a user to/from the repository without accessing the front-end of Github website. -- -- Muthu » 9+ years of experience in Data engineering, Dashboard designing » 3+ years of experience in Web application development Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*EF4WHxKMY15gWT5f78drtQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*N9ehprrZxzi9WEYDsKmLYg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*2izc6QAQbUxIANwbCFPJvA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*EF4WHxKMY15gWT5f78drtQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*N9ehprrZxzi9WEYDsKmLYg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*yuVzMhCJyDENbyhwAsrkwA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*EF4WHxKMY15gWT5f78drtQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5uNzLyTJP4WWF6a01zGy8Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*EF4WHxKMY15gWT5f78drtQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*-efyobL0q8EOd3I2diMGZg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*EF4WHxKMY15gWT5f78drtQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*fPBO3RpGyyBau2H_aTWOpg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*EF4WHxKMY15gWT5f78drtQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*r5coQ_IUZNe0yjOH7vq_6w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*-7F-xdEpfDbogXdyl141OQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*I2ObYjzqveyXzEe9QixMPw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*FCSZoy-APX517P8IPmI6pw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*TQlEMeYwwWc38Wqm7EfCTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*0-N4JrXpZG1KJfIrAutd3A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*J9stjQkRbmVzR4v4hzmg1g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*s3Dc57UpIOu2oowm.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*pN0q7fJWoIw59mXAz46x3Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*bOVFN2_iLTHM5m2c.jpeg']",3-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@muthupandian?source=post_page-----bdc6ff6a4021--------------------------------,4,2 min read
8 Social Media Marketing Predictions for 2019,Written by Rachael Bassey," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Rachael Bassey Follow DataDrivenInvestor -- Listen Share The changing dynamics of social media marketing trends annually are deep and profound. With 3.196 billion social media users globally, according to the Global Digital Report 2018 and an avalanche of new social media platforms being churned out daily, it is no surprise, the average person in the world spends 2 hours and 15 minutes every day on social media, that is, one out of every three minutes spent online. While the attention span of today’s users dropped to 8 seconds in 2018, it is crucial for brands to build their social media marketing plans/goals for the new year with this in mind. Without further ado, here are my social media marketing predictions for 2019: 1) Artificial Intelligence: It is estimated that the Compound Annual Growth Rate of AI’s adoption in the social media industry will be over 30% by 2023. AI solutions consists of technologies collaborating to find connections within enormous data sets (synonymously known as Big Data). As it pertains to social media marketing, current AI tools are highly valuable for content creation, strategic planning and reporting. Chat bots and virtual assistants have become increasingly ubiquitous, but this is only the beginning. In the future, chat bots will use “colloquial APIs” to respond to customers queries in a more human-like form. Currently, the automated service revolution has become prevalent in e-commerce sites and on messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger. Social media marketers who become bullish about AI and Machine learning tools in 2019 will certainly have a competitive advantage as the demand for personalized experiences will continue to grow amongst customers. 2) Geo-location videos: Undoubtedly, location plays a vital role in how videos are discovered by individuals. With interesting developments taking over the industry like the Live Location feature of Facebook Messenger, Director Mix of YouTube; the room for brands to deliver thousands of localized videos in one campaign using Google Maps data is exciting. Thus, with precise location and robust metadata, marketers will be able to deliver more relevant content in 2019. 3) Visuals are taking over: videos convey more in sight, sound and feeling(s) than words or pictures alone. Videos on social media have grown exponentially in recent years. Between 2016 and 2017, views of branded video content increased by 99% on YouTube and 258% on Facebook; A video tweet is 6x more likely to be retweeted than a photo Tweet. As such, two vital developments for 2019 stand out: ● Visual search: In the words of Pinterest’s CEO Ben Silbermann “the future of search will be about pictures rather than keywords.” Visual search technology is being integrated into branded apps and websites as well as an augmented visual search functionality being built into channels such as Pinterest, Bing, and Google. This will be carried on to 2019 with 27 percent of all searches across 10 major platforms being for images. The time effectiveness and convenience this technology offers makes it particularly exciting for ecommerce retailers. ● Vertical videos: For decades, ‘horizontal’ or landscape videos have been the norm. However, vertical videos are leading the way today as they’ve been adopted across all major channels particularly because they are better for mobile viewers. According to Facebook Business, 65% of consumers consider brands that advertise with vertical video ‘more innovative’ and 79% of ‘novice video consumers’ prefer the vertical format and consider it more engaging. We see more brands using this functionality in 2019 to appeal to the taste of their users. 4) Transparency and security: In 2018, the world witnessed the enforcement of GDPR in the European Union. Due to the high security risk of social media in regards to data leaks and misinformation, people have become extra cautious in a bid to protect their privacy, this sensitivity is not going to end with 2018 or anytime soon. To earn and maintain users trust, measures to protect their data and privacy must be put in place. Be open and sincere with users about data privacy and utilization and how they can discard their information permanently. 5) Live streaming: According to a survey by vimeo conducted with New York Magazine, it reports that 80% of respondents would rather watch live videos from a brand than read a blog, and 82% prefer live videos from a brand to social posts. This is expected to become more widely used in 2019 for social media marketing campaigns as online viewers are thrilled by the buzz, connection and urgency of live videos. Undeniably, they create active engagement due to their real time experience and authenticity. 6) Augmented Reality (AR): With Facebook partnering with over 700 brands to achieve the companies AR vision, we can only expect to see more of this technology in 2019. The partnership entails developing an upgraded advertising platform driven by AR technology. AR-based adverts on social media have better appeal and a wider reach due to its dynamic and versatile nature. It encourages interactive UX for brands and exponentially grows conversion rates across their social media channels. 7) Influencer marketing: Influencer marketing focused majorly in connecting brands and influencers at its early stage. However, a new report from Business Insider Intelligence estimates Influencer marketing reaching between $5 billion and $10 billion in 2022. Influencers tend to have higher user engagement than content generated by brands and this will grow even more with the buzz of videos and stories. However, in the new year, we expect to see brands go the Amazon route in managing influencers regardless of the pay before service rule. 8) Gamification: Integrating the “fascinating and irresistible” characteristics of games into non-game contexts will be adopted vastly in 2019 to impact the virality of social media campaigns. This will make significant impact in the industry as it encourages conversations with users, brand loyalty and content engagement. We expect to see a further rise in gaming hybrid apps and customized marketing driven by gamification. In conclusion, 2019 will be about personalization, improved customer experience, automation and AI powered technology. It is important to stay ahead of the curve. -- -- DataDrivenInvestor I work with Slum kids and women at dawn, Travel and capture moments at noon, Feast on books and Lisa Nichols, Tony Robbins and V.

"Introducing Huddle: A Social Network for Private, Community Mindshare","Written by Huddle,The Start,The Problem,The Solution,The Future,Join Us"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Huddle Follow -- Listen Share We’re excited to introduce you to Huddle, a decentralized social network of privacy-focused groups built for community mindshare. Huddle was created to empower you with complete control over your digital activity and identity! My name’s Quintin, co-founder of Huddle. I love trying to understand people and designing amazing experiences for them. I’ve accrued an expansive skillset, but a developer I am not. I joined a Slack group named Maker’s Kitchen: a community where makers, builders and developers come together to create and support one another. I noticed a post from a talented developer named Bryce, introducing himself as excited to join the community and open to collaboration. I was reminded of this: You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take. — Michael Scott So, channeling my inner Steph Curry, I sent Bryce a DM. I didn’t have a particular idea in mind, but I wanted to get the conversation going. One thing led to another and here we are, a unique balance of skills and personality that make a co-founder relationship strong. To complete the recipe, sprinkle in a disdain for the structure and management of current social networks along with a passion for blockchain decentralization. We knew: it was time to change the online social experience. Social media is a valuable tool that keeps us globally connected. It’s what allowed us to meet even though we live in completely different states. That’s awesome! Although, social networks just weren’t cutting it for us. We saw huge problems that needed to be fixed with not just new code, but a freshly designed user experience. We were fed up with companies that: It was time for a change and we knew we could use Blockstack as a foundation to allow a more refined and private social experience. So we did. We created a decentralized social network focused on quality, not advertising revenue. Here’s what Huddle is all about: Here are some features we have planned for the future of Huddle: 1 — Event Management 2 — Facebook Group Transfer 3 — Micropayment System 4 — Mobile Application Launch 5 — Product Suite 6 — Enterprise Offering Have an idea that isn’t on this list? Please send it our way — we’d absolutely love to chat with you: contact@huddle.group We strongly believe in a decentralized future where the user is empowered, privacy is a priority and community mindshare thrives.

Also during the month of November, Iran also claimed that it has been a target of cyber attacks originated from Israel. According to Iranian officials the cyber attacks failed to leave any damage on Iranian ICT infrastructure as they were neutralised by Iranian forces. After months of anticipation, the Trump administration unveiled new sanctions against Iran, including economic sanctions on 50 banks and their subsidiaries, Iran’s national airline, and 200 individuals and vessels in the country’s shipping industry. Iran continued to develop its response to these new sanctions (and other perceived external threats) throughout November, in the face of continuing public anxiety about falling living standards and economic uncertainty. No meetings of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace (SCC) took place during the month of November. The SCC is required to meet every at least once every four weeks. The last meeting took place on 22 October. In the past, Rouhani has been criticised for not holding frequent enough meetings of the SCC, although so far in his second term meetings have been held on a regular basis. On 23 November representatives from a number of domestic messaging apps met with Deputy ICT Minister Hamid Fatahi. In the meeting, Fatahi said that a document titled “Supporting Domestic Messaging Apps” had been passed on 1 August 2016 by the SCC and received approval from Supreme Leader Khamenei before being sent to all the appropriate ministries and organisations. According to Fatahi, the documents outlined five or six action points for the ICT Ministry but the rest of the actions was for other organisations and ministries. Although the document is not available in full for the public, it appears to be leading document in outlining the financial and infrastructural support each section of Iranian government must give to domestic messaging apps. The meeting was also attended by representatives from the messaging apps Soroush, Eitaa, and BisPhone. The conservative MP Ehsan Ghazizadeh — who recently launched the parliamentary ‘Cyberspace Faction’ — was also present. On 11 November General Assembly of Telecommunication Infrastructure Company gathered and its members voted for the budget of the TIC for the coming year. During as well as Siroos Movaseghi, representatives from ICT Ministry, Plan and Budget organisation, Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance, Ministry of Defence and Armed Forces Logistic, and Ministry of Cooperatives, Labour, and Social Welfare. On 5 November at the ITU’s 2018 Plenipotentiary Conference in Dubai, Iran was elected to the ITU Council. It occupies one of the 13 seats in the ITU’s ‘Asia and Australasia’ region. The Council has a total of 48 seats globally. This marks an extension of Iran’s engagements in ICT diplomacy and international internet governance sphere, and will allow it to play a more influential role in global debates over global ICT regulations. According to the ITU website, the Council “acts as the Union’s governing body in the interval between Plenipotentiary Conferences. Its role is to consider broad telecommunication policy issues to ensure that the Union’s activities, policies and strategies fully respond to today’s dynamic, rapidly changing telecommunications environment”. On 19 November, the head of Iran’s Communications Regulatory Authority (CRA) Hossein Fallah Joshaghani stated that IRIB was an obstacle to the development of Iran’s mobile networks. He accused IRIB of refusing to free up the 700 and 800 MHz frequencies, therefore denying their use to mobile phone operators. He added that the issue has been referred to the SCC to resolve the conflict between IRIB and the ICT Ministry. Previously, IRIB and the ICT Ministry have found themselves in direct conflict over a number of other issues, such as the regulation of IPTVs. On 6 November during Iran’s ‘Passive Defence Week’, Iran’s ICT Minister Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi unveiled Iran’s “National Trunk Radio” network. The network was tested by connecting Mazandaran, Kerman and Khuzestan with locations in Greater Teheran. The Network was built after by a 17 billion IRR investment allocated to it by the cabinet and Supreme Council of National Security. According to the ICT Ministry this infrastructure will be used to manage ICT communications during times of national crisis. On 5 November Iran’s ICT Minister Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi announced that Iran’s network infrastructure was the target of a cyber attack from an Israel-based company called Golden Line. Jahromi claimed that the attack was successfully neutralised by Iranian officials. He added that Iran will pursue the matter legally in International institutions. Jahromi did not specify the details of the attack, although he added that Iran’s mobile phone network infrastructure was the main target of the attack On 25 November Colonel Mohammadreza Amooyi from the Kermanshah Province Police said that the Cyber Police (FATA) has been monitoring social media for rumours and false news in the aftermath of the earthquake in the provence, and will take legal actions against those spreading rumours to disturb the peace. The 6.3-magnitude earthquake took place on Sunday 24 November. In recent years, FATA has been active in warning Iranian social media users about the dangers of spreading disinformation, threatening violators with arrest and legal action. On 26 November Iran’s ICT Ministry announced that bank cards are now synced with the subsidised fuel cards of Iranians. According to the ICT Ministry, this development will lead to citizens saving 3.3tn IRR (78.5m USD) per year. The development of digital services is a key pillar of the development of SHOMA, and has been heavily promoted by government ministries. On 14 November Niloufar Morad, the Strategic Planning and Coordination Deputy from the ICT Ministry’s Office of Economic Investigations said that between March 2012 — March 2013 (or 1391 in the Iranian calendar) the ICT sector added a total of 1.41% to the Iranian economy, whereas between March 2016 — March 2017 (or 1395) this figure rose to 1.52%. According to Morad, by 1395 the ICT sector was worth 44tn IRR (10.45bn USD) to the Iranian economy. On 6 November Mohammad Sadegh Beikpour, the Head of the ICT Ministry’s Passive Defence Committee said that the committee is working to ensure that Iran’s online banking services are provided on SHOMA’s infrastructure and accessible at any situation. This appears to be a move to boost the readiness of Iran’s financial systems for crises and incidences of internet shutdowns, either caused by state authorities or external actors. Seyyed Jamal Hadiyan Tabayi the head of public relations at ICT Ministry on 9 November dismissed the claims that there are plans for “smart filtering” of Instagram. He added that ICT Ministry would be completely open with the public on these issues. Last month an official from FATA claimed there are such proposals are being considered. ”Smart Filtering” refers to a previous flagship ICT policy which sought to block access to certain Instagram pages while providing access to the rest of the site to Iranian users. The policy was previously abandoned after Instagram’s introduction of the HTTPS protocol made Iran’s filtering methods obsolete. On 7 November Saeed Mehdiyoon the Deputy for Regulation Coordination at the National Cyberspace Center said that the issues of support for domestic messaging apps and the granting further control to armed forces outlined in ‘Managing Social Messengers Bill’ must be introduced in different bills. Both policy initiatives appeared in the existing draft of the bill. It is likely that if the bill progresses to a binding vote in Parliament, ICT policy making bodies such as the National Center for Cyberspace will seek to contest it further. The current version of the bill contradicts the stated policies of the ICT Ministry and the SCC, and appears to constitute a rather ambitious push by conservative elements in the Iranian establishment to secure more influence over national ICT infrastructure and policy-making processes.

Shoe Dog by Phil Knight,Written by Anuda Weerasinghe"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Anuda Weerasinghe Follow -- Listen Share Back when I was in elementary school, I used to read a lot. I mostly read fiction, but nevertheless I would read often. However, with the greater penetration of technology and social media into my life, my reading hobby died down to a point where it was merely a chore I did for school. Although I wasn’t reading, I still developed my passion for science and technology and improved my knowledge in these areas through sources like YouTube videos, blog posts and articles. But during the summer of 2018, I realized something: compared to YouTube videos, blog posts and articles, the quality and quantity of the content in books are at a different level. A YouTuber at most will spend a few days working on scripting, shooting and editing a video. Similarly a short blog post or article won’t take more than a few days of work. But a book takes years of planning, writing, and editing to get published. Also, whilst anyone with an internet connection can upload a YouTube video or write a blog post, a book goes through a huge amount of quality control before it’s published. After understanding the relative value of books as a medium to grow my knowledge and understanding of technology, I decided to start reading regularly again and set myself the goal of reading a book each week or 25 books before the end of 2018. By today, the 1st of January 2019, I’ve read 23/25 books, which I’m pretty happy with. Over the course of these 6 months and 23 books, I learnt a huge amount and I also feel that I have grown more as a person. Of course not all 23 books taught me a lot and had a great impact on me, but the following 15 books did. I have ordered them from least to most impactful and shared a bit of information about each book and the lessons I learnt from each of them. I picked up this book purely because I was familiar with Sinek and his idea of Starting with Why and its effect on an audience. I first watched Simon Sinek’s Ted Talk, Start with Why, around the beginning of middle school, and it has shaped the structure of my writing, speaking and thinking processes. “Start with Why” builds on the idea of the golden circle that’s brought up in the Ted Talk. However, in addition to focusing on the power of “Starting with Why” as a communication tool, Sinek illustrated a variety of examples to emphasize the importance of having a why and shaping one’s day to day activities around this why. He explains that be it an organization or an individual, progress requires a clear understanding of why they get out of bed every morning. Although I’m not a big fan of soccer, I picked up this book because I am a fan of Mathematics and Data Science. In Soccermatics, David Sumpter uses a lot of match data coupled with mathematical reasoning and analysis techniques to explore the math behind various aspects of football: from formations to bicycle kicks. He also uses match data and a bit of Machine Learning to predict future match results, which he then put to the test by betting on them. Though Sumpter’s explanations were a bit boring at times, some results were quite interesting and I found it really interesting how Math can be applied to almost anything- even football. My interest in the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence has been steadily growing in the last year or so. Life 3.0, is about our future in the age of Artificial Intelligence. Tegmark explains that life on Earth has gone through three main stages — Life 1.0 represents the simple one-celled organisms like bacteria that can only survive and replicate itself, but cannot redesign its software (skills and knowledge) or hardware (physical composition); Life 2.0 represents animals like humans who can survive and replicate and also redesign and update its software (skills and knowledge) through practice and data analysis, but cannot update its hardware (physical composition); finally Life 3.0 represents the future of life, sentient computer systems or robots, that can replicate itself, redesign its software (skills and knowledge) and redesign its hardware (physical composition.) I think this a very novel way of looking at the idea of AI and it hit me quite hard. Throughout the book, Tegmark explores both the potential social, economic and political challenges and opportunities when life reaches its 3rd stage of Life 3.0. This is a great read if you’re at all interested in AI. Steve Jobs, Co-Founder and Former CEO of Apple Inc, has been one of the most influential personalities in the modern world. Walter Isaacson’s biography of Jobs, tells the whole story of the mega icon including his ups, downs and quirks. Reading this book, gave me a better understanding of the history of the world’s first trillion dollar organization and its successes. The book also taught me a lot about leadership through the recounts of Jobs’ unconventional leadership and management strategies. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in technology, leadership or business. Outnumbered is another book by David Sumpter that revolves around the subject of Mathematics. But this time, Sumpter focuses on more of the controversial applications of Mathematics including the algorithms that feed us information on a day to day basis. Sumpter uses data coupled with his knowledge of data science to explain and evaluate the effects of various algorithms on recent political events. He explores some of the issues we’ve seen as controversial in the last few years including fake news, and Cambridge Analytica’s impact on democratic processes. I found outnumbered much more interesting than Soccermatics, perhaps because the context was more interesting to me. Nevertheless, I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in politics, technology, data science or math. At the time of writing, Jeff Bezos is the world’s richest man with a net worth of over $150 Billion. The Everything Store tells the story of the Princeton Graduate who saw the potential of the internet in the 1990’s and leveraged it to become the richest man in the world. Today, amazon has literally become “The Everything Store” and is a common household name. Stone recounts how Amazon started off as an online bookstore rather than the everything store it is today. Some of the most interesting and surprising aspects of the Amazon story to me, was the shear force that Amazon operates with in the market to get its way and come out on top. This is a great book for aspiring entrepreneurs and anyone interested in technology or business. There are four organizations that play a major role in our lives : Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. These are the four most influential companies on the planet, and Scott Galloway explores the hidden DNA of these companies in this book. He explores the rise of the four and also the key characteristics that make these organizations so powerful and successful. In addition to the exploration of the four’s technology, Galloway also highlights the key operation/management techniques and HR practices exercised by the four. I’ve been following and studying these companies for quite a bit, but this book took my understanding of these organizations to a greater depth. Google is a company that greatly inspired my journey as a technology enthusiast and programmer. In this book Vise and Malseed, recount the story of how two nerdy Stanford Grad students changed the way we organize the world’s information. The book explains what makes Google such a unique organization including the culture and management strategies employed at Google. Reading this book, further inspired my entrepreneurial and innovative spirit. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in technology or business. Mobile Telecommunications and the power that connectivity brings to users has probably been one of the most important developments in the last few decades. Especially in the developing regions of South Asia, the mobile telecommunications industry has had a massive impact on every single individual. In his book Now I’m Talking, Vijendran Watson tells his story as a pioneer in the mobile telecommunications industry. His well composed story from a young boy to a network engineer to finally the leader of many leading telecom operators has numerous lessons for everyone. Despite his eccentricities, Elon Musk is one of the most successful and important entrepreneurs and technologists in the world. Like Google, Musk’s work, from Tesla, to the Boring Company, has intrigued me for quite a while. I’ve watched multiple interviews and speeches by Musk, to get a better understanding of his thinking processes and management style, but no interview went to as much depth as this book by Ashlee Vance. The book tells the story of a young boy, who transforms from a victim of bullying in South Africa to one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the world. Vance highlights the challenges that Musk faced throughout his entrepreneurial journey from PayPal to Tesla to SpaceX, as well as the management strategies and work ethic that Musk demonstrates on a daily basis. This book gave me a new found respect for Elon Musk and also made me rethink my own work, people and time management skills. In his book Rich Dad Poor Dad, Kiyosaki highlights the difference between his two dads: his poor yet educated actual dad, and his rich investor/mentor dad. I didn’t know much about personal financial planning before I read this book, yet Robert Kiyosaki does an excellent job at simplifying the daunting task of financial planning into a few key guidelines. These guidelines are presented clearly and concisely making it easy to understand. I will probably reread this book in a few years, when I begin making my own financial decisions. Meanwhile, I think everyone should read this because the lessons are valuable to everyone. Freakonomics is a book that investigates some novel ideas by looking through data through concepts studied in Economics. As an economics student, I found this book really interesting especially because Dubner and Levitt do a great job in their explanations and analyses. The questions that were explored in the book include, Why do Drug Dealers Live with their Moms? and What do School Teachers and Sumo Wrestlers Have in Common? Although I found the conclusions and answers to these questions enjoyable and interesting, the book made the biggest impact on my critical thinking processes. Using economics concepts to analyze unconventional situations, Freakonomics demonstrated and introduced me to an entirely new way of thinking and solving problems. Do you think the world is getting worse? Most people seem to think that the world is getting worse in terms of economic, and social development. Often, we categorize the world into the “developed world” and the “developing world” and assume that things are naturally worse in the developing world and alright in the developed world. I was one of these people too until I read Hans Rosling. Rosline uses data to disprove the conventional wisdom and show that the world is improving in almost every measurable way. He then provides a variety of tools that will help you look at the world in a more insightful and progressive way rather than the “rich world” and the “poor world.” I think everyone should read this book because it’s important to accurately understand the status quo before we can make a change and move forward. American Kingpin was easily one of the most enjoyable books I read in 2018. The book outlines the story of the rise and fall of Ross Ulbtricht, the twenty-six year old programmer who built a billion-dollar online drug empire called the Silk Road from his bedroom. Bilton recounts the story excellently and captures the emotions of each and every moment of Ulbtricht’s life. Many of the books I read this year told the story of successful people and organizations. American Kingpin on the other hand is the story of a very talented person who went down the wrong path in his lifetime. Although reading about successes taught me a lot about how to be successful, I think reading about Ulbtricht had a greater impact on me because it highlighted the mistakes to avoid. Nike is such a big company that everyone all over the world knows the company and its products very well. However, few people know about the origins and growth of Nike as a business. I didn’t know much about Nike or even admired the company until I read Shoe Dog. Phil Knight is the founder and current chairman of Nike, and Shoe Dog is the retelling of the riveting story behind Nike from a reseller of imported Japanese shoes to a global mega icon. The book is excellently written and includes so many lessons about being an entrepreneur and the challenges and hardships that come with it. I read this book twice in a few days and I highly recommend it to everyone. Reading a book each week has been a great learning experience, and I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone. It is definitely not impossible, but if you’re struggling to find the time to keep up try starting slow by reading a book every two weeks or every month — you will still read more than you would have otherwise. I am going to keep reading and my goal for 2019 is to read 50 great books, so look forward to more posts like this.

Why new technology creates a threat as well as a potential competitive advantage,"Progress is not without sacrifice.,How to prevent ending up as a victim of a disruptive change.,3 lessons you need to take away from this article.,Written by Ritchie Terrence"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Ritchie Terrence Follow story-of-ams -- Listen Share New technology is arriving quicker than ever before. In removing friction to build better products we basically made the case for deploying technology to serve better those who you seek to serve. Offering better digital experiences to ultimately improve the bottom line. “Technology goes beyond mere tool making; it is a process of creating ever more powerful technology using the tools from the previous round of innovation.” –Ray Kurzweil Embracing the tech of tomorrow is the way forward. It has the ability to enable a life without friction. And that is how we should look at technology. As an enabler. As a means, not an end. Human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable… Every step toward the goal of justice requires sacrifice, suffering, and struggle; the tireless exertions and passionate concern of dedicated individuals. Martin Luther King, Jr. Of course, he was referring to the progress of mankind concerning racial equality but something very applicable to technology can be derived from this quote. Predicting what is going to be the next big thing is no exact science and therefore impossible. But one thing is. By doing nothing you will definitely risk losing out. If you’re not moving forward, you’re falling back. Wait long enough and you become obsolete. Irrelevant. Search engines changed how we approach writing, marketing, and understanding intent. Mobile devices changed the way we design interfaces, interactions, and experiences. Voice technology stands to make a similar impact and those who neglect to ride this wave risk losing out just like those who fell behind on search or missed the mobile wave. Read more on the idea of voice being the next wave here. Industries will be disrupted by players who are changing the game using technology. Some will ride the wave and some will get swallowed by it. That is the way it has always been and how it will be for the foreseeable future. But new technology also has a tendency to wipe the slate clean. It is hard to beat Hubspot in their SEO game with blogs. It is hard to steal away market share of a multinational supermarket chain who has brick and mortar stores everywhere. That is when you play their game without any innovating. To elaborate on this point, let’s go through one of the most well-known case studies ever. A generation ago, a “Kodak moment” meant something that was worth saving and savoring. Today, the term increasingly serves as a corporate bogeyman that warns executives of the need to stand up and respond when disruptive developments come to their market. Given that Kodak’s core business was selling film, it is not hard to see why the last few decades proved challenging. Cameras went digital and then disappeared into cellphones. People went from printing pictures to sharing them online. Sure, people print nostalgic books and holiday cards, but that volume pales in comparison to Kodak’s heyday. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2012, exited legacy businesses and sold off its patents before re-emerging as a sharply smaller company in 2013. Once one of the most powerful companies in the world, today the company has a market capitalization of less than $1 billion. While the common belief is that the sole reason lies in myopia meaning that Kodak had a narrow-minded marketing approach and focused on only one aspect out of many possible marketing attributes. In the process ignoring the actual demand of the customer. Basically, we’re saying that Kodak completely ignored digital photography but is that realistic given they were the market leader by miles and had an army of people with 100k+ salaries whos sole job it was to think about marketing, strategy, and product? Basically, we’re saying that Kodak completely ignored digital photography. It’s a bit more complicated than that. The first prototype of the digital camera was created in 1975 by Steve Sasson, an engineer for Kodak. So they had the technology but fail to recognize its potential. Not really. Kodak invested billions to develop a range of digital cameras. Ultimately embracing simplicity and carving out a strong market position with technologies that made it easy to move pictures from cameras to computers. So did they miss the real disruption when phones became good enough to take pictures with, and people shifted from printing pictures to posting them on social media and mobile phone apps. This is where it gets interesting… Before Facebook even was a thing, Kodak acquired Ofoto in 2001 which you could use to get Kodak prints of digital pictures. Imagine if Kodak had truly embraced its historical tagline of “share memories, share life.” Perhaps it could have rebranded Ofoto as Kodak Moments (instead of EasyShare Gallery), making it the pioneer in social media where people could share pictures, personal updates, and links to news and information. In real life, unfortunately, Kodak used Ofoto to try to get more people to print digital images. It sold the site to Shutterfly as part of its bankruptcy plan for less than $25 million in April 2012. That same month Facebook paid $1 billion to acquire Instagram, the 13-employee company Kevin Systrom had co-founded 18 months earlier. Spotting something and doing something are two very different things. Doing something and doing the right thing are also two very different things. But Kodak did not make these mistakes. They had the talent, the money, and even the foresight to make the transition. Like Kodad, companies often see the disruptive forces affecting their industry They frequently divert sufficient resources to participate in emerging markets. Their failure is usually an inability to truly embrace the new business models the disruptive change opens up. Kodak created a digital camera, invested in the technology, and even understood that photos would be shared online. Where they failed was in realizing that online photo sharing was the new business, not just a way to expand the printing business. As Ryan Holiday says: The Ego is the Enemy. -- -- story-of-ams Here you’ll find the result of what I read and think about. Mostly career and life essays.

How existing e-hailling players such as Uber could target middle-class demographics that use taxis in South Africa,Written by Emmanuel Sibanda," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Emmanuel Sibanda Follow -- Listen Share One of the tech-companies I find very interesting is Uber. The challenges they seem to encounter in different markets makes it a very interesting company to watch and the unique solutions they often come up to better adapt to local conditions, at-least in my eyes, show why they are a market leader in the transportation industry. At this stage I believe their strategy has evolved to trying to become a marketplace for transportation that gets you from point A to point B regardless of the mode of transportation. So be it through an electric scooter or a bus, the vision is that Uber would be the go to platform to get such transportation. What I find quite intriguing and inline with the aforementioned strategy is the recent launch of Uber Bus in Egypt and how a similar initiative would be aptly suited for the Southern African market. As someone who has studied, worked and lived in South Africa I understand that the impact of such a launch on the South African market would be significant to say the least. Close to 70% of all private transportation of individuals is through the minibus taxi industry. These minibus taxis are largely informal, have a designated route and pick up people from anywhere between the point where the route begins and where it ends. Customers pay in cash and taxis often drive recklessly and take detours to compete for clients, making it difficult for passengers to predict arrival times. People use this as a mode of transportation for everyday travel for both leisure and getting to and from work. According to the South African National Taxi Council, taxis transport about 15 million commuters daily, if we assume the average fare is R15 (thumb-suck) then we can put the size of the industry at around R82 billion. Assuming a smartphone penetration of 35% (Pew Research puts it at 51%, but the numbers could be skewed by smartphone users who have more than one smartphone) this would put the total addressable market for ride hailing in the taxi industry at around R28.4 billion (5.2 million commuters a day), presenting an obviously an amazing opportunity for Uber or any other player with the gall and capital to invest in an Uber Taxi type alternative. Understandably one of the biggest concerns with trying to step into the taxi industry’s turf is the likely backlash from the taxi industry. Historically, the launching of transportation options that potentially disrupt the taxi industry has created a lot of friction that has manifested in the form of violence. In many cases this has been averted through partnerships with the Taxi industry. Projects such as the MyCiti (bus rapid transit service in Cape Town) and the Gautrain averted these issues by through dialogue with taxi associations. For example, the launch of MyCiti in Cape Town involved Transport for Cape Town (TCT) buying out operating permits for taxi drivers operating in the City Bowl area with drivers receiving significant payouts as a result of this, limited permit buyouts in townships. This model drastically reduced potential conflict. Similarly, Uber/Taxify could approach the matter by looking to form a partnership with a select few Taxi companies that operate routes and has taxis that are in excellent condition in areas that are suburban areas or areas close to the metropolitan that are more heavily populated with working age middle-class demographics (according to FNB’s retail segment data this includes anyone earning a gross salary of between R7000 — R60000 per month) that are heavily populated with the objective of targeting the market segment that lies in the middle-class, uses taxis to get to work and have access to both a smartphone and a bank account. I would assume that this is the demographic that would most likely already know the brand, have a high smartphone penetration and a higher employment rate (they need to get to work on a daily basis). For this pilot program; i.) These taxis would operate only during peak hours; when people are going to work and when people are coming back from work to test market demand for this solution during the times people are most likely to need transportation and to understand whether this has the potential to actually grow the taxi market- so will this attract users who would in normal circumstances not take a taxi ii.) Using Cape Town as an example, it would only operate in residential areas such as Sea Point, Green Point, Mouille Point and take them to work either in the CBD or Century City with a few ‘partner taxis’ that are already designated to operate in those particular routes. This would presumably minimise the risk of backlash from the taxi industry and help build a case study to show how a partnership with an on-demand platform such as Uber could actually help Taxis increase their revenue. iii.) The taxis would travel during select pre-determined times for example 7:00, 7:30 and 8:00 in the morning and 16:00, 17:00 and 18:00 iv.) Users would be able to pre-book their seats for each ride and pay for the ride through the Uber App. Cash would not be an option. The taxi would then pick the user up from their location with the intention of taking them to their respective locations. The idea behind this would be to show partner taxis the convenience of an Uber partnership- eliminating the inconvenience of keeping change and cash v.) The taxis would pick up users from the locations they pre-book the seats from vi.) If the project is sufficiently capitalised the cost for travellers could initially be subsidised to aggressively drive demand. The added benefits and convenience of this services (getting picked up from your location and getting dropped off where you work) would warrant a higher fare than a typical taxi. The rate of the fare could be dependent on; i.) initial waiting time -the longer you make the taxi wait for you the more you delay other people so there is a strong need to add an incentive to ensure that passengers do not take too long to board the taxi ii.) the distance you want to travel For the customer this could; lower transportation costs and make regular Uber travel an option for a new set of customers who cannot necessarily afford a private Uber car on a daily basis, reduce uncertainty over arrival times because the taxi would have a pre-set schedule to pick up x amount of people and it would be possible to make arrival time predictions with some degree of accuracy (factoring in waiting times), this would in turn presumably reduce reckless driving from the driver which is normally caused by the driver trying to race for more customers and maximise her earnings per trip. For the taxi driver the advantages would be increased profitability per trip and more revenue certainty per trip. At-least during the pilot phase, the same taxis could then proceed to operate as normal after serving their Uber clients, limiting the risk of any loss of revenue on their part. The objective of this pilot would be to; i.) Build a case-study to show how an Uber partnership would help taxis increase their profitability per trip, showing how desirable such a partnership would be to companies that own taxis or taxi associations (according to Qualcomm there are about 330 taxi associations using over 360k minibuses). This case study would be used to persuade more taxis to partner with Uber with the intention of scaling into other areas populated with working age middle-class demographics. ii.) Show that Uber would not cannibalise the existing taxi market. To decrease potential friction between the taxis industry and Uber. If the Uber Taxi charges a premium on its services and requires a smartphone and a bank account in order to pre-book a seat. This would limit the target audience to people who have access to such things. While the profitability of a route could be important, I believe this pilot would be geared towards not just tapping into existing taxi customers who have the means to pre-book a seat, it has the ability to introduce new set of customers to the market- customers who would under normal circumstances, not have taken a taxi to go to work. Interestingly a somewhat similar partnership has been tested by AftaRobot with the Johannesburg Southern Suburbs Taxi Association, which allows users to ‘make a pickup request, and know when and where they’ll get a ride, making it easier for drivers to know where to pick up passengers, making their routes more clear and reducing the need to drive frantically to compete for passengers. The other pertinent question might be around operating permits, minibuses can only operate within designated routes. To address this issue, passengers could potentially be dropped off at a designated drop off point. -- -- Entrepreneurship | Data Science Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*BuF0FIW2pncTz-XEkHn3-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*WJMIdCHB9vX0oGqBPyjOFA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*BuF0FIW2pncTz-XEkHn3-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*NAj8H6p7Y2H7lyPvbg2U3w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*BuF0FIW2pncTz-XEkHn3-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*Kq1n6Yv-YUxJAL6P45PMcQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*7Pi56HuKXfLi_rgcbdT2zw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*1Z177dpTeAp7uEFc5Zx2xg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*C24zF7Hw7sylvMB3bD4Atg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*PZwAjN0r5uamtdHXRKXBIg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*BuF0FIW2pncTz-XEkHn3-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*iQJjezE8PMsrLMJyhgmWDA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*SSldMA8f2cLiwAZDfFFwVA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*v81PL_0CTnry3iWQHBAKpQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*cBIFfjjqzx8pzaemnAM0rQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*EhiV5eo34TIkvI6u-JFYmg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*pN0q7fJWoIw59mXAz46x3Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*bOVFN2_iLTHM5m2c.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg']",3-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@emmanuelsibanda?source=post_page-----c1872b2b239a--------------------------------,0,6 min read
Apple Has More Than My Money,Written by Ben Szabo," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Ben Szabo Follow -- 1 Listen Share It’s funny that our most material things control the most important aspects of our lives. Cracked phone screen? Worst thing ever. Hard drive corrupted? Day ruined. We rely more heavily on our technology each and every day. My devices are a part of me and have attached themselves at my hip for more reasons than one. Full disclosure, I’ve had Apple devices for the last 7 years, and I just recently purchased a new iPhone. When Apple released the first iPhone nearly 12 years ago, they kickstarted a new platform and method of keeping their customer base from switching to any other device, convenience. We constantly look for convenience in everyday life, which trains to take to work, ordering food ahead, or basically anyone who has an Amazon Prime account. Apple has captured that idea in every product they’ve released in the last decade preventing users from going to their competitors. Timeout, let’s be clear, there is actually nothing preventing one Apple customer from a switch to say, a Samsung device or the new Google Pixel 3. For the most part, there are extremely capable and much more affordable devices out there without a fruit logo that will do just fine. But Apple does it’s best to bring you in as a user once and knows that it likely won’t have to do much to keep you there. Unbox Therapy mentioned this recently while discussing the limitations Apple has created for itself in Asian markets with no “budget” smartphone options. Apple customers are stuck on that early innovation that Apple found in the early 2000s. They are still riding on that iTunes, iPod, original iPhone wave that has led us to devices like the iPhone XS and the iPad Pro. There is a familiarity and convenience to those features and devices that we still appreciate today. The simple Apple icons, the familiar glass back and aluminum band devices, and above all, iOS has become so nostalgic, that it can feel foreign to switch to another device. Apple has roped in many of us, including myself, and they do this meticulously and intentionally. For example, most Apple products, only work with Apple products. Your Apple Watch can only sync up to an iPhone, and Apple Music will only work within the Apple Music app. The Apple Homepod only works with another Apple device in your home, exclusively uses Siri, and might be the dumbest smart speaker out there. Apple AirPods, while brilliant, only work with mobile Apple devices. The exclusivity mixed in with intentionally limiting software encourages users to never let go of that shiny white logo. Once you go Apple, there is very little incentive to go back to anything else. Apple has created an ecosystem around their products, and this explains the phenomenon surrounding Apple user experience. In lamens terms, this means that Apple products almost force the user into using other Apple products, the hardware, software and key features of the devices require other Apple products to take full advantage of. This creates a sort of bubble that the user can’t escape from but can only make larger by purchasing more Apple products. It’s a trap, that limits a user’s experience. It basically allows all the features of a competitive smartphone, smart-device, smart speaker, or watch, without being able to use any of the other competitors. This is one of the largest drivers of smartphone choice right up there with battery life and price point. Any user can justify any flaw in a device if it lines up with their already existing cloud and keychain (see what I did there) of information. I would go as far to say, the number one reason an iPhone user continues to buy another iPhone or any other Apple product is that of the convenience of the Apple ecosystem. I know that is why I’ve continued this trend. Its convenience is most often countered by its limitations of that convenience. I don’t have some scathing review of this idea either. I mean, I’m stuck in the Apple ecosystem, I am aware of my entrapment, and I don’t feel the need to complain about it. It is genius. Apple has given me no reason to switch, I’m already hooked. They’ve got me, and they’ve probably got you too. With that being said, fewer people are upgrading to the newest flagship devices. Apple reportedly stopped sharing sales figures because the rate at which people are upgrading their devices has steeply declined. It took me nearly three years to upgrade from the iPhone 7 to the iPhone XR and about six years to upgrade my MacBook Pro. Users seem to be fine sticking with their two-year-old device as long as it saves all their passwords, apps, information, contacts, and so on. They find little need to upgrade their device to the latest model let alone switch to a completely different manufacturer. While shopping for new devices I absolutely looked at the Google Pixel, OnePlus 6T, and the new Microsoft Surface book. But the thought of migrating all my files, passwords and emails to a new OS was truly so off-putting that I just had to go back to Apple. The limitations of Apple devices are as egregiously apparent as they are intentional. Our devotion to our devices and our ecosystems is matched only by the convenience and openness of those platforms. As companies like Google begin to grow their ecosystems with Google Home and the success of the Google Pixel, we may see more competition within smartphone user dedication.

Acoustic Pulse Recognition Touchscreen"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Tarık Follow -- 1 Listen Share Did you know that there is 7 types of touchscreens? A touchscreen has the ability to detect a touch within the given display area. It is made up of 3 basic elements, a sensor, a controller and a software driver. All the variants of touchscreen technology carry their own distinctive characteristics, with individual benefits and limitations. If you push your finger on the screen and it collapses slightly, then it means it’s resistive. And you’re in big trouble. There are two plates under the screen that are not too close but not too far to each other and a continuous electric current passes through them. When you press your finger on the screen above, the two plates touch each other(not in an NSFW way) and the electric current at that point changes. And after that, the software does its job. These types of phones don’t care what type of pressure you apply, they work on their own. If you don’t believe me, go ahead, buy one. These phones don’t care about you so much that they have the possibility of sending love letters to your crush on their own. Stay a mile away from these. Commonly used for industrial purposes, capacitive phones don’t work with pressure, they work with anything that transmits electric currents or receives. In these types of phones, there is something like a grill that’s either made of copper or indium tin oxide. When we touch the screen, the current between the stylus and the grill is made. The rest is up to the software. It’s best to stay away from these too unless you love touching your phone with a big pencil instead of your thumb. SAW touch screen technology is based upon two transducers and a reflector placed on the glass surface. The waves are scattered across the screen by bouncing off the reflector form and received by the transducers. The touch is detected when the waves are absorbed. In comparison with the other touch screens; SAW provides superior clarity, resolution, and durability, with the ability to interact with a stylus or gloves. Unlike the other types, infrared touchscreen technology does not incorporate an overlay. Instead, a frame surrounding the display consists of LEDs on one side and phototransistor detectors on the other. The phototransistors detect an absence of light and relay a signal that determines the coordinates. The touch is identified and located at the point of interruption of the LED beams. Commonly used in outdoor locations, infrared touch screens are durable and can detect any input. Using optical sensors to recognize the touch, this touchscreen technology is popular for its versatility and scalability. Optical imaging relies on infrared lights. Two infrared imaging sensors are positioned at the top, which doubles up as emitters and retroreflective tapes at the three sides. The emitted lights are reflected back to the imaging sensors, which become blocked at the point of touch and create a shadow to locate the touch. Because optical touchscreens don’t use electrical currents, they can be activated using any object. A finger, gloved finger, stylus are all great input devices for an optical touchscreen. Your breath is also good because this phone can detect it. An APR touch screen is made up a glass overlay and four transducers attached to the back exterior. When the screen is touched, the friction creates acoustic waves. The transducers detect the acoustic wave, which is then converted into a signal. APR touch screens are water resistant, durable and scalable. -- -- 1 a man Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*SMUsT2KCbdjuIh6mxj-52A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*d7YpUiZ-16iQSk2WQ_StZw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:783/1*ZVTtmIlpm-KfjoQ3pAyvEA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:783/1*TyYM6y1Q859hDVPeU0TQRA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:783/0*3jDuOjuGG9N1Zf7e.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:783/0*4gCBIZOserY29k0w.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:783/0*gq9iCFivgQGPjWxJ.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:783/0*q9IND2CNplW9qZMu.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*SMUsT2KCbdjuIh6mxj-52A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*ey3je2oFkPlPASkriEYkXg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*SMUsT2KCbdjuIh6mxj-52A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*fL2XfjiMSJSPP2RaImgQQQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*SMUsT2KCbdjuIh6mxj-52A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*8vNglnBn5AmqRRZUGKX21A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*SMUsT2KCbdjuIh6mxj-52A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*lyC8dIQMsQW_CWRqDkKHPQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*SMUsT2KCbdjuIh6mxj-52A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*_wvc1IOHe1qT5s7-hNm2JQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*wzwnJD8UpPtAd2YoIPEiNQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*TcF9rICJPQZsrzNignSvgw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*I2ObYjzqveyXzEe9QixMPw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*FCSZoy-APX517P8IPmI6pw.png']",3-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@tarikthefirst?source=post_page-----1b2d9a995c4b--------------------------------,57,4 min read

5 Blockchain Myths & Misconceptions Debunked,"A recent survey from HSBC suggests that Blockchain is among the least understood new technologies. Let’s bust some common myths about this technology and its applications!,Myth 01- Blockchain Can Be Used to Transform Anything & Everything,Myth_02- Blockchain is Only a Storage Mechanism,Myth_03- Tokens and Coins are the Same Thing,Myth_04- Blockchain is Bitcoin,Myth_05- Blockchain Can be Scaled Infinitely,Written by Systango"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Systango Follow -- Listen Share Despite being the most hard-hitting buzzword of the present era, a grand number of people are still clueless about the potential and practical applications of Blockchain. Also, equal, if not more, are the people who claim they ‘understand’ all dynamics & intricacies of this new-age tech, but they don’t. And as they say, half knowledge is worse than ignorance. Blockchain, in its crude form, is a type of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) whose append-only nature provides a robust mechanism to store data in data blocks. These blocks are linked cryptographically via hash functions, making it virtually impossible to change data of a particular block without disturbing the rest of the block sequence that followed. Simply put, it’s like a growing set of public record that carries a possibility to disrupt multiple industries and streamline their business operations. Bitcoin & other cryptocurrencies are the most popular use cases of Blockchain. Now, among the good and the bad they say about Blockchain, there are certain misleading ‘facts’ as well which are propagated without second thoughts. Today, we’ll debunk some common myths and misconceptions whirling around Blockchain- Blockchain is like the new big data or AI — too many people are using it as a buzzword and not focused solving a real problem. We like to call them Blockchain tourists! These words from Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse sums up all that we have to say. We agree the code is powerful, but it’s not a solution to all sorts of problems. You need to weigh if your business has scope to introduce a Blockchain innovation or align one with your legacy systems to exploit the power of decentralisation. Ask yourself, will Blockchain enhance consumer consumption? Will it help in cost savings? Will I see a surge in productivity? How many practical use cases are there for my industry? Analyse all aspects effectively and see if Blockchain implementation is worthwhile. Before making any mind, connect with Blockchain experts for a consultation to better recognise the disrupting capabilities of Blockchain for your business. Things people say! By design and definition, Blockchain is a distributed database, making a large number of people think (and believe) that Blockchain is a sophisticated storage mechanism. Let’s burst the bubble- it’s one of the perks that arrives when it’s used as an exchange application. Blockchain wasn’t devised to store your comprehensive data but to store information as a transaction, with which you can see every piece of data generating a hash. The hash can be used to verify the authenticity of that data, thus skyrocketing trust and transparency. Well, they are not. Blockchain has Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) and tokens, and they are not synonymous. Coins bring along a single utility- they act as digital money and can be used to buy or sell things. They can be received, sent, or mined and are not meant to perform any function other than serving as a medium of exchange. Tokens, on the other hand, are digital assets that can have one or more functions inside a project ecosystem. They can act as coins and also represent an asset or utility. We get it- Blockchain gained the recognition it deserves after the unprecedented popularity of Bitcoin. But is Blockchain all about Bitcoin? Absolutely not! One who has familiarity with the potential of Blockchain can tell you in a heartbeat that Bitcoin is just the tip of the iceberg. The real-world applications and use cases of Blockchain are making waves in the digital world and positively impacting multitudinous industries; Finance, Healthcare, and Logistics to name a few. Bitcoin is just a cryptocurrency designed to facilitate secure online transactions. To understand Blockchain beyond Bitcoin, check our blog- 5 Practical Non-Bitcoin Applications of Blockchain Yet another misconception about Blockchain relates with its ability to scale. Blockchain is widely positioned as “growing list of records”, giving an impression that Blockchain can be scaled to an infinite extent. Well, this isn’t the case. Blockchain can’t be scaled, at least now. The decentralised consensus mechanism of Blockchain comes with gold-like benefits- fault tolerance, sky-high security, and political neutrality, but associates the big-time pain of scalability. The number of transactions the blockchain can process cannot exceed that of a single node which is participating in the network. It is also to be noted that with the addition of every new node, the phenomenon of inter-node latency comes into play that makes Blockchain weaker. Hope this clears why Blockchain can’t be scaled endlessly. So, this was our effort to dispel the myths about Blockchain and add more clarity to your knowledge base.

Happy Birthday to Bitcoin!,Written by Coinberry," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Coinberry Follow -- Listen Share There are two dates often considered for the birth of Bitcoin: October 31, 2009 — The Bitcoin Whitepaper is released. January 3, 2010 — The first transaction takes place on the Bitcoin blockchain. The Genesis Block is created. There is some contention in the crypto community as to the true birth date of Bitcoin. We’re proudly in the camp of the first transaction, the first material activity of digital currency and blockchain technology! It’s amazing how much can happen in a decade. The genesis of Bitcoin launched a tidal wave of activity in the crypto space which isnow proudly home to over 2000 digital currencies. As of this writing, Bitcoin has a $67 billion market cap, with millions of transactions — all this activity is indeed a tidal wave of users surfing its wake throughout the internet. Where will the next decade take us? Time will tell. But if the previous decade is an example, we can only count on massive change, with repercussions rippling out into a radically technological future. We are incredibly excited about what will come next, and we do owe our existence to the birth of Bitcoin. Without it, who knows what we would be doing! We’d still be paying for things with fiat … who does that anymore!? As crypto and blockchain continue to garner attention from bigger institutions and the general public we expect the space to thrive on this, to continue to grow, to innovate, to adapt, and to amaze. We’re all in. Will you join us? Happy Birthday, Bitcoin. -- -- A Toronto-based, FINTRAC-registered, cryptocurrency trading platform. 0.5% trading fee, 0% funding fees, 0% withdrawal fees.

A STUDY CASE — OPTIMIZING HVAC IN A FITNESS CHAIN,Written by BEAD Technollogy," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in BEAD Technollogy Follow -- Listen Share Our initial project which was performed with the biggest fitness chain in Turkey addressed our clients’ problems with steadily increasing and unpredictable energy cost at their 40 locations. We started with analyzing one of their location in Istanbul, which runs at 22k Euro monthly energy costs. The problem was that at that location the automation system and the building were basically disconnected from each other, which is a common pattern throughout most locations we have assessed. The automation system was installed with a proxy of maximum assumption of occupancy and no intelligence to adapt. Thus, it catered for service levels assumed to be necessary for 1000 people coming to the location during the day, vs a real life 200 to 350 occupancy at any time. BEAD identified the following patterns and allows to dynamically react to them 1- The location was only occupied after 10.00 a.m. Our dynamic adaptation to real-time occupancy saved the location close to 10% of energy cost. 2- The system registered energy consumption during nighttime due to cleaning and maintenance patterns. Our dynamic adaptation to reflect actual use times saved the location further energy cost. 3- The location featured windows at the roof, getting daylight for significant periods of the any given day. Adjusting another lighting to reflect the natural daylight use we changed the real-time scheduling to the lighting system, yielding a further 8% of energy cost. TOTAL energy cost savings for our customer by using BEAD at this location was more than 20%, effective immediately. We achieved these savings by simply analyzing and connecting the buildings different energy uses with the people living inside on a real-time basis. -- -- BEAD is creating digital twins of buildings by using real-time data and AI in order to optimize the way we use buildings. www.enbead.com Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*NhwiNYloNgzjgTey50cRBg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*xXd_rLCwcBpisTio8KeW9w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*NhwiNYloNgzjgTey50cRBg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2fg-Rah_7cboJ-xklHBnpw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*NhwiNYloNgzjgTey50cRBg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*7Sv824jEiz4c7R2dalltMw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*NhwiNYloNgzjgTey50cRBg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*9skdEM569XqVyJ2L-oyAlw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*NhwiNYloNgzjgTey50cRBg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*L5TGnvGK-ky1Uw8Vt6V3BA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*NhwiNYloNgzjgTey50cRBg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*vzu3JPzaq2EZKTZNY9BhLA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*lEmL62oZdrOOWIzAAFKiFg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*i2zLIwC9mftamP1dbciCeQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*TQlEMeYwwWc38Wqm7EfCTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*0-N4JrXpZG1KJfIrAutd3A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg']",3-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@bead?source=post_page-----dc4087043b50--------------------------------,2,2 min read

The Biggest Technology Failures of 2018,"From gene-edited babies to guaranteed-fatal brain uploads, it was a bumper year for technology misfires and misuses,Written by MIT Technology Review,CRISPR Babies"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story MIT Technology Review Follow MIT Technology Review -- 9 Share By Antonio Regalado It was the year that technology — and the people who create it — seemingly could do no right, and did much that was wrong. As one of my sources put it in a tweet reacting to a dumb tech stunt, “2018 can’t end soon enough.” For the past few years MIT Technology Review has published a list of what we consider the most pointless or destructive uses of technology (here are 2017, 2016, 2015, and 2014). This year, though, the naughty were naughtier and the wrongs seemed wronger: technology was used to spread hate and addiction, to justify suicide, and to experiment on newborn children. Here’s our list of the very worst. We all knew that gene-edited humans would one day be born, but nobody wanted it to happen so soon, and definitely not like this.

More or Less Alone?,Written by Serena Golden," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Serena Golden Follow -- Listen Share 7,674,374,208 is the number of people currently populating our modern world, yet millions have never felt more alone. We live in a hyperconnected generation in which we have the ability to contact another person instantaneously, whether he lives five minutes or five hours from us. The internet is a platform for unique individuals to relate to users who share common interests or hobbies. It is a place to stay informed about current events. It is a scaffold where human beings can learn, watch, or read about any topic they desire. Nevertheless, as the internet becomes increasingly accessible around the globe — connecting billions of strangers — users tend to put their best faces forward, concealing the reality of the somber emotions behind it. Sadly, this is one explanation as to why depression and suicide rates are higher than ever. With each new application on the market that promises happiness amongst users, society is being deceived into becoming more and more addicted to their phones. This sport, which consists of scrolling and streaming, spurs isolation from friends and family; thus leaving the most important type of connections — human interactions — as one of our lowest priorities. Between 2010 and 2016 the number of adolescents who suffered major episodes of depression and loneliness increased by 60%. This considerable growth can be attributed to the enslavement teens feel towards their phones since the launch of the iPhone in 2007, Facebook in 2004, Instagram in 2010, Twitter in 2006, and Snapchat in 2011. Our overwhelming obsession with posting, liking, and scrutinizing every moment has gotten out of control. The new reality is that instead of watching concerts, we record them; in place of eating delicious meals, we photograph them; rather than joking with our friends, we tag them. Ultimately, we prefer to view life rather than experience it. As a teenager, I constantly hear my parents reminisce about the times they would play outside until sundown, only returning home to eat at the dinner table with their own parents. This may seem like a cheesy scene out of an old movie, but devoting time to spend with family (a tradition that many have given up on) used to be an integral part of many children’s lives. Research from the Journal of Marriage and Family shows that teens who allocate quality time for their families tend to lead happier lives. Despite this fact, young adults consistently give up sharing stories at the dinner table in favor of locking themselves in a dark room and binging-watching Netflix shows. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide rates for white and black children between the ages 10 and 17 have increased by 70% and 77%, respectively, between 2006 and 2016. Unfortunately, our generation withholds the knowledge necessary to take action and stop trends similar to these from developing, but we don’t know how to enforce it. What should be a simple task — setting down our devices and seeing the world with our own two eyes — isn’t as straightforward as it seems. Tech gurus specialize in pumping out new games and features that light up our reward centers, making it feel artificially good for us to zone into the harsh fluorescent screen. Yet, it is these Silicon Valley innovators who find themselves instituting tech-free homes for the sake of their children’s health and happiness. If the experts are also the ones who most fear the internet’s vast capabilities, shouldn’t that be a clear warning to change our habits? We used a tool designed to enhance our well being to aid in our mental destruction. It is our obligation to resist the seclusion of the omnipresent cyberworld so we do not miss out on the lives we deserve. -- -- Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:900/1*_LgTNfPJUCttgm2tJrwEPA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*bYr2D-7UM6IrN9ry.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/0*9WM0HZVz50tXKk7S', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:900/0*NfzLX2TB6csdONdO', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/0*bYr2D-7UM6IrN9ry.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*sHhfi_Vi4sfayTGAIFvxWg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*jZ-UoXKjxWBsJIUsEMhvcQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*v8rpO5QZbACurOTUbdepKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*TAT3_RDbRiGdS_Zk', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*VPR_YstTgKqQpTaDDW6KHA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*-vHpCFLc_N7t1O966IK72g.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*nChshyHhYer985FIUWu6TA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*maC8NLpto3tNwluhoRODsw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg']",3-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@serena.golden_17349?source=post_page-----f5d9b21f3c6a--------------------------------,300,3 min read
Consensus: Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake,Written by Sara Mohammed," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Sara Mohammed Follow The Finterra Publication -- Listen Share One of the key features of blockchain is its consensus mechanism. Necessary for the distributed ledger to function is ensuring the entire network of participants collectively agree with the terms of the contract. The purpose of the consensus is to verify the validity of the information being added to the ledger, to prevent double spending and other invalid data from being appended to the blockchain and to keep the network from being derailed through forking. There are a number of different consensus mechanisms out there. The most popular are the Proof of Work and Proof of Stake systems. All of them aim to solve the Byzantine Generals’ Problem but none of them provide a perfect solution. What is the Byzantine Generals’ Problem The definition of the Byzantine Generals’ Problem is best defined on CoinCentral as “a term etched from the computer science description of a situation where involved parties must agree on a single strategy in order to avoid complete failure, but where some of the involved parties are corrupt and disseminating false information or are otherwise unreliable.” The Byzantine armies surround a city, ready to invade but they need to attack at the same time. The city is not strong enough to fight back against the entire Byzantine army. But the Byzantine army will only win if they attack at the same time. To make a decision, the generals of each army have to send a messenger back and forth to deliver the message. If the messenger gets caught or sends the wrong message, the Byzantine army will fail. There is no way to guarantee the authenticity of the message. How do they create a trustless system that ensures victory in attacking the city? Proof of Work (PoW) The first solution to the Byzantine Generals’ Problem was with Bitcoin’s Proof of Work (PoW). To verify a transaction and add it to a block, it needs expensive computation and mining. This has a number of problems as it consumes a high amount of electricity and energy worldwide. Companies running on PoW are not as decentralised due to the better opportunities given to individuals that have faster and more powerful ASICs. So bigger mining pool can team up with one another to launch a 51% on the network. Proof of Stake (PoS) Compared to Proof of Work, Proof of Stake is an alternative that requires less cost and energy. This mechanism achieves a general agreement on blocks while also retaining a large validator pool for security. Proof of Stake is based on validators staking and locking a number of tokens in escrow, thereby giving them the right to become a validator. With PoS, a validator can put his or her money in different chains without fear of punishment, a problem called “nothing at stake”. Blockchains like Finterra’s GALLACTIC Blockchain have already found a way to tackle this issue through a process called “token slashing”. If a validator is caught acting in a violating manner, their staked GTX (GALLACTIC’s tokens) are forfeit and destroyed. This model gives validators incentive to cooperate and refrain from acting in a malicious manner. Moving forward In any centralised system, a central authority maintains and updates a database. In comparison, public blockchains that operate as decentralised systems work without a single authority. They involve contributions from hundreds of thousands of validators who work on verifying and authenticating transactions that are taking place on the technology. This blockchain solution reduces risk of corruption and fraud. So, which consensus mechanism is the best? We can only leave that up to the individual, but PoS seems to be inching ahead until a more viable option surfaces. -- -- The Finterra Publication Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:7500/1*8s1mikuv2TJVZAyWCKzhTw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*hIj6YMiYZEbIX_KCzdJIFQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*yIaRbiqMwGGAXR9ZMe2-dw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*hIj6YMiYZEbIX_KCzdJIFQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*yIaRbiqMwGGAXR9ZMe2-dw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*AmrWNBDBIfJ2j0shirIC3Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*hIj6YMiYZEbIX_KCzdJIFQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*Psnka02MhnzVGphckMl13Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*e2fxqpSNScda2UQW-CcZcQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*caR7Emhf3oDrz8gvil3cPw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*e2fxqpSNScda2UQW-CcZcQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*EG5hPUwnKc5SdYoJllLjBg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*hIj6YMiYZEbIX_KCzdJIFQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*QtSp-QdCNWNysIIwz-tQSA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*lOVIKQR7sxSghI8VuTAbHw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*cBIFfjjqzx8pzaemnAM0rQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*EhiV5eo34TIkvI6u-JFYmg.jpeg']",3-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@sara.moh.f2018?source=post_page-----6bcd7ea6da68--------------------------------,0,3 min read
"Smoking or Sitting, which is worse?","Written by Vivametrica Blog,It is well-established that smoking is hazardous to human health and is a major preventable cause of premature deaths."," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Vivametrica Blog Follow -- Listen Share For years now, researchers have confirmed that smoking increases one’s risk of mortality. Both heavy smoking, and more recently low-intensity smoking have been linked to increased occurrences of death in various populations. It has also been said that “sitting is the new smoking”, that sedentary behavior is just as bad for one’s health. Internal studies conducted by our data science team have shown that sitting, is actually in fact worse. Vivametrica’s founders have been studying the effects of physical activity on health and chronic disease for over 20 years, this research has been the basis of our proprietary risk analytics. More interest in studying the impact of sedentary behavior on human health has arisen. Sedentary behavior has been shown to be an independent predictor of mortality in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Another study, which looked at the combined effects of watching TV with smoking found these factors to be co-morbid in cancer-related mortality. Vivametrica conducted a study using 10-year mortality data to compare our risk prediction model to a traditional insurance risk model (>2000 person sample). The initial data sample, including wearable device data, was collected 10 years ago. As part of this study, we also performed individual variable assessments to determine the effects of specific factors on mortality. Steps-per-day (habitual physical activity) was the strongest predictor of mortality. Individuals who took fewer steps than the average for their age and gender were 5.4x more likely to die after 10 years compared to those who took more steps. When we looked at smoking status alone, we found that smokers were 1.2x more likely to die after 10 years compared to non-smokers. From these results, it can be said that physical activity has a greater impact on overall all-cause mortality than smoking in this study. Thus, increasing efforts to modify sedentary behavior with smoking cessation can help people to live longer. Getting people to move more seems to have an even bigger impact than stopping cigarette use.

What is a DApp?,Written by PumaPay," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in PumaPay Follow -- Listen Share An entirely new breed of apps is gaining momentum, DApps. DApps are not owned by anyone, they run on the blockchain, and technically their backend code is running on a decentralized P2P network. Crypto pundits and the community defined criteria that a DApp needs to meet in order to be considered the obvious, a decentralized app. First, it must be open source and the source code of the app to be available to all network participants, and anyone can check and contribute to the code. Secondly, it has to use blockchain technology to record transactions which anyone can refer to at any given point. Thirdly, it needs to be fueled by tokens or digital assets. Lastly, it needs to generate tokens and have an inbuilt consensus mechanism like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS). DApps propose a paradigm shift in the way we view software models. A world running on decentralized apps will be remapping the technological landscape. Why? Just because they are distributed, transparent and incentivized mechanisms open to all network users. The increasing development of DApps has opened up the possibility of an exciting new world, dominated by decentralized gaming apps like CryptoRome, Endless Dice and Steem Monsters as well as token exchanges such as IDEX, Bancor and Kyber. On the contrary, not all crypto space-related apps survive or end up delivering on their technological ambitions. Although, the crypto environment has given a plethora of ICOs and ideas, over time these have faded. After the 2017–2018 hype in new ICOs, only few of the original and innovative projects survived. As we move into 2019, there is still a lot of work that needs to be done as the majority of DApps do not, yet, appeal to the vast majority of people. Have an opinionated take on this?

5 Ways to Democratize Access to Clean Energy Technology,"Written by Elemental Excelerator,1. Advance Access to Community Solar,2. Widen the Usage of Energy Storage,3. Upgrade Inefficient Buildings,4. Increase Mobility Options for Low-Income Consumers,5. Advocate for More Clean Energy Policies with Disadvantaged Communities in Mind"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Elemental Excelerator Follow Elemental Excelerator -- Listen Share California recently became the second state to pass a 100% clean energy standard, three years after Hawaii passed a similar law. As the fifth largest economy in the world, California has a tall order to fill in terms of making the transition to clean energy. How can California, and other states that wish to follow suit, fulfill this ambitious task? They will need to provide affordable, relevant, and accessible energy options to every one of its residents, prioritizing those who have historically been overlooked and left out of the clean energy conversation due to economic circumstance or social inequity. To reach this goal in a proactive way, at Elemental Excelerator, we have identified the following opportunities and tools to apply in our work: By strategically outlining targets, problems, solutions, and impact, we can more quickly focus in on where to deploy funding and resources. This has also helped us identify 5 ways California can democratize access to clean technologies: 80% of Americans do not have access to rooftop solar. Providing options for those who are locked out of the solar market — either due to renting, apartment restrictions, or lack of access to consistent solar energy — will be essential to achieving a clean energy future. Companies such as Solstice Power Technologies, Elemental Excelerator’s recent cohort company, are engaging customers with low-cost community solar options and working with community-based organizations to make the benefits of solar easy to understand. Another company, Arcadia Power, is building America’s first digital utility that allows consumers to switch to clean energy, and will be providing community solar as one of their main offerings. Building energy storage solutions in low-income communities increases resiliency and widens access to renewable energy sources. It allows property owners to better manage energy demand, thus lowering peak demand charges and their overall utility bills. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) recently widened the coverage of California’s virtual net metering tariff to include storage with solar systems. While still new, the concept of community energy storage has been introduced to allow greater access to renewable energy. Community energy storage has been loosely defined by the California Public Utilities Commission as “storage connected at the distribution feeder level, associated with a cluster of customer load.” Community storage has the potential to mirror community solar in terms of the way it is distributed among customers in partnership with solar. In Sacramento, the pilot project of the Anatolia III Solar Smart Homes Community consists of 15 residential batteries in connection with solar and three larger units. This helps to smooth customer load profiles and control the distributed sources of energy. Most recently, PG&E announced they will be replacing three natural-gas power plants with lithium-ion batteries from Tesla. This will be the largest installation of batteries in the world, and the first time a utility has replaced power plants with a renewable energy resource. Battery costs have been declining by as much as 32% in 2015 and 2016, making them more accessible to a wider range of customers — both residential and commercial. The costs of other energy storage sources have decreased as well, including pumped hydro, flywheels, and flow batteries. Adding storage technologies to the proliferation of solar across America and the world will provide not only resiliency to the grid, but also a faster financial return due to the control over peak power demand. With more distributed and intermittent resources coming online, batteries will be a key resource to achieving any ambitious renewable portfolio standard. Older buildings are often the least energy efficient, costing residents (often low- to moderate-income ones) high electricity bills. Communities impacted by these high costs are also likely to be disproportionately impacted by pollution, and struggle with air quality issues due to their proximity to high-polluting refineries, freeways, and industrial activities. Efficient buildings and smart homes can enable a lower cost of operation in these communities, while also improving indoor air quality. BlocPower, a company based out of Brooklyn, New York and another Elemental Excelerator portfolio company, is aggregating blocks of buildings in financially underserved communities to provide energy efficiency audits and retrofits. By grouping buildings together, they lower the risk of project financing and offer discounts to fund the projects. This accelerates the timeline of installing energy efficiency projects beyond what each building would have been able to achieve alone. By lowering the total energy demand required to power buildings in communities disproportionately impacted by pollution, we can help improve quality of life, create cost savings for those who need it most, and reach a cleaner energy future faster. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, transportation is the second largest consumer expense after housing. Many low-income communities have minimal access to reliable, affordable, and clean transportation. Providing alternative and affordable transportation options is key to not only achieving a clean energy future, but also to paving pathways out of poverty. BlueLA, an electric vehicle (EV) sharing company, was selected by the City of Los Angeles to operate a program that brings EV car sharing to low-income communities. Not only did the company begin operations in low-income communities, but it also offers discounted prices to low-income qualified customers. Kick scooters, bike shares, and scooters have exploded onto the streets and sidewalks of many major cities. But until now, these options have only been available to people with credit cards and smartphones. While smartphones have become more accessible, about 50% of people with subprime credit scores do not have a credit card. New mobility start-ups are beginning to experiment with cash options that allow non-credit card owners to access their electric scooters and bikes. These scooters and bikes can provide critical last-mile options between commuters’ homes and places of work. In fact, one USC study found that shortening the time it takes to get to transit stops using methods such as e-bikes and scooters can double the number of jobs available within a 30 minute commute. Private corporations and nonprofits, as well as individuals, can further accelerate progress toward providing clean technologies by working with policymakers to support and pass regulations that promote equitable access. Many of the solutions above were designed and implemented due to some regulation or combination of policies. Some examples include: Approximately one in five California households lives at or below the federal poverty level — $32,000 for a family of two. Excluding this population means leaving a huge market behind that is key to achieving a 100% clean energy future. None of the above solutions alone will get California to a clean and equitable future. Progress requires a community of supporters, businesses, non-profits, and government organizations building a system of intertwined and coordinated resources. We hope you will join the efforts to accelerate the equitable access of clean technologies.

VNT Weekly | VNT Chain Project Progress (Goodbye 2018 Hello 2019),"Project Updates,Community Updates,Development Progress,Hello 2019,Written by VNT Chain Labs"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in VNT Chain Labs Follow VNT Chain Labs -- Listen Share VNT WEEKLY, December 31 This is the weekly report of VNT Chain in which you will find about the latest project updates, community news and development progress. It would be a great honor for us to share exciting news and build the ecology with you! Yunphant Blockchain — Yu Zhibei: Blockchain solves e-commerce pain points in four ways On Friday December 28, Yu Zhibei, the co-founder of Yunphant Blockchain, was invited to participate in the 23rd issue of “Hangzhou E-commerce Innovation and Entrepreneurship Salon” sponsored by Hangzhou Municipal Council of Commerce, bringing a wonderful theme “Blockchain Best Practice”. Mr Yu had panel discussion about the topic of “E-commerce cross-border blockchain; Application scene iteration and upgrade” with other experts and audiences, and made in-depth analysis of the blockchain in the specific e-commerce scenarios. He believes that e-commerce can open up information flow, logistics and capital flow by implementing blockchain technology.

What is Node.js ? What can you do with it ?,"Table of Contents,Written by Toru Eguchi,What is Node.js ?,What can you do with Node.js ?"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Toru Eguchi Follow -- Share If you are a beginner of JavaScript, you have heard that JavaScript can be used in front-end and back-end. But the first question is “How is JavaScript executed both in front-end and back-end?”. For front-end, it’s much easier to understand it because JavaScript is executed by browser. What about back-end ? Without browser, how JavaScript is executed ? So it’s time to learn Node.js ! Node.js is a program allowing you to run JavaScript outside of browser. It means that if you install Node.js, you can run JavaScript on your PC, on your server.Technically, Node.js is built with Chrome’s V8 engine which is written in C++. It compiles and executes JavaScript. If you want to know more about V8 engine, please go here. Here are main 4 things you can do with Node.js. Take a look at it. -- -- I am a full-stack engineer.

"Week of December 23, 2018 — This Week in the Gig Economy","TaskRabbit expands its reach in the UK.,Recession is on its way — How will the gig economy react?,America is running low on blue-collar workers,Written by werkapp,Gig Economy Development,Labour Market Update"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in werkapp Follow This Week in the Gig Economy (presented by werkapp) -- Listen Share In this publication of This Week in the Gig Economy, we’re covering topics ranging from the large trends in the Global Labour Market and the latest developments with large gig economy companies. Without further ado: IKEA owned company which connects residents with local ‘taskers’ has launched in six more cities in the UK. This more than doubles the number of cities the company serves in the England and Wales. The new areas are Brighton, Cardiff, Coventry, Liverpool & Warrington, Oxford and Reading. The company is expected to announce its expansion in Scotland in early 2019. On one hand, the gig economy has been booming during this economic expansion of nearly a decade. Investors are on a lookout for the Uber and Lyft IPO in early 2019, with Airbnb and Instacart to follow. On the other hand, it seems like we are headed towards another recession. How will the gig economy react in this mist of all this? “run for cover.” Alan Greenspan recent warning to the investors. Even though, some experts say that recession could go in favor of the gig world as more and more people will see it as a necessity to pick up gigs and make extra income. Adam Roseman, Co-founder and CEO of Steady has different views. He says that the recession, which brings both layoffs and wage cuts, would increase the supply of workers even further with fewers gigs to pick up. In a nutshell, there’s no doubt a recession will leave more people looking for gig work, it could also deflate the gig economy. Feel free to read his full analysis here. The U.S. is currently dealing with a very tight labor market. And blue-collar jobs, in particular, are experiencing an acute worker shortage. Conference Board Chief Economist Gad Levanon told Yahoo Finance that there are “three big trends happening simultaneously” causing the relatively shrinking pool of workers: Demographics, education, and continued demand for services. “The baby boom generation is much larger than the generations before and after,” Levanon said of the demographic aspect. “Now is the time they are retiring in large numbers.” In terms of education, blue-collar labor markets are tight is because more and more Americans are going to college. Since the Financial Crisis, “the share of 23- to 24-year-olds with a bachelor’s degree has been rising sharply,” the Conference Board reported. Those with a bachelor’s degree are less likely to pursue a blue-collar career. “To put it bluntly,” the Conference Board stated, “there are simply not enough people in the labor force willing to work in blue-collar jobs.” Feel free to watch the full interview here. :) If you would like to receive our weekly newsletter in your email, please subscribe below. -- -- This Week in the Gig Economy (presented by werkapp) werkapp is making temporary staffing as easy as a click of a button.

Technology is making us stupid,Written by Nathan James," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Nathan James Follow -- Listen Share The world 50 years ago compared to modern days is an entirely different atmosphere. Grandparents would read books and newspapers, all being beneficial to the to the mind. Now, people will stare at a cell phone; reading what they see on social media, becoming highly influenced by mythical statements created only to play devils advocate with whomever they please for attention. The effects of AI or technology is creating psychological disabilities beginning with millennial's and spreading throughout other generations. millennial's grew up with easy access to technology such as smartphones and mobile laptops, thus becoming part of their everyday life. That created anxiety, depression, and shortening attention spans. Technology is becoming a toxic innovation to the growing society weakening morals and sensitivity to violent acts towards people. Living in a world where technology does not exist is nearly impossible. A day without an alarm clock, cell phone, or computers has become unfathomable to adolescents. Essentially, the pace of technological advances has immensely increased over the last few decades to ease our lives and provide us more opportunities. It is undeniable that technology has changed our lives, tech critics argue that the Internet and other related technological gadgets have a deleterious effect on the human brain performance . However, tech critics only see one side of technology and neglect to mention the new intelligence that technologies have brought us. Furthermore, the existence of technology has made an incredible difference in the generation we live in by transforming global development, improving people’s lives and sparking innovation. A well-known professor from California State University named Larry Rosen, has created a correlated term to use for the diagnosis he calls an iDisorder. An iDisorder is where you exhibit signs and symptoms of a psychiatric disorder such as OCD, narcissism, addiction or even ADHD, which are manifested through your use — or overuse — of technology. Nicholas Carr is a brilliant writer who strongly believes and has a firm vision of the internet’s neurological effect on the brain. Throughout his article, “Is Google Making Us Stupid?” he feels that “the deep reading that used to come naturally has become a struggle” due to the rise of the internet. Carr reflects on his own experience of his years spent online and blames the internet for being the reason why he tends to get “fidgety” after two or three pages. He makes a big assumption that the internet is responsible for the rest of the society’s declined critical thinking. The dynamic of the internet alone demands the technique of skimming, we are losing the ability to read deeply and, by implication, to think deeply. Adolescents whom grew up with various amounts of technology do not have the chance to develop critical thought and creativity; weakening vital skills needed to survive in the world. The way people use social media and internet is bouncing from one place to another, making it extremely difficult to concentrate on one task such as simply reading a novel. Nickolas Carr admits “I can’t read War and Peace anymore” Before technology was yet to exist, face-to-face interactions were a normal everyday encounter. Today's society there are severe cases of social anxiety. The unceasing celebration of the self — epitomized by the “selfie” photograph — has atomized and alienated the individual. Before, people would start off the day by looking at someone of importance to them such as a mother or significant other, nowadays the majority will start the off by subconsciously looking at a cellphone or some sort of gadget. Statistically, it takes approximately 21 days to create a habit. Which is silently lethal for anybody to own a mobile device. They become addicted to looking at their phone every 5 minutes, or waking up and checking social media feed, same thing for post sleeping. It has created problems in the educational system; students have been granted easy access to the internet utilities and have allowed them to easily locate, copy and paste answers into their homework assignments. The effects of exposure caused some to not be aware that it is creating reliability. Access to the internet has made plagiarism a part of several students’ academic careers, within has a contradiction, that being technology is a huge distraction from student staying focused on homework. The invention of technology main purpose was to fill void, need, or want, creating an environment of simplicity. But, as technology grew it brought with it disorders, addiction and cognitive loss. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have slowly become a faster and more convenient way of sharing news, communication with friends and relatives across the world. Although citizen journalism has now become so cheap that anyone with a smart phone can transmit news anyhow, there have been instances where people have come to know of the gruesome deaths of their relatives and friends through uncensored posts on Facebook or WhatsApp. However, social media has became quite demoralizing and exposing the world to horribleness. Exposure to these types of graphic content develops immunization to what is known to be morally incorrect. In today's time, most of the human aspects of life revolve and are controlled or affected in someway by technology. Many people would find it hard to cook without microwaves. Technology had a goal originally set in place; it was to simply make human life easier, and it did in some ways, however the simplicity became a habit to the way people live their everyday lives. People became reluctant without it, something so simple as to driving from point A to B became a challenge without the use of a GPS or smartphone. History tells us that in the long run technology is a net creator of jobs. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, Space X, The Boring Company, and former co-owner of PayPal, has created many jobs for the economy, however, in the Tesla Factory Elon Musk made it to be a highly-touted automation system. Which he thought to be better, more intelligent standard for Tesla manufacturing. He soon realized that “excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake. To be precise, [his] mistake. Humans are underrated. Technology cannot replace humans. Human brains and methods of doing certain thing cannot be replaced by artificial intelligence. However, artificial intelligence creates complications to a person life, creating dependency on malfunctioning technologies. Tesla known for its self-driving automobile. Soon enough humans will rely on autopilot to get them from point A to B, slowly draining the once strong knowledge of driving a car. Technological advances in big data, machine learning, and robotics, have begun to have a negative influence on existing employment opportunities for human beings. With the technology and artificial technology advancing at a rapid pace it elements people from the workplace. People won’t have to work, therefore loosing knowledge of how one does a certain job. Knowledge is one of the key factors to life, not knowing or becoming forgetful, causes harm to civilization. Technology immensely effects our culture in several ways, Entire generations are growing up under a pre-Copernican notion that the world revolves around them, thus the constant updates of what they are doing, where they are going, what they’ve purchased. It puts those generations at risk of not knowing, increased levels of complications and competitiveness to obtain an occupation. Technology is becoming a toxic innovation to the growing society weakening morals and sensitivity to violent acts in people. Adolescents have been severely brainwashed, to the point of unawareness that technology has consumed, controlled, and distracted them from life itself. Technology has made our mind sensitive to oneself, have been creating a personality and different person behind a screen. Humans developed the tactic of hiding behind a screen to speak their opinion. People isolate themselves from society due to technology addiction that created psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and weakened attention spans. Technology put people to harm, removing them from their place of work. Artificial intelligence is creating replacements for humans, causing loss of knowledge for one’s skilled occupation. -- -- Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:88:88/0*ThszwI1P88-uosC0', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:144:144/0*ThszwI1P88-uosC0', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*dkIqCy6mNQcOqEZAKj_qcg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*ThszwI1P88-uosC0', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*yuVzMhCJyDENbyhwAsrkwA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*ThszwI1P88-uosC0', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*vzu3JPzaq2EZKTZNY9BhLA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*lEmL62oZdrOOWIzAAFKiFg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*i2zLIwC9mftamP1dbciCeQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*niQ0sAwUszuyNMyH.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*pZPMtIONqtJYi2xHYD_Ivg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg']",3-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@nathan.james?source=post_page-----7777ae670ee--------------------------------,50,6 min read
Intelligence Artificielle et Marchés Financiers,"Written by Alexis Tabary,Intelligence Artificielle et Abus de marché,Les conditions d’imputabilité"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Alexis Tabary Follow -- Share En matière d’abus de marché, l’IA vient poser de nouveaux défis juridiques. Ces nouveaux défis ne résultent pas de la création de nouvelles méthodes de réalisation d’abus de marché, mais du fait que les nouvelles technologies, et notamment l’Intelligence Artificielle, font que ceux-ci prennent une toute autre dimension. Au sens du Règlement n°596/2014 [1], l’abus de marché se décompose de plusieurs catégories d’infractions : les opérations d’initiés, la divulgation illicite d’informations privilégiées, et les manipulations de marchés. Si les deux premières catégories relèvent d’un accès suivi d’une divulgation d’informations non publiques dont par conséquent l’IA ne peut avoir connaissance et ne peut donc générer de risques systémiques sur les marchés, cela n’est pas le cas pour la troisième catégorie. Les manipulations de marché sont définies, à travers d’une liste non-exhaustive, à l’article 12 du Règlement, remplaçant les articles 631 et suivants du Règlement général de l’AMF. Il y est notamment mentionné certaines manipulations de cours auxquelles il faut être particulièrement attentif dès lors qu’il y a usage du Trading algorithmique à haute fréquence, (par exemple à l’article 12 2.c du Règlement). Nous étudierons, au prisme de la pratique de Market-on-the-close (A) et de celle de l’Abusive Squeeze (B), en quoi l’Intelligence Artificielle (en sa définition la plus inclusive possible) génère déjà des abus de marché afin d’illustrer les risques encourus par les marchés financiers dans le cadre d’une généralisation de ces agents autonomes. IA et Marking-the-close Le Marking-the-close[1bis] est le fait pour un agent financier de réaliser « des achats d’actions ou de dérivés à un instant très proche de fermeture du marché de façon à altérer le prix de clôture »[2]. Si un tel procédé n’est pas illégal en soi, la répétition de celui-ci dans des proportions permettant une influence sur les cours peut constituer une manipulation de cours. De plus, un tel procédé est suspecté a fortiori de manipulation de cours s’il est suivi d’annulations des ordres passés. Car, pour tout investisseur extérieur, les informations disponibles sur l’état du marché de l’actif financier visé sont celles répertoriées dans le carnet d’ordres passés. Dès lors, pour une entreprise réalisant ce type de procédé, le fait d’effectuer cela à grande échelle entraîne que « la représentation pour tout opérateur du carnet d’ordres et de l’état de l’offre et de la demande […] est faussée (sic) »[3]. En effet, compte tenu du caractère anonyme des opérations passées, « l’algorithme (peut) interpréter les flux de marché avantageusement par rapport aux autres intervenants » dès lors que seul l’émetteur de l’ordre est en mesure d’identifier ses propres ordres et donc d’avoir une vision réelle des ordres qui seront par la suite maintenus et effectués. Si à ce jour, l’utilisation de ces procédés d’émission puis d’annulation d’ordres est marginale dans la mesure où le THF [3bis] demeure assez peu utilisé sur les marchés peu liquides, la généralisation des THF parmi les acteurs financiers risque d’entraîner une certaine volatilité de la valeur des valeurs financières. En effet, dans la mesure où un THF est actuellement en mesure de réaliser durant les 2 dernières secondes avant la fixation des ordres pour déterminer le prix de clôture de l’indice NASDAQ près de 70% des ordres passés dans les dernières secondes [4], dans la mesure où un grand nombre des ordres émis sont par la suite annulés, la multiplication des acteurs pouvant opérer cette volumétrie d’opérations et poursuivant la même stratégie peut amener à une incertitude de l’état réel du marché sur une valeur financière. Au travers de l’affaire SEC v. Athena Research Capital LLC, nous pouvons percevoir en quoi l’Intelligence Artificielle vient perturber et accroître les risques d’abus de marché, en ce sens que les ordres sont émis à des moments de plus en plus proches de l’heure de fixation du prix de clôture, sans compter la multiplication du nombre d’ordres, complexifiant alors le travail de contrôle des teneurs de marchés. IA et Abusive Squeeze L’Abusive Squeeze[5] est le fait pour un agent financier d’user « d’une influence significative sur l’offre, la demande ou les mécanismes de livraison d’un instrument financier ou du produit sous-jacent d’un contrat dérivé, de façon à (en) distordre le prix »[6]. Si le fait d’avoir une influence significative sur une valeur financière n’est pas constitutif d’une manipulation de cours en soi, le fait d’en abuser afin d’influer sur les prix de façon à réaliser un profit en instillant une information de nature à induire en erreur tout autre investisseur sur l’état de l’offre et la demande de la valeur concernée constitue bien une manipulation de cours. Ainsi, le fait d’« effectuer une transaction, passer un ordre ou adopter tout autre comportement qui donne ou est susceptible de donner des indications fausses ou trompeuses en ce qui concerne l’offre, la demande ou le cours d’un instrument financier, d’un contrat au comptant sur matières premières qui lui est lié ou d’un produit ou d’un produit mis aux enchères sur la base des quotas d’émission »[7] est qualifié de manipulation de cours. Or, à cet effet, l’influence significative peut s’entendre comme étant absolue ou relative. Une influence significative absolue implique que l’agent financier est : à l’achat, celui ayant exercé la majorité des ordres sur la période de cotation, à la vente, celui qui dispose de la majorité des valeurs financières du marché ; une influence significative relative s’entend alors comme étant la position majoritaire d’un agent financier sur une période restreinte déterminée lui permettant d’influer sur le cours de cotation. Si l’influence absolue est sanctionnée et assez rapidement repérable, l’influence relative est plus difficile à relever dans la mesure où il faut déterminer la période restreinte en question. Ainsi, dans l’affaire SEC v. Athena Capital Research LLC[8], la période restreinte pour la détermination de l’influence significative portait sur 5 secondes. L’utilisation de l’Intelligence Artificielle, par le THF, raccourcit les délais de comparaison, la technologie aidant à exercer un impact significatif sur de courtes périodes. Par ailleurs, dans le cadre d’un Abusive Squeeze, le bénéfice de l’influence significative peut être indirect, rendant alors encore plus compliqué la détection d’une telle manipulation de cours. En effet, il est possible de chercher à manipuler un cours à la hausse ou à la baisse afin d’accroître ou réduire une performance qui est l’objet d’un contrat financier et dont dépendra le montant numéraire que la contrepartie versera. Or, dans l’affaire SEC v.Athena Capital Research LLC, l’algorithme était programmé pour réaliser des manipulations de cours à échéance et sur des valeurs humainement déterminées, la numérisation des opérations ainsi que la centralisation au sein de portefeuilles des différentes opérations rend possible qu’une IA en charge de façon autonome de la gestion d’un fonds [8bis] puisse opérer en corrélation avec les positions déjà prises par l’entreprise à des fins d’optimisation des revenus. Il apparaît donc aujourd’hui sensible l’absence de séparations quant aux systèmes utilisés par les opérateurs numériques et ceux par les opérateurs humains. Une certaine séparation permettrait d’avoir une présomption d’absence de manipulation de cours à des fins de maximisation de bénéfices indirects. Ainsi que nous l’avons vu, l’IA est source de potentiels risques sur les marchés économiques et financiers. La généralisation des intelligences artificielles au sein des divers agents financiers peut conduire à divers abus, dont certains sont déjà pratiqués dans le cadre du THF. A ce titre, certains acteurs des marchés financiers craignent que l’IA engendrent des risques systémiques[9], du fait de la volatilité que la multiplication des intelligences artificielles provoquerait sur les marchés. Mais également, l’IA pourrait conduire à une restriction de concurrence sur le marché bancaire et financier, du fait de la non-disponibilité des données relatives à la clientèle. Cette restriction de concurrence pourrait alors engendrer une situation d’oligopole entretenant des ententes implicites. Or, toute la difficulté, sur le plan juridique, est, en addition de la démonstration de l’existence de manquements, de pouvoir l’imputer à un acteur. Ainsi que vu précédemment, l’IA est susceptible de générer des risques d’infractions. Si les infractions précédemment citées sont sanctionables en cas d’actions humainement intentées, on peut néanmoins constater des difficultés sur l’imputabilité de ces infractions en présence d’une IA. Aussi, l’enjeu principal dès lors que les autorités initient une action de répréhension est l’identification de la personne juridique à qui l’infraction est imputée. l’IA ne disposant pas de personnalité juridique propre elle ne peut donc être incriminée. Dès lors, il faut déterminer la personne à incriminer des actions générées par une IA (A). Par ailleurs, les infractions exposées précédemment supposent, dans leur condamnation maximale, la présence d’une intention manifeste de l’agent économique d’enfreindre la loi. Or, dans le cas d’une IA autonome, l’intention peut s’avérer délicate à déterminer (B). L’identification de la personne à incriminer Dans la mesure où les sanctions d’abus de marchés sont de nature pénale, on peut déterminer que l’émergence de Fintech, basée sur une IA actrice de marché, rend inopérante la législation actuelle. En effet, la force de la sanction pénale est la crainte de la contrainte par corps, et conduit donc à une certaine pression psychologique sur les divers acteurs de marché. Bien qu’il soit déjà possible de sanctionner une personne n’ayant aucune existence physique (personne morale), la contrainte par corps s’exerce néanmoins à l’encontre du dirigeant responsable, la pression psychologique n’étant pas alors diffuse au sein de la personne morale, au contraire de la sanction « administrative ». Dans la mesure où l’IA ne peut être contrainte par corps, cette nature pénale de la sanction est de fait inopérante. La rationalisation des comportements d’abus de marché par une IA conduit nécessairement à ne pas rendre en compte l’aléa moral des comportements humains, notamment dans le cadre de comportement frauduleux. Dans le cadre d’une IA simple, que le CESE définit comme une « IA étroite »[11], celle-ci est programmée humainement pour réaliser des tâches spécifiques selon des méthodes et des critères définis par un agent en charge de cette programmation. L’IA est donc confinée à un rôle prédéterminé avec des paramètres fixes qu’elle ne peut altérer. Dès lors, la personne à qui la responsabilité des actions répréhensibles est imputable est celle qui a programmé l’IA. En effet, quand bien même elle agirait sur les ordres d’une partie tierce utilisatrice finale de l’IA en question, celle-ci doit déclarer aux autorités la volonté de ladite partie d’enfreindre la loi. En revanche, pour ce qui est de l’IA complexe, ou que le CESE définit comme une « IA générale », celle-ci n’est qu’initialement programmée par l’être humain. Celle-ci définira ses actions de sa propre autonomie, et pourra donc altérer les consignes imposées initialement. Isaac Asimov, par rapport aux 3 lois de la robotique qu’il avait inventées, avait relevé le problème dans sa nouvelle « LENNY » : « Puis-je vous faire remarquer […] que c’est là une pratique dangereuse ? Si l’on commence par des robots ignorants tels que Lenny, cela signifiera que l’on ne pourra jamais tabler sur le respect de la Première Loi … exactement comme cela s’est produit dans le cas de Lenny »[12]. Dès lors, à qui est imputable la faute émise par l’IA ? Dans la mesure où la faute est imprévisible, le fabricant, ou plutôt le concepteur, initial ne peut être tenu pour responsable des évolutions de l’IA, en ce sens que celle-ci sont imprévisibles et dépendent des données fournies par la personne utilisatrice. A cette fin, dans le cas présent, on pourrait donc en déduire une responsabilité de l’entreprise utilisatrice. Cependant, dans la mesure où il n’est pas attendu d’une IA qu’elle soit, dans son fonctionnement, dans l’illégalité lorsque celle-ci est mise en fonction, il apparaît difficile de sanctionner un comportement non désiré. La difficulté d’un élément intentionnel L’élément intentionnel est à prendre en compte à deux niveaux : au niveau de l’entreprise mettant en place l’IA, et au niveau de l’IA elle-même. Au niveau de l’entreprise, on peut distinguer deux situations : la première comparable à celle réalisée par Athena Capital Research LLC, soit une programmation volontaire à des fins de manipulations de cours dont le procédé pourrait être transposé dans les atteintes à libre concurrence, et la seconde où les actions frauduleuses n’étaient pas désirées par l’entreprise. Dans le premier cas, l’entreprise a manifesté une volonté d’entorse à la loi, et est donc condamnable pénalement, l’élément intentionnel étant démontrable. En ce qui concerne la seconde situation, on peut observer une différence pour les sanctions en ce qui concerne les distorsions de marché et les abus de marché. Pour les premiers, notamment en ce qui concerne les possibilités d’ententes, il est nécessaire de matérialiser une rencontre des volontés de coopérer. Or, tout l’enjeu d’une entente implicite rationnelle est l’absence de rencontre de volonté, seulement la mise en place d’un comportement rationnel à des fins d’optimisation des revenus. Dès lors, l’entente implicite ne peut être sanctionnée, dans la mesure où l’IA ne permet d’avoir qu’un parallélisme de comportements stratégiques sur la base d’informations disponibles. En ce qui concerne les abus de marché, ceux-ci peuvent faire l’objet d’une procédure pénale, mais aussi d’une procédure administrative. Si la sanction pénale nécessite la présence d’un élément intentionnel, la sanction administrative peut se contenter de relever les effets perturbateurs du fonctionnement normal du marché[13]. Au niveau de l’IA, toute la question repose désormais sur ce qu’est la volonté de réaliser l’action frauduleuse. Tout l’objet de la réflexion du sujet reposera justement sur la possibilité ou non pour une IA de réaliser volontairement une action prohibée et étant connue d’elle comme telle. Cela suppose alors, dans la programmation des IA, d’intégrer en code informatique les législations applicables. Ainsi que nous l’avons vu, les IA génèrent des difficultés pour la mise en œuvre des règles permettant de sanctionner des comportements portant atteinte aux différents marchés économiques. Si actuellement, la présence d’une sanction administrative dès constatation d’effets néfastes sur les marchés peut s’avérer une solution efficace, cette solution nécessite des évolutions allant de concert avec les évolutions technologiques à venir.

How the Movie Industry changed and How Blockchain can resolve the problem?,Written by Creative Rocket Platform," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Creative Rocket Platform Follow Creative Rocket Platform -- Listen Share The fourth industrial revolution has accelerated ICT convergence. The paradigm of media is changing, with the evolution from traditional media centered on devices to intelligent and integrated media. Changes in the media industry (1) Viewers are no longer limited to time of broadcasting to watch (2) The use of smartphone has increased and media contents became personalized as well. (3) Taste for media contents are being differentiated from popular and common ones into personalized ones Viewers(consumers) are get used to purchase contents from various fields including broadcast, music, movies, etc. from digital platform. Backside these systems, however, are problems such as unfair distribution of revenue and copyright infringement between contents creators and distribution platforms. Then what is Blockchain technology and how can it change the media industry? Blockchain refers to a decentralized information sharing(storing) technology that allows you to trust each other without intermediaries when dealing with a large number of unknown parties online using distributed ledger. With Blockchain technology, we expect media industry to be changed as follow: (1) Improve existing unfair revenue structure by eliminating intermediaries (2) Change the copyright payment system(contents registered in the blockchain clearly specifies the copyright holder and settlement can be automatically paid to the copyright holder when the content is sold) (3) Everyone can see the payment history for a particular movie or TV series and see transparently how the payment was distributed among the parties involved. (4) Direct relationship between consumers and artists can facilitate healthy ecosystem. (5) A reliable reputation system can be built. This is because public reputation for a particular image can be accurately recorded in the block and is impossible to be fabricated. Blockchain has the key to resolving the limitation of trust and monopoly. Blockchain technology is being introduced to the entire industry including media. We are looking forward to what solutions blockchain can offer and what the future will be. -- -- Creative Rocket Platform CRP is a decentralized platform to help content creators fund, develop and share their projects while promoting collaboration and community interactions.

Technology Trends in 2019 Predicted By Alibaba DAMO Academy: More cities will be powering an intelligent “city brain”.,Written by Statecraft Tech," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Statecraft Tech Follow Statecraft Tech -- Listen Share 【Published by Ding Bao Xiu (丁宝秀)】 On January 2nd, Damo Academy has released the “Top 10 Trends of Science and Technology” in 2019, covering smart cities, digital identity, autonomous driving, graph neural network systems, AI chips, blockchains, 5G. Alibaba’s Damo Academy has focused people on cutting-edge technologies that truly create value, providing theoretical support and a source of imagination for the technology development of 2019. In 2019, AI remains the hottest topic in the tech world. If 2018 is the year of AI steps out from laboratory and step in​​to our reality “world”, we believe in 2019 is the year of a new starting point for the full cooperation between humans and AI tech. Damo Academy believes that real-time speech generation on mobile devices may not be distinguishable from live voice, and even voice AI will pass the Turing test in some specific conversations. There will be more and more talking facilities in our cities in the future. Damo Academy believes that biometrics will enter a large-scale application phase in 2019. In the past few years, many people have become accustomed to going out without a wallet and cash. In the future, the era of going to the world without an ID card will not be too far away. With the rapid spread of 3D sensors and the integration of multiple biometrics, each device can “see” and “listen” which in other words, they become “smarter”. Biometric and vivo technologies will reshape identity and certification. Digital identity will become the person’s second identity card. In addition, the Damo Court believes that in 2019, 5G will lead to a new application scenario, 5G will greatly enhance mobile bandwidth, provide a peak rate of nearly 100 times that of 4G, and enhance connectivity to 10 billion levels. At the Yunqi Conference (The Computing Conference) in Hangzhou in 2018, the release of Hangzhou City Brain 2.0 made people once again shocked. The ability of the city’s brain has expanded from the transportation field to the fine management of society, including fire protection, urban construction and environment. Damo Academy believes that more and more cities in China will have urban brains. At the same time, real-time urban simulation is possible, urban local intelligence will be upgraded to global intelligence, and more power will be developed in the future for urban brain technology and application research. On the physical city, full-time perception, full-element linkage, and full-cycle iteration will be born. The smart city has greatly promoted the optimization of urban governance. In 2018, auto-driving technology development was like in a roller coaster. From the capital companies to the general trend, the automatic driving winter was once rampant. Damo Academy believes that simply relying on the “cycling intelligence” to innovate the car will not be able to meet the greatest driverless for a long time, but it does not mean that the automatic driving is completely moving into the winter (bear market). The road-to-technical route will speed up the arrival of driverless. In the next 2–3 years, the commercialization of autonomous driving, represented by limited scenes such as logistics and transportation, will usher in new progress. Commercial scenes such as fixed-line bus, unmanned distribution, and park micro-circulation will quickly land. While we are embarrassing new technologies, we need to aware the safety and risk that technologies will bring to us. Therefore, network security will continue to be a hot topic in 2019. The Damo Academy believes that in the next few years, hackers and black market attacks will not stop, but data security protection technology will be launched soon. Governments will tend to introduce more stringent data security policies and regulations, and companies will invest more in personal data privacy protection. Cross-system data tracking and tractability related technologies will be more widely used. Here are the top 10 trends the Academy forecasts for 2019: 1. Cities Get Smarter: Real-Time Urban Simulation Becomes Possible Dynamic and real-time urban infrastructure data, such as traffic, water, electricity and air quality data will be analyzed by large-scale computing platforms. The development of computing power and algorithms will foster the merge of nonstructural information such as video footages with structural information, making real-time modeling of urban simulation possible and holistic, intelligent decisions can be made. More resources will be allocated to technologies powering an intelligent “city brain” and its applications, while a city simulation model reflecting the real-time impulses and movements of a physical city can be built to facilitate the optimization of city governance. More cities in China are expected to have a “city brain” in 2019. 2. Speech AI Applications to Pass the Turing Test With cloud-based speech interaction modules become standardized and affordable, people can “talk” to more and more public facilities as voice becomes an increasingly important interface. In the future, there will be at least one available interface point in our surroundings for voice interactions. As speech intelligence technology advances, real-time text-to-speech on mobile devices would be almost identical to human speech, even passing the Turing test in certain conversations, such as ones using a robotic voice to alert about delivery status. Rules and regulations need to be established to regulate the industry, to avoid misusing the technology in advertisements, harassing phone calls and fraud. 3. Specialized AI Chips on the Rise For AI training in data centers, data movement between computing and memory has become a significant bottleneck. As a result, in addressing the challenge, memory-centric AI chip architecture based on the latest-generation of 3D-stacked memory technology will become mainstream. The demand for data bandwidth in AI chips will further motivate the use of 3D stacked memory, such as HBM (high-bandwidth memory) in AI training chips. In addition, brain-inspired neuromorphic computing chips will gain momentum, while researchers seek killer applications. Specialized AI chips may challenge the dominant position of GPUs for AI training in data centers. AI chips with architecture that truly reflect domain-specific features are expected to be increasingly used in edge computing. 4. Giving Machines ‘Common Sense’ Deep learning technology has matured significantly. GNNs that combine with deep learning can link end-to-end learning and inductive reasoning together, which might be able to address issues, such as relational reasoning and explainability that couldn’t be tackled by deep learning before. Robust GNNs can function as a human brain that consists of neurons (or nerve cells), equipping machines with common sense, comprehension and cognitive capabilities. 5. New Computing Architectures Computing architecture will be restructured to meet the demands for data centers and edge computing. In the future, computing, storage and networks should meet the request of high-throughput computing for AI development, as well as the request for low power in Internet of Things scenarios. The heterogenous computing architecture with FPGA, GPU and ASIC, along with emerging memory devices, are driving the evolution of traditional computing architecture. In the foreseeable future, the fundamental changes to computing architecture, underscored by the transition from CPU-centered general computing to Domain-specific computing driven by applications and technology, will accelerate the arrival of AI and the quantum-computing era. 6. 5G Networks will Enable New Applications The fifth generation of wireless technology (5G) will see a significant increase of wireless bandwidth, enhancing the peak speed of 4G network nearly 100 times. This will speed the development of 4k/8k ultra-high-definition videos and immersive interaction based on AR/VR. With connection capability reaching billions of devices, it will enable thorough integration of communication and connection between machines. Networks will gradually evolve into the cloud or become software-based. Networks could also be segmented into multiple virtual subnets that are independent and parallel, offering dedicated virtual private networks for various applications. Additionally, with features like high reliability, low latency and large capacity, 5G networks will enable the development of new areas, such as vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems and the Industrial Internet. 7. Digital Identity Becomes a Second ID Card The expansion of biometric, anti-spoofing and liveness-detection technologies are reshaping the identify verification space. Biometric technology is becoming critical in people’s daily lives, allowing for a more simple and seamless way to confirm identities and increase trust. 8. More-Prudent Developments in Autonomous Driving Biometric technology is maturing and being applied large scale. With the wide adoption of 3D sensors and integration of multiple models of biometric features, each device will be equipped with machine intelligence to see and hear the world. Biometric and liveness detection/anti-spoofing technology is reshaping people’s identification and verification, which will make your digital identity a sort of second ID card. From phone unlock, door access control to dining at restaurants, checking out at supermarkets, entering train stations, passing airport security check and seeing doctors in hospitals, biometric technology is playing an increasingly important role in making trust simpler and our daily life better. 9. Faster Deployment of Blockchain Applications People are more rational about the prospects of blockchain, which was once much overhyped. The deployment of blockchain applications with sustainable commercial value is expected to speed up. Along with the rapid digitization of various industries, IoT technologies will underpin the trusted mapping from off-chain world into on-chain data, and blockchain will expedite the restructuring and optimization of trusted data flow across participants to boost the efficiency of workflow and coordination. More and more blockchain applications will be seen in our daily life, such as cross-border remittances, supply-chain financing, electronic invoices and tamper-proof judicial records. As the value of “chaining” becomes more recognized, layered architecture and cross-chain protocol will become the focus of technology to scale up blockchain infrastructure. 10. Data-Protection Technologies Will Thrive Governments around the world intend to enact/implement more stringent policies and regulations on data security. Corporates will need to invest more in protecting individual data privacy. Though cyberattacks won’t cease in the next few years, data-protection technologies will boom. Traceability technologies across systems, such as watermark, and data-asset protection technology, including advanced anti-crawlers against strong cyberattacks, will be more broadly adopted. ■ Source: gongxiangcj ■ Note: Please specify the source or references of the article for reproduced. ■ Solemn declaration: We reproduced articles and news for purpose of sharing information.

YKC: 2018 Wrap-up,Written by Jonathan 'Yoni' Frenkel," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Jonathan 'Yoni' Frenkel Follow -- Listen Share Shorter “vacation mode” newsletter this time. If you’re planning on attending CES early next week let me know, I’ll be attending and would love to connect. 2018 was a big year, looking forward to an even bigger year in 2019! If you enjoyed reading this article please subscribe to my newsletter for curated opportunities and upcoming events here. “Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.” -Mark Twain Times Critics’ Top Books of 2018: Just in case you were curious what the all powerful NY Times Book Review cultural critics read and reviewed this year. With the number of voices on the Internet, and how verticals are so niche focused (and predictive analytics keep getting smarter) I don’t believe the NY Times has the cultural authority it enjoyed in the past. I read a lot of books in 2018 (and am taking a hiatus from social in the hopes of reading even more in 2019); below are a few of the books I thoroughly enjoyed and believe you will as well. *I will caveat with this, the one question I get asked frequently is how I read so much. The answer is that I make time for it, I just cut out other activities that are not as important to me. But the real answer is just consistency, everyone can start a habit by reading 10 pages a day. That’s very manageable. For all the books being published most people don’t read, which is why I think a daily reading habit is like having a superpower (I use Audible as well, but the data shows reading is still the most effective way to retain knowledge). ⚪️ 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos by Jordan Peterson: I’m perfectly aware of the controversy around Peterson and how he is persona non grata to many on the left. I honestly don’t get it. Not an easy book to get thru but worth it; the author (along with authors like Ryan Holiday and Sam Harris) is the closest thing we have to a modern day philosopher. His YouTube channel is an accessible way to learn about his philosophies. ⚪️ 21 Lessons for the 21st Century by Yuval Noah Harari: No surprise I would include this book. While Sapiens still stands out as YNH’s best work this a good guide for where we are today (and could be headed in the near future). I also felt that this was the author’s coming out book, where he displayed openly himself (and his political leanings). He’s still one of my favorite authors and I’m curious to see where he goes next. ⚪️ Back to Human: How Great Leaders Create Connection in the Age of Isolation by Dan Schawbel: Another pick that should not be surprising given that the ability to connect with people by understanding their perspective (aka empathy) is at an all time low (particularly because of technology). We need more books like this as I don’t see the current crop of people leading our world showing much empathy these days (except towards their base of supporters). This book should be on the reading list of anyone who manages an organization; whether that’s a startup or a Fortune 500. ⚪️ New Power: How Power Works in Our Hyperconnected World–and How to Make It Work for You by Jeremy Heimans and Henry Timms:Anyone who wants to understand our current policy reality and how we got here needs to read this book. It’s actually shocking how many arm chair political critics refuse to acknowledge some of concepts detailed in this book such as the power of decentralized (#hashtag) movements. Just the chapter on the 2016 Presidential race is worth the price of the book. ⚪️ The Laws of Human Nature by Robert Greene: If Greene’s classic works like the 48 Rules of Power were for aspiring Machiavellian wannabes this work is for those aspiring to learn the two most important skills in 2019; empathy and self-awareness (which go hand in hand). The author is able to pull lessons from history and make them relevant today in a way that presents the full range of human behaviors. The back story about how the author suffered a stroke and was able to utilize lessons (particularly the story of legendary psychiatrist Milton Erickson) from the book in his recovery shows that the proof is in the pudding. ⚪️ ELLIS Accelerator: Deadline January 15. Equity-free program for international startups expanding to the US. They support startups that already have traction in their home market and are ready to expand to the United States. Perks: office space and housing in NYC, mentoring, workshops, access to an exclusive community, and a benefits package worth $350k+. Apply here. ⚪️ Exceed.ai Head of Marketing: This Tel Aviv founded AI powered Sales Development Automation Platform is helping sales and marketing teams scale by automating lead capturing, nurturing, engagement and qualification. As the Head of Marketing, you will be their first full time Marketing hire and will lead all marketing activities such as build the Exceed.ai brand, tell their story globally, drive demand through content, media and other means, produce sales material and shape the strategy and direction of their company. Apply here. ⚪️ FuzeHub Innovation Incentive Prize: FuzeHub will administer a New York State Innovation Incentive Prize Program for Food, Beverage & Agriculture Technologies. There are $90,000 in program funds available — with a $10,000 max award per applicant. The Innovation Incentive Prize Program will solicit proposals that support the development of innovative products and/or solutions that will lead to more efficient operations within small-scale farm businesses as well as food processing/beverage production businesses. There is no deadline to apply, but funding for the Innovation Incentive Prize Program is limited, so get there first! Apply here. ⚪️ UpStart: UpStart is currently seeking bold, talented, risk-taking, and collaborative individuals to join their team of visionaries in the Bay Area, Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver-Boulder, or New York City. Learn more about the Innovation Lead position. Learn more about the Chief Development Officer position. Help them amplify the impact of groundbreaking Jewish ventures. Apply today. ⚪️ Urban Future Prize Competition: Join them in their fight to combat climate change! This year they’re offering two tracks — Smart City and Smart Grid. Through generous support from The New York Community Trust, NYSERDA, and Con Edison, the Urban Future Lab is able to offer two winners each a cash prize of $50,000, admission to the ACRE incubator, and a chance to make it in one of the top startup ecosystems in the world. Applications are open until January 4, 2019. Apply here. First Round State of Startups 2018: The annual survey where hundreds of venture-backed founders speak frankly about what it’s like running a technology startup today. Over four years of State of Startups, the First Round Review (one of the best tech newsletters out there)collected 2,700+ submissions and nearly 150,000 data points, creating the industry’s largest dataset on the founder and startup experience.

Top IT Challenges for Pharmaceutical Companies,"Written by Roy Strunin,Pharmaceutical companies are facing greater complexity, price pressure and increasing security threats. All require innovative technology solutions to help drive operational efficiency, data and system security and regulatory compliance."," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Roy Strunin Follow -- Listen Share What are the top IT challenges and possible solutions for pharmaceutical companies today? 1. Changing Regulatory Requirements Digital health care is driving many innovations across industries, especially pharma. However, companies, industries and regulators are not always in sync when it comes to developing sound compliance protocols. Automation, for example, is revolutionizing the way companies address many processes, including the documentation and reporting required for compliance. Companies need to be responsive to rapidly evolving market demands, while at the same time meeting the changing, different, and detailed regulatory requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, European markets and other regions. However, for pharma companies to rely on automation and other emerging technologies, there needs to be greater confidence in core areas, including: Data are often stored in silos and accessed via different platforms. Companies need to integrate data while maintaining integrity. Low confidence in data accuracy can cast doubt on internal researchers and regulators, prompting the need for better data analytics tools. Automation solutions allow pharma companies to reduce the costs of data management, improve data quality and add operational value. Those improvements allow companies to get treatments to market faster while ensuring no harm to patients. 2. Complex Supply Chains Supply chains are integral to pharma success, whether in pharma R&D or manufacturing. A complex network of suppliers, vendors and partners need to communicate, collaborate and share information in real time. Transparency and speed are critical. That means having the right solutions in place for data sharing, communication, document management and collaboration. In addition, sourcing and validation are vital, however, to keeping illegal, tainted, counterfeit and stolen substances out of the supply chain. The U.S. Congress adopted the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCMA) in 2013 to address these concerns. These traceability requirements for prescription drugs have affected manufacturers, distributors, repackagers and dispensers. These requirements have forced manufacturers to have tools that allow for greater transparency throughout the supply chain. Dispensers, for example, cannot accept product ownership without a full transactional history. Standardization and streamlining efforts have helped the industry, but technical solutions are still necessary to make sure compliance for the entire supply chain. 3. Cybersecurity Intellectual property (IP) is a core asset for pharma companies. Protecting these IP assets is critical and often rely on securing a company’s data. With the growth of cyberattacks, companies need broad and deep protection at every level. Addressing the range of cybersecurity threats — malware, ransomware, phishing and viruses — means equipping companies with multiple defenses. At the network perimeter, next-generation firewalls are needed to monitor potential intrusions and suspicious behavior. Throughout the infrastructure, changes need to be tracked and anomalies alerted to security personnel. At the device level, desktop computers and mobile computers need powerful anti-malware protection that is automatically updated and constantly monitoring. To address their critical IT needs, pharma companies need a proven partner with industry-specific experience.

2018 MOMENTS WE ❤,"Written by Jordan Schenck,DIVERSITY & HARMONY,AMBUSH WITH HUMANITY,PURPOSEFUL GROWTH,COMMERCIAL CREATIVITY"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Jordan Schenck Follow -- Listen Share 2018, what a year indeed. We opened our eyes for the first time as a company to a whole planet actively taking massive strides at being a kinder and more accepting place to live. In effort to capture this magic our office sat down, shaking off the glow of holiday gluttony and that “one” drink on New Years, to reflect on the top moments of 2018 that deeply inspired us. Naturally, we looked inward to our very own values as the guide to our thoughts. We must admit in doing this we all had a “holy shit” moment when we realized what a prolific year it has been for us all. Here is our official 2018 review inspired by our values: We embrace all forms of diversity from ethnicity to experience. The process of building harmony can be messy but the results are powerful and more than worth it. 1.) Hollywood woke TFU to the fact that movie goers are craving stories that reflect global culture and represent difference in an authentic and somewhat epic way. Groundbreaking movies like Black Panther, Crazy Rich Asians and Oceans 8, which earned $700m, $250m and $300m at the box office respectively have finally proven that minority casts and women can deliver blockbuster returns in their own right. 2.) 2018 was the year of women in action. From #MeToo mobilizing deeper impact in every industry to Oprah’s speech at the Golden Globes to the female takeover of the Midterm elections to women driving in Saudi Arabia to the Royal Wedding of Megan and Harry we watched first after first that changed history. 3.) Culture creators used releases as platforms to speak their point-of-view not just sell albums. Meek Mill launched his new album “Championships” yet spent all his airtime talking about criminal justice reform. And the First Step Act was passed (a criminal justice reform bill). We go out of our way to create a safe space for people to be vulnerable, creative and challenging. To be themselves, not who they think they ‘should’ be. 4.) Enough is enough. The students of Parkland became the faces of their generation as they rallied a nation and actively challenged government leaders and the NRA to protect our kids. 5.) We don’t have to think the same to love the same. Obama’s speech at John McCain’s funeral showed us how we don’t always have to see eye-to-eye to love and honor each other as human beings. 6.) Commercial beauty is a cage that must be broken. Korean women and men took a public stand against the extreme cultural beauty standards by starting the “Escape The Corset” movement. Commerce is predicated on growth but not all that grows is good. We pursue growth that is sustainable for people, the planet and profit. 7.) Artist expression is limitless when you are Donald Glover. His release of “This is America” under Childish Gambino proved you can maintain creative integrity in a multitude of verticals. 8.) If we learned anything from the past 5 years…ignoring sexism and racism will completely and totally slaughter your brand. Starbucks swiftly responded to racism by closing over 8,000 of its stores on May 29 to conduct unconscious bias training of its employees. 9.) We didn’t know that butterflies could go through metamorphosis to become even more glorious butterflies until Michelle Obama. Her release of Becoming solidified her role as a cultural leader and not just the forever queen of the White House. We see creativity as a mindset not a discipline. The art is in using it to create real value, with the entire company as our canvas. 10.) One Tweet can say everything. In releasing the Kapernick campaign Nike ran the usual playbook — beautiful film, OOH, etc — but it was the Tweet that gained the most media pick-up and consumer action in both conversation and dollars spent. 11.) Community fueled show development and releases created a flywheel amplification effect for Netflix. From To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before to Bird Box you might as well live in under a rock if you weren’t in on the memes. 12.) In response to Trump’s “shit hole countries” comment Airbnb focused on promoting travel to Haiti, El Salvador and Africa.

How Integration platform is driving the 4th Industrial Revolution in 2019,"No-code development capabilities,Low-code development capabilities,Written by Nabamita De,How Integration platform will be driving the revolution,Platform with No-code/ Low-code capabilities,API based ecosystem"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Nabamita De Follow -- Listen Share The first Industrial revolution paved way for a new energy source — steam, which pushed industries towards mechanization. It helped industries to improve productivity. The Second Industrial revolution introduced electricity and other innovations in infrastructure. It created new industries and opportunities to thrive on mass production lines. When we arrived at the Third revolution during the late twentieth century, information technology was the major change agents towards the automation of production processes. And here we are now, the next big thing in the history of the industrial revolution — The Fourth one. It is getting much attention and hailed as important a milestone as the first one. Let’s have a look at why is that? Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) is all about connectedness and how we can embed the technology into our societies and industries. All emerging technology breakthroughs will speed up the digitization of industries. Cloud technologies and 5G will be the front runners of this. A few examples of emerging fields are Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, The Internet of Things (IoT), where such innovation is happening. 4IR or Industry 4.0 is not about inventing technology for technology’s sake. The diagram below explains how 4IR is giving way to enhance connectedness and productivity and some of the social issues. This is the age of disruptive technology. It is creating a level playing field for businesses with innovative and agile business models. Whether it is an enterprise and small business, constant innovation and integration of the business processes has become evident. With No-code and Low-code development platforms, businesses can develop a software application without the need to write code. These platforms use visual modeling approach with pre-built functional components available in the platform library. The developers can just select the components and add to the workflow in line with the application. This helps developers to achieve the results with greater efficiency. This approach also makes the progress visible to all level of people in the business. Also saves businesses a lot of money as they do not need to maintain the stand-up environment and infrastructure. The platforms pretty much offer all in the package. Let’s take a look at how No-code and Low-code development capabilities work; No-code development capabilities provide business users to solve basic functional problems between the departments with simple solutions. These platforms will be more suitable to the SMBs to solve their integration challenges without hiring a professional developer as there is no need to write a code to implement such applications. Low-code capabilities cater to Enterprises that have technology governance requirements. It uses a more synchronized approach with scalable architectures and flexibility in terms of on-prem or cloud implementation. Low-code platforms also extend the capabilities with the use of open APIs. It supports complex integrations using comprehensive components in the platform library and the ability to incorporate all the innovative next-generation technologies and third-party services available via open source. This platform can create sophisticated applications for enterprises that encompasses various departments and domains. It offers better control to the developers for quality testing and performance tools which results in high productivity and speedy deployment. With the choices and capabilities, the integration platform offers, there is no denying the power of APIs that helps these integrations possible. As businesses grow bigger, requirements also grow wider. Enterprises need applications to work across departments and domains. They need to incorporate next-gen technologies to increase productivity. Then there is regulatory compliance and technology governance. Also, there are challenges of modernizing the legacy systems to co-exist with Cloud infrastructure. APIs act as an intermediary between on-prem and cloud, so all the other applications remain neutral to the platform they are installed on and maintain access to the data and other services as they move to the cloud. Integration Platforms and APIs work hand in hand to help businesses integrate applications and manage data with faster deployment and higher efficiency. It saves the organization time, money, and needless to say, the errors generating from the complex coding. These platforms can drive the revolution by speeding up productivity to many folds.

Quickfire — Q/A — Advice to those Entering the Tech/ Digital Marketing Space,Written by Melissa A," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Melissa A Follow -- Listen Share Late last year I was approached to participate in a survey that would be shared with College Students that had an interest in pursuing a career in Digital Marketing or Technology. Here is the transcript: 1. What advice would you give to a student that is looking to venture into this field? I would advise to focus on one aspect of digital marketing per say and become an expert at it; however, I would highly recommend that you do not limit yourself to one aspect of Digital Marketing. You should be aware and knowledgeable of all aspects of what Digital Market offers to its audience. If you are a graphic designer; learn Photoshop, InDesign, but also study UX, web development, Marketing/Social Media Strategies. The more you understand of Digital Marketing conceptually and the various facets/marketing vehicles it offers and how they work; the more marketable you become as a Potential Hire. Furthermore, by learning all aspects of this field, it can help assist your creativity and/or make your Marketing strategies more effective. Keep Learning. There are several online tools and courses available for anyone to continue their education and practice. A lot of resources are free and there are several Digital Marketing Experts who have insightful online blogs, courses, Twitter Chats, etc. that one can take advantage of. The Tech and Digital Marketing field is constantly changing; so staying connected, learning and practicing is highly recommended. Other factors to consider: 2. When reviewing applications and potential candidates to work with, what is something that stands out to you? I think someone who is confident but one that is willing to learn and that is a good team player. In our industry, a Designer, Video Producer, Web Developer, Social Media Strategist is one member of the team. Communication skills and willing to work with others is key. Also, having a good understanding of UX and the importance of establishing goals, objectives and ways to measure success for any design, strategy, tool is also important. We want someone who isn’t just looking to create something; but someone who can understand an objective, create with a purpose and track its success. Work should be relevant to the client’s objectives. 3. What are the creative steps you take when working with a new client? It depends on the project/Digital Marketing Vehicle we are producing, but typically we follow this workflow: These were my quick fire answers. I am always interested in feedback. I personally have been in the tech field for over a decade working as a Project/Program Manager. I would love to hear from you. -- -- #TechieByDesign,Web/IT Program Manager-Runner by day, RoadRunner 4 Life, UTSA Alumn 🤙🏽 #BIRDSUP- SPURS🏀TEXANS 🏈#girlgotsportsskills #MusicLover #musicallday Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*kNHrqHUUkPjVBE3X.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*d876s9dfvdAxSwRTq7cgTA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:569/1*-F2emgQghQI6BPp41Gr5eg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/0*kNHrqHUUkPjVBE3X.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*eoXRQj_nekM-wH7xzKiiTQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*kNHrqHUUkPjVBE3X.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*39a-xFKJL4C_2qnEFih9ng.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*kNHrqHUUkPjVBE3X.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*yuVzMhCJyDENbyhwAsrkwA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*kNHrqHUUkPjVBE3X.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*RzPeFRR8I17_BxHMa9hlaw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*kNHrqHUUkPjVBE3X.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/0*PQUdHX2K_2oVR4d9.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9BKCYE5U6gCFzALTs4pDXA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/0*-UfU52-yX8aq7Kyz.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg']",3-Jan-19,https://medium.com/?source=post_page-----3296a533e64--------------------------------,10,3 min read
阿里巴巴達摩院發布2019科技趨勢： 將有更多地方運用“城市大腦”成為智能城市,Written by Statecraft Tech, Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Statecraft Tech Follow Statecraft Tech -- Share 摘要 | 1月2日，阿里巴巴達摩院發布了“2019十大科技趨勢”，涵蓋了智能城市、數字身份、自動駕駛、圖神經網絡系統、AI芯片、區塊鏈、5G等領域。 【文章來源：共享財經／作者：共享財經、中國新聞網】 1月2日，阿里巴巴達摩院發布了“2019十大科技趨勢”，涵蓋了智能城市、數字身份、自動駕駛、圖神經網絡系統、AI芯片、區塊鏈、5G等領域。在經濟下行壓力增大的大環境下，阿里巴巴達摩院讓人們聚焦到真正創造價值的前沿技術，為2019年的發展提供理論支撐和想像力源泉。 2019年，AI依然將是科技界最熱的方向。如果說2018年AI從實驗室走入了現實，那麼，2019年將開啟人類和AI全面合作的新起點。達摩院認為，移動設備上的實時語音生成與真人語音可能將無法區分，甚至語音AI在一些特定對話中將會通過圖靈測試。在城市裡，會說話的公共設施將會越來越多。 AI技術雖然發展最熱，但比它更快進入成熟階段的是生物識別技術。達摩院認為，2019年，生物識別技術將進入大規模應用階段。過去幾年，很多人開始習慣出門不帶錢包，不帶現金，而未來，不帶身份證走遍天下的時代也將不會太遙遠。隨著3D傳感器的快速普及、多種生物特徵的融合，每個設備都能更聰明地“看”和“聽”。生物識別和活體技術將重塑身份識別和認證，數字身份將成為人的第二張身份證。 在很多人關心的5G領域，達摩院認為，5G網絡的連接能力將增強至百億級，帶來海量的機器類通信及連接的深度融合。隨著5G時代的來臨，網絡將向雲化、軟件化演進，也將會催生全新應用場景，例如車路協同、工業互聯網等領域將獲得全新的技術賦能。 2018年杭州雲棲大會上，杭州城市大腦2.0的發布讓人們再次震驚，城市大腦的能力從交通領域延展至包括在消防、城建、環境在內的社會精細化管理。達摩院認為，中國將會有越來越多城市擁有城市大腦。同時，城市實時仿真成為可能，城市局部智能將升級為全局智能，未來會出現更多的力量進行城市大腦技術和應用的研發，實體城市之上將誕生全時空感知、全要素聯動、全週期迭代的智能城市，大大推動城市治理水平優化提升。 2018年，曾經炙手可熱的自動駕駛經歷冰火兩重天，從資本企業一擁而上再到普遍看衰，自動駕駛寒冬論一度甚囂塵上。達摩院認為，單純依靠“單車智能”的方式革新汽車，確實在很長一段時間內將無法實現終極的無人駕駛，但並不意味著自動駕駛完全進入寒冬。車路協同技術路線，會加快無人駕駛的到來。在未來2–3年內，以物流、運輸等限定場景為代表的自動駕駛商業化應用會迎來新的進展，例如固定線路公交、無人配送、園區微循環等商用場景將快速落地。 新技術令人憧憬，但也給人們帶來安全和風險的擔憂。因此，網路安全將在2019年繼續成為科技領域的熱點。達摩院認為，未來幾年，黑客、黑產攻擊不會停止，但數據安全保護技術將加碼推出。各國政府都會趨向於推出更加嚴厲的數據安全政策法規，企業將在個人數據隱私保護上投入更多力量。跨系統的數據追踪溯源相關的技術將得到更加廣泛應用。 附：達摩院2019十大科技趨勢： 趨勢1：城市實時仿真成為可能，智能城市誕生 城市公共基礎設施的感知數據與城市實時脈動數據流將匯聚到大計算平台上，算力與算法發展將推動視頻等非結構化信息與其他結構化信息實時融合，城市實時仿真成為可能，城市局部智能將升級為全局智能，未來會出現更多的力量進行城市大腦技術和應用的研發，實體城市之上將誕生全時空感知、全要素聯動、全週期迭代的智能城市，大大推動城市治理水平優化提升。 趨勢2：語音AI在特定領域通過圖靈測試 隨著端雲一體語音交互模組的標準化、低成本化，會說話的公共設施會越來越多，未來每一個空間都至少會有一個可以進行語音交互的觸點。隨著智能語音技術的提升，移動設備上的實時語音生成與真人語音可能將無法區分，甚至在一些特定對話中通過圖靈測試。針對這一領域的規則甚至法律會逐步建立，引導行業走向規範化。 趨勢3：AI專用芯片將挑戰GPU的絕對統治地位 當下數據中心的AI訓練場景下，計算和存儲之間數據搬移已成為瓶頸，新一代的基於3D堆疊存儲技術的AI芯片架構已經成為趨勢。 AI芯片中數據帶寬的需求會進一步推動3D堆疊存儲芯片在AI訓練芯片中的普遍應用。而類腦計算芯片也會在尋找更合適的應用中進一步推動其發展。在數據中心的訓練場景，AI專用芯片將挑戰GPU的絕對統治地位。真正能充分體現Domain Specific的AI芯片架構還是會更多地體現在諸多邊緣場景。 趨勢4：超大規模圖神經網絡系統將賦予機器常識 單純的深度學習已經成熟，而結合了深度學習的圖神經網絡將端到端學習與歸納推理相結合，有望解決深度學習無法處理的關係推理、可解釋性等一系列問題。強大的圖神經網絡將會類似於由神經元等節點所形成網絡的人的大腦，機器有望成為具備常識，具有理解、認知能力的AI。 趨勢5：計算體系結構將被重構 無論是數據中心或者邊緣計算場景，計算體係將被重構。未來的計算、存儲、網絡不僅要滿足人工智能對高通量計算力的需求，也要滿足物聯網場景對低功耗的需求。基於FPGA、GPU、ASIC等計算芯片的異構計算架構，以及新型存儲器件的出現，已經為傳統計算架構的演進拉開了序幕。從過去以CPU為核心的通用計算而走向由應用驅動(Application-driven) 和技術驅動(Technology-driven)所帶來的Domain-specific 體系結構的顛覆性改變，將加速人工智能甚至是量子計算黃金時代的到來。 趨勢6：5G網絡催生全新應用場景 第五代移動通信技術將使移動帶寬大幅度增強，提供近百倍於4G的峰值速率，促進基於4K/8K超高清視頻、AR/VR等沉浸式交互模式的逐步成熟。連接能力將增強至百億級，帶來海量的機器類通信及連接的深度融合。網路向雲化、軟件化演進，網絡可切片成多個相互獨立、平行的虛擬子網絡，為不同應用提供虛擬專屬網絡，加上高可靠、低時延、大容量的網路能力，將使車路協同、工業互聯網等領域獲得全新的技術賦能。 趨勢7：數字身份將成為第二張身份證 生物識別技術正逐漸成熟並進入大規模應用階段。隨著3D傳感器的快速普及、多種生物特徵的融合，每個設備都能更聰明地“看”和“聽”。生物識別和活體技術也將重塑身份識別和認證，數字身份將成為人的第二張身份證。從手機解鎖、小區門禁到餐廳吃飯、超市收銀，再到高鐵進站、機場安檢以及醫院看病，靠臉走遍天下的時代正在加速到來。 趨勢8：自動駕駛進入冷靜發展期 單純依靠“單車智能”的方式革新汽車，在很長一段時間內無法實現終極的無人駕駛，但並不意味著自動駕駛完全進入寒冬。車路協同技術路線，會加快無人駕駛的到來。在未來2–3年內，以物流、運輸等限定場景為代表的自動駕駛商業化應用會迎來新的進展，例如固定線路公交、無人配送、園區微循環等商用場景將快速落地。 趨勢9：區塊鏈回歸理性，商業化應用加速 在各行業數字化的進程中，物聯網技術將支撐鏈下世界和鏈上數據的可信映射，區塊鏈技術將促進可信數據在流轉路徑上的重組和優化，從而提高流轉和協同的效率。在跨境匯款，供應鏈金融，電子票據和司法存證等眾多場景中，區塊鏈將開始融入我們的日常生活。隨著“鏈接”價值的體現，分層架構和跨鏈互聯將成為區塊鏈規模化的技術基礎。區塊鏈領域將從過度狂熱和過度悲觀回歸理性，商業化應用有望加速落地。 趨勢10：數據安全保護技術加速湧現 各國政府都會趨向於推出更加嚴厲的數據安全政策法規，企業將在個人數據隱私保護上投入更多力量。未來幾年，黑客、黑產攻擊不會停止，但數據安全保護技術將加碼推出。跨系統的數據追踪溯源相關的技術，比如水印技術，數據資產保護的技術以及面向強對抗的高級反爬蟲技術等將得到更加廣泛應用。 ■ 資料來源：​共享財經 ■ 文章轉載請註明出處 ■

3 Questions From Amazon Alexa Smart Home Pop-Up Store,Written by Shelby," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Shelby Follow -- Listen Share The other day I was casually walking down Yonge Street when I suddenly got stopped by a creative and super excited Amazon employee who wanted me to experience the Amazon Alexa Smart Home Pop-up Shop. I’m interested in technology so I decided to experience Amazon Echo’s lineup of Alexa-powered devices. When I entered the Pop-up Shop, I was greeted by friendly Amazon staff who offered me coffee as I patiently waited for a guide to take a group through a tour of a home fully equipped with Amazon Echo. Amazon Echo is a hands-free speaker you control with your voice. Echo connects to the Alexa Voice Service to play music, ask questions, make calls, send and receive messages, provide information, news, sports scores, weather, and more — instantly Once the guide arrived we walked along a laneway and reached the front door of the smart home. There we were greeted with some interesting technology. Alexa Smart Lock This technology is the answer for anyone who ransacks their pocket or purse in desperation to find their keys. With the Alexa Smart Lock, you don’t need a physical key! You can easily unlock a door with your voice and enter a code on your device. Alexa Ring Smart Doorbell No solicitation sign here! The Alexa Ring Smart Doorbell is equipped with a camera and microphone that allows you to view who is knocking on your door, without leaving the comfort of your couch. With your smartphone, you can access the doorbell even if you’re on the other side of the world! Next, when we entered the home, the guide announced to Alexa that he was home. Without a question or a doubt, Alexa (using SmartThings) followed his command and immediately turned on the lights. In less than a minute our guide also dimmed the lights and transitioned them to red, green, yellow and blue. As I was mesmerized by the colorful lights, he proceeded to direct Alexa with simple spoken commands to do the following: · Adjust the thermostat to ensure the room temperature was comfortable (ecobee thermostat) · Start and play a movie · Lower the window shades · Start to clean the floors with the help of an automatic Roomba Vacuum cleaner · Play, stop and skip music by using Amazon’s Prime Music streaming service After being fully immersed in the living room we made our way to the kitchen and was introduced to the Samsung Smart Home Fridge, a stainless steel beast that displayed everything inside on a bright screen along the right-hand panel. Without exerting energy, you can view exactly what the beast had to offer without opening its door! Although if you want a sandwich you’d need to physically open the fridge door to access the foods items and make it yourself. If you’re missing an item, don’t sweat because Alexa can help create a personalized grocery list. For people who desperately try to avoid the kitchen, don’t fret because Amazon Echo is here to save your day! With a quick Alexa command you can, automatically turn on your kettle (with the help of a Samsung Smart plug), preheat your oven, and ensure your dishes in your dishwasher are clean or dirty. All you need is your voice and a mobile device. When new technology innovations are introduced to the market they receive traction from enthusiastic techies that want the latest gadgets. My experience at the Amazon Echo Alexa Smart Home Pop-up Shop was positive as it gave me an opportunity to really understand how technology can be integrated into my daily life and home. However, in making my home SMART with Amazon Echo, I think need to ask “Alexa” a couple of questions. 1. Is having a SMART home a novelty or a necessity? 2. What does Amazon do with my data? 3. Do I want to share my life with Amazon- Alexa 24 hours a day? Will you be making your home SMART with Amazon Echo? -- -- Strategic Partnerships, Business Development, &Digital Strategy.

Why Your Business Needs 24/7 Support,Written by Roy Strunin," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Roy Strunin Follow DataDrivenInvestor -- Listen Share What happens when your company’s network, phone system, or technologies break on the weekend or the night before a big deadline? For many businesses, the answer is nothing. That’s because their IT service provider or staff leave at the end of the day. That’s not the way businesses operate. You need reliable, fast, and responsive support when a crisis arises. Whether it’s a software issue, a technical problem or a network connection malfunction, you need answers fast. If your business, employees or customers live and work across the country or across the globe, you need support at all hours to address issues large and small. Benefits of 24/7/365 Managed Network Support You need 24/7/365 support for your company that’s part of a fabric of protections and safeguards for your systems, networks, users, and devices. There’s no substitute for having a managed IT services partner that can give your company these benefits: With 24/7/365 support, your users know they have a trusted and reliable option for solving technical issues. Cost Savings With 24/7/365 Support What is the organizational impact of partnering with a managed IT services provider offering 24/7/365 support? Working with a partner who has the resources to offer comprehensive, continual support, your organization will have a cost-effective option for problem-solving your technology. Using a partner frees you from the burdens of hiring, training and retaining personnel to staff and support these functions. When your help desk is combined with a proactive monitoring solution, your savings will multiply. Specialized tools that monitor network performance allow for real-time network decisions that optimize performance. Monitoring also provides security for your network, identifying patterns or behaviors that could indicate a cyberattack. Solving those problems head-on keeps data, systems, and users protected.

The Main Factors in Growing a Successful Community,"Social Influence (real and virtual),Ambition,Responsibility,Energy and Drive,Written by Aidan Reid,So…where do you start?"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Aidan Reid Follow -- Listen Share In the previous post we discussed the four keys to leveraging digital maps to build a community. For this post, we will share how you can form and begin to grow your own committed and engaging group. First things first, there should be a strong underlying reason why a community would form. It must connect with hearts and minds, inspiring and impassioning others to join. It could be to share in a love of sustainable living, tackling the global problem of plastic waste, fascinating wreck sites for intrepid explorers, or even something as simple as finding the best swimming spots. Many of the most successful communities we’ve spoken with in recent months share common themes. Communities are inherently social, often making a bridge between the digital and real world. For example, Kokoza engage their members annually through workshops which strengthen community bonds both locally and nationally. Similarly, regular group calls, forums, meetings and conferences (TEDx, ImpactHub) can foster a sense of community becoming a breeding ground for networking opportunities. It is a bigger investment for members to take the time to meet in person but the rewards for doing so can be a deeper connection with the mission and a stronger sense of community. Every community goal starts with a ‘why’. How to get there is the challenging part and requires dedicated effort from the community leader and involves cycled feedback. WC Kompas is a community searching for solutions for patients with IBD. They share with their members the important steps being taken to spread awareness of the disease. Through their crowdsourcing map they inform and educate members about the medical breakthroughs and partnerships to promote their cause. Your community doesn’t need to change the world, but by having clearly defined goals you and your group can tweak your approach accordingly. Without structure, a group is unlikely to thrive especially as the community numbers grow or the mission objective changes. Leaders of the mission are either appointed or in many cases are the source of inspiration for the group. They could be ambassadors(recruited for PR), community architects (streamlining UX) or simply someone who has a deeply held passion for the cause. ‘Hands-on’ or ‘hands-off’, there should be at least be someone that the group can revert to to ensure their voice is heard and acted upon. Successful communities take time to develop — often years. With the advent of social media, it’s never been easier to create a group/page around a theme. But with ease comes attrition, and Facebook and other channels have become a graveyard for many digital communities. The projects which perform best are those with a long term-vision, embracing the community (online and offline) and driven by passionate individuals. For example, German artist Gunter Demnig created the Stolpersteine Project in 2008 — a timeless and valuable contribution to memorialise the Czech victims of the Nazi atrocities. However, passion can only take you so far. It needs to be combined with the right tools, skills and mindset if you want to achieve something that lasts. Every leader needs a tribe. And even tribes need some structure. There are many places you can find community members. Facebook, Quora, Pinterest, Reddit, Instagram are just a few. Typically your passion will have associated hashtags which make it easier to find like-minded people on social channels (e.g. #bookstagrammers, #stampcollecting, #birdwatching, etc.). If you have defined your community group and members, one way to engage them is by creating a Facebook group where they are more likely to receive post notifications. The danger is that updates can be quickly buried in the newsfeed, especially for some of the bigger groups. In terms of structure, the Mapotic platform can be used to form and grow a community. You have the ability to not only curate and highlight pertinent information related to your mission, but the news feed is designed to foster and promote open collaboration and feedback. Not all communities are alike. With deeper customisation and detailed attributes, you can create a map that connects to the group’s unique values. Eliciting feedback (free of constraints) means that community members have a voice and, more importantly, can be heard. Using third-party social channels means that interactions and traffic is driven to that particular corporation. Putting aside behavioural influences and data sensitivities, it may be the case that hosting on your own domain/site is the preferred option. Mapotic enables this with Embed Mapping features ensuring that the member/customer journey is entirely controlled by you without outside interference. Unique branding can be applied to ensure that your community stands out, or a mobile app added to enhance community links. You can create a map for your community. It’s free. It can be used as a tool to reach a wider audience, as well as to engage existing members. Interested in creating your own map? It’s free to do so.

Dear Apple,Written by Catherine Noujaim," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Catherine Noujaim Follow -- Listen Share (And other tech corporations) You want to know why people aren’t buying your new phones? Well, several issues. Your stuff doesn’t work together anymore. Or if it does work together, it does so to the detriment of the customer, of the user. I bought a new desktop last year. It no longer has a disc drive of any kind. I could not upload my music to it off the ipad or iphone, which are both older. When I got the ipad and phone initially, they were newer than my computer, so I couldn’t really synch them either. However, they are apparently synched enough so if I delete pics off the ipad or phone, they get deleted on the computer. Which, ARGH. I keep hesitating to buy a new phone, even though the old one is on its last legs, and now refuses to actually ring. Why? in part, security. In part, I want my music, thank you. I also don’t WANT a huge phone. I have an ipad for that. I have small hands. I know other people who keep hoping you will come out with something smaller. Also, most people are aware we live in a finite world. We want the stuff we buy to last. We want good manufacturing practices. We don’t want kids mining the rare ores for our phones. We want the people making our phones to have protections. To not get cancer. We are tired of a new gizmo every year, and losing more privacy, more security every year with the release of the new devices. You want to increase your sales? talk to real people about what they want. We want a better world, a better environment. We want actual recycling from companies. We want fair wages for the people who dig the ores. We want usability. I want a phone that I can listen to music on, music that I bought copies of. I want to be able to take photos on my phone, and be able to synch completely with newer and older models of desktop, etc. I know, I know, its a pipe dream. But honestly, you guys need to look at the bigger picture, too… -- -- Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*R1wvG89DRWR0gQn_.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/0*R1wvG89DRWR0gQn_.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*yuVzMhCJyDENbyhwAsrkwA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*R1wvG89DRWR0gQn_.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*yuVzMhCJyDENbyhwAsrkwA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*R1wvG89DRWR0gQn_.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*yuVzMhCJyDENbyhwAsrkwA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*R1wvG89DRWR0gQn_.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*yuVzMhCJyDENbyhwAsrkwA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*R1wvG89DRWR0gQn_.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*_wvc1IOHe1qT5s7-hNm2JQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*wzwnJD8UpPtAd2YoIPEiNQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*TcF9rICJPQZsrzNignSvgw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*6QHaAGV4bp_AAGctwP3x5w.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*4X37q9wlsqgHnYLSgmlNaA.png']",3-Jan-19,https://medium.com/?source=post_page-----fa7f5228cead--------------------------------,0,2 min read
Blockchain — The Invisible Technology,"Written by XCEL Corp,What is blockchain technology?,How does blockchain work?,Addressing double-spending,Benefits to businesses — applying blockchain beyond the cryptocurrency"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in XCEL Corp Follow -- Listen Share Researchers and technologists alike are excited about the rise of blockchain technology, which is foretold to be the next colossal innovation that will help companies garner wealth and resources. This, clearly, seems to have caught everyone’s fancy. So, what exactly is it? An append-only ledger, in a blockchain, users can add new information, without editing, erasing or adjusting any previous information. That is why the data is stored in the form of blocks using cryptography that links contents from the newly added block into the one that is already existing before it. The technology is designed in a manner that any change to the contents of a previous block in the chain would invalidate the data in all the blocks after it. Purely driven by consensus, it works on the principle of network and connectivity of a large number of computers thus reducing malicious transactional invasions by an attacker. There are orchestrations and applications of older principal technologies that are combined to create a blockchain. They are the private key cryptography, a ledger and an incentive to service the transaction such as security and record-keeping. Purposefully, possession of a combination of public and private cryptographic keys create a secure digital identity and reference. The amalgamation is seen as a dexterous form of consent and also regarded as a digital signature, which, in turn, provides control of ownership. Since the technology accommodates a large network of validators, this remains one of the blockchain’s most attractive attributes since it amasses large computing power. At the same time, if we’re to distill the usage of the blockchain, the primary benefit of the underlying technology is to address the problem of double-spending. Predominantly used in the creation and maintenance of cryptocurrencies, the blockchain is susceptible to counter issues where there is a risk of a holder sending copies of the same bitcoin into different transactions advancing the notorious double-spending. A block is created with the details about the transaction and is broadcasted to all the nodes each time a new transaction takes place. A reference to the previous block in the chain is carried by every new block with a timestamp, thus establishing a sequence of events. The new block gets linked to the previous block when the authenticity of the transaction is proven. When such a chain of blocks is replicated across the network, all of them are cryptographically secured which makes hacking virtually impossible. Not just to a cryptocurrency like bitcoin, blockchain technology can be applied to any asset that requires storage, distribution, and transaction such as music, property titles, data, insurance and much more. Here are some ways in which blockchain can be applied to businesses And these are only a few… Here are some ways in which blockchain can be applied to businesses• Accounting textbooks to handle the challenges of complex tax codes• Advertising and marketing to dramatically reduce click frauds• In human resources to plan, direct and coordinate recruiting• Cybersecurity to disseminate names, addresses, dates of birth and other associated information And these are only a few… Revolutionizing TechnologyWhile the technology seems to have taken the digital world by storm, it does come with some practical limitations. Institutions where malleability is required or where there is no added advantage of decentralization, the technology clearly cannot be applied. For example, medical records might be complicated with the use of blockchain. Federal regulations do not permit healthcare institutions to publicize medical records. It is only by encrypting information and storing these encryption keys in centralized entities that the technology can be made to work. Additionally, the licensing of this information has to be controlled by a central authority to make sure that records are not hijacked. Changing erroneous information injected into the chain may also be rather impossible. There was no way to secure and validate ownership in a digital asset or verify a transaction in a trustless, public manner prior to the advent of the blockchain. This is the first technology that transfers digital ownership in a decentralized way. Although it might seem that the platforms supporting the blockchain ecosystem are yet to evolve, there certain businesses that will still benefit from its use. Businesses that are transaction-based, the ones that have a history that cannot be manipulated, those that benefit from public scrutiny and finally, a business where such decentralization actually benefits the customer or the end user. ConclusionIt is forecast that the supporting technology around blockchain is all set to evolve and quickly. One of the biggest benefits derived from it would be consumer awareness and the evolution of an equally supportive community. Businesses can truly benefit by incorporating this technology into their services and products and by tapping into the growing community of engineers.

OAuth — Chapter 1-Understanding OAuth,"Written by Rutuja Wanjari,What exactly is OAuth?,OAuth roles,Workflow,Example 1,Example 2"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Rutuja Wanjari Follow -- Listen Share OAuth 2.0 is a protocol that allows a user to grant limited access to their resources on one site, to another site, without having to expose their credentials. To get access to the protected resources OAuth 2.0 uses Access Tokens. An Access Token is a string representing the granted permissions. Access Token Format By default, Auth0 generates Access Tokens, for API Authorization scenarios, in JSON Web Token (JWT) format. JWTs contain three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature: In any OAuth 2.0 flow we can identify the following roles: We want to login into some application say XYZ.This login can be done via third party like Google or Facebook or Twitter. Let’s consider we use gmail. Here OAuth works as, instead of filling the registration details by applicant, gmail can authenticate and fill the details for us. Here the following four entities are involved: All big companies like Facebook, Google, Github,… use this kind of authorization. Like above example you can sign in on medium using your Google account, this means “medium” doesn’t know my password, it receives the allowance from Google where my password (hashed obviously) is saved. This gives a lot of benefits, one of them is; In the near future you won’t have to make several accounts on every website. One website (which you trust most) can be used to login to all other websites. So you’ll only have to remember one password. If we want to fill an application form for a bank account. Here OAuth works as, instead of filling the form by applicant, bank can fill the form using some ID proof or address proof like passport. Here the following four entities are involved: I hope you must have got an idea on what purpose OAuth serves. In the next chapter we will dive into using OAuth in a Flask application.

"What is PLMN, EPLMN, HPLMN, UPLMN, OPLMN, IPLMN ?","UPLMN:,OPLMN:,FPLMN:,IPLMN:,HPLMN:,VPLMN:,EPLMN :,Written by CSPS Protocols"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in CSPS Protocols Follow -- Listen Share This post contains the meaning of different PLMNs in LTE or 3G network. In earlier PLMN Article explains about what is plmn? The PLMN type changes based on user location and behavior about the network. User PLMN. This is the plmn priority set by the user. Operator PLMN. This is the plmn priority set by the mobile operator. This is forbidden plmn. In roaming a mobile network try to attach from a PLMN. During attach and location update is done with the home network HLR. If subscriber is allowed to roam then, HLR sends the subscriber data. If a subscriber is not allowed to roam, HLR returns roaming not allowed error. In error case roaming plmn is put the forbidden list and FPLMN. Now next time phone does not try with FPLMN. One a phone is restarted then list is cleared. It is Interrogating PLMN. It refers to the MCC and MNC where GMSC and Camel node is located. For a dialed subscriber , first the call hits to the GMSC . GMSC interrogates with the HLR for further call routing. The PLMN id is derived from the IMSI. This never changes while roaming , if IMSI is not changing, the HPLMN will not change. Visited PLMN. The PLMN id is the for roaming network. Equivalent PLMN. If a subscriber roames in Home PLMN there is no roaming. Subscriber always see the signals of the home mobile network operator. An operator may not have much coverage , so they do collaborations with other mobile operators , where the roaming will not be applied. This is call EPLMN. Subscriber have impression that he is in his home network. E.g The IDEA network in India might not have coverage in some state. There it can use another mobile operator (e.g Airtel).

Will Artificial Intelligence Put an End to Real People?,Written by Elayne Clift," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Elayne Clift Follow -- Listen Share Okay, I confess. Sorry, Siri, but I find you and Alexa creepy. I worry that native intelligence is being replaced by “artificial intelligence,” which strikes me as a modern-day oxymoron, like “virtual reality.” I’m scared about what’s coming as technology takes over our lives. And I’m nearly convinced robots are going to make humans unnecessary if not extinct. Call me crazy, but that’s what they called Jules Verne too. It seems I’m in good company. Some pretty big names in science and technology have also expressed concern about the inherent risks AI could pose. They include the late physicist Stephen Hawking who told the BBC several years ago that, “the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.” Elon Musk, engineer and head of Tesla, has said that autonomous machines could unleash “weapons of terror,” comparing the adoption of AI to “summoning the devil.” And Bill Gates is worried that AI is only viable if we make sure humans remain in control of machines. As one techie posted on Tech Times.com, what happens if Siri decides that she wants to take over the world? He didn’t seem to think that was a real threat, but what if AI becomes so advanced that it decides it wants power of its own? Others worry that if artificially intelligent systems misunderstand a mission they’re given, they could cause more damage than good and end up hurting lots of people. A lot of folks are worried about the implications of AI-controlled weapons. They might be able to help soldiers and civilians in war zones, but they could also cause a global arms race that could end up being disastrous. According to a scientist at the Future of Life Institute, “There is an appreciable probability that the course of human history over the next century will be dramatically affected by how AI is developed. It would be extremely unwise to leave this to chance,” he argues. There are also troubling ways in which AI could infringe upon our personal privacy. Facebook’s recent problems have already demonstrated some of the possibilities, from unwanted intrusion to exposure that leaves us vulnerable. Facebook can already recognize someone by the clothes they wear, the books they read, and the movies they watch. What happens when government agencies have fully developed recognition systems? In one alarming thesis put forward by Nick Bostrom, an Oxford University philosopher, artificial intelligence may prove to be apocalyptic. He thinks AI “could effortlessly enslave or destroy Homo sapiens if they so wished.” No longer the stuff of science fiction, many AI milestones have already been reached even thought experts thought it would take decades to get where we are now in terms of relevant technology. While some scientists think it will take a long time to develop human-level AI or superintelligence, others at a 2015 conference thought it would happen within the next forty years or so. Given AI’s potential to exceed human intelligence, we really don’t know how it will behave. If humans are no longer the smartest beings on earth, how do we get to stay in control? A recent, lengthy article about “Superior Intelligence” in The New Yorker, pointed out that imbuing AI with higher intelligence than humans have risks having robots turn against us. “Intelligence and power seek their own increase,” Tad Friendly posited in his piece. “Once an AI surpasses us, there’s no reason to believe it will feel grateful to us for inventing it, particularly if we haven’t figured out how to imbue it with empathy.” Here’s another interesting thing to contemplate. In 1988, Friendly shares, “roboticist Hans Moravec observed that tasks we find difficult are child’s play for a computer, and vice versa. ‘It is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult-level performance in solving problems on intelligence tests, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility.’” And here’s a scary thought: According to The New Yorker, Vladimir Putin told Russian schoolchildren not long ago that “the future belongs to artificial intelligence. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.” In light of recent interference with western elections, one must wonder what he’s got in the way of AI technology (or whether he has already found a way to infiltrate Donald Trump’s brain and program his mouth.) I realize I may be getting ahead of things and sounding unduly alarmist, but it’s all pretty scary stuff. I hope the day never comes when people younger than I am have to admit that, along with Stephen Hawking et. al., I was not totally out in left field.

Shedding Layers,"Two startup founders are changing how we view outerwear — and entrepreneurship,Written by Alicia Auhagen"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Alicia Auhagen Follow -- Listen Share Michael Markesbery ’15 stares at the cement floor of the glass conference room in his downtown Cincinnati office, right leg crossed over left. A deep sigh escapes his lips and fills the space with deeper silence. One rolling chair away, Rithvik Venna ’15 concentrates his gaze on the frosted table in front of him. The question suspended in the air is one Markesbery “semi-hates.” What does being an entrepreneur mean to you? It’s a question he and fellow OROS co-founder Venna have heard before. Since the launch of their apparel company in 2013 while undergrads, they’ve captured the attention of the business community and consumers. It’s no wonder. They’ve raised $7 million from investors, won Forbes 30 Under 30 in Retail & Ecommerce, and patented NASA-inspired technology. Venna looks up from the table. He shrugs and delivers an unexpected answer. “Being an entrepreneur means nothing, actually.” Read the full story in the fall/winter 2018 edition of Miamian magazine. -- -- I write creative nonfiction & poetry about food, travel, and being human. | Cincinnati, OH Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/2*VOXeSIdf207JH4H3r_FIHA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*Gx_vgQN72Gtb3_7pCkBL_w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/2*VOXeSIdf207JH4H3r_FIHA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*UO1rs7D9i94AjxxTH6eydA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*VOXeSIdf207JH4H3r_FIHA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*LpVhCNPUe14EGeqckvg1bg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*VOXeSIdf207JH4H3r_FIHA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*Kn6cdm2QLz7AXpx9WpKVfA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*VOXeSIdf207JH4H3r_FIHA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*09OyaEbhXaXdnqGuUtruGg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*VOXeSIdf207JH4H3r_FIHA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*Ans6sKAILtR_3JrzUVH-5A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*2s48FXT-YXuen8EdcpUWog.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*7-Vd2V6yvsrRROavIg5RFg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*iQJjezE8PMsrLMJyhgmWDA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*SSldMA8f2cLiwAZDfFFwVA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*v81PL_0CTnry3iWQHBAKpQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*OBfDmjyxB202l8XyjdnNIQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*cwg5xfYhiudrguIdmXuyzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*2hALFP9xspBHwBaJ_zRRsQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*I2ObYjzqveyXzEe9QixMPw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*FCSZoy-APX517P8IPmI6pw.png']",3-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@aliciaauhagen?source=post_page-----c345bc7d2af9--------------------------------,5,1 min read
Changing Healthcare with Informatics,Written by Nabil Adam," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Nabil Adam Follow -- Listen Share Healthcare Informatics has brought around a large amount of change within the Healthcare industry. The creation of new technology continues to impact and reshape the industry while improving the way doctors provide medical care. The benefits from each technological achievement work to bring us into a better future in healthcare, while eliminating systems that clearly do not provide the most accurate information. Healthcare Informatics has taken the place of medical records and different healthcare systems to streamline the industry. Many of the developments are physical changes we can see such as new programs and systems for medical records and patient to physician interactions. Aside from the physical, there are other changes that continue to benefit and make way for the successful future of healthcare informatics. Patients Taking Interest In Their HealthA great improvement that has been seen over the years informatics have been implemented, is the increase of patients taking an interest in their own health. Because patients now have access to their medical records and diagnoses, they’ve been more apt to stay up to date on appointments, which medications they should be taking, as well as their diagnoses and symptoms. This is also true in the fact that through patient portals, patients are able to speak directly to their doctors and nurses when they have any questions, concerns, or need something such as a refill on medication. Knowledge and Communication Has IncreasedThere are so many different specialists in the healthcare industry that most patients are seeing multiple physicians on a yearly basis for different reasons. A huge advancement with healthcare informatics is how connected medical professionals are. Communication and sharing of information among each physician helps to provide patients with the best care possible. Keeping all information in one place that is easily accessible provides the knowledge needed to diagnose and treat patients with less unanswered questions and decreases the possibility for a misdiagnosis. The best outcome from healthcare informatics is the increased level of quality care. Freeing up time from our medical professionals by having new technology and healthcare information systems creates not only quality care, but safer care for patients. With proper diagnosis’ and efficiency from medical staff, insurance companies, hospitals, and patients all save money in the long run. The continued growth of healthcare technology will transform the future of the medical industry.

Keeping up with the speed of business,Written by The Digital Transformation People," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in The Digital Transformation People Follow -- Listen Share As we bid farewell to 2018 and look ahead to the next 12 months, it is no surprise to hear that things will only progress more quickly. Leading enterprise robotic process automation (RPA) software company, UiPath, predicts that “everything will be accelerated in 2019”. The company has newly released its top five predictions from some of its senior leaders. Kulpreet Singh, managing director EMEA, reckons the pace of automation will increase as large-scale RPA implementations advance rapidly in the region. He says they will be “turbo-charged” by the spread of expertise through widely available training programmes, new open marketplaces and the maturation of internal centres-of-excellence. Singh adds that such implementations will progress more quickly in the EMEA region than other parts of the world, especially when it comes to deploying attended software robots in a wide range of settings. UiPath also forecasts that automation will be “democratised” through global vendor education initiatives and that senior executives will back RPA and it will be easier to gain senior executive sponsorship for automation because its benefits have become so obvious. While the predictions have far-reaching effects for workplaces and the world of business, they are both positive and indicative of how technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics are being embedded into workplaces and work practices. There is still a great deal to be done and those leaders that have distanced themselves from digital transformation programmes must roll up their sleeves and get stuck into what needs to be done to advance their organisations into the digital era. Surveys will continue to be published and headlines were written that warn AI and machine learning will mean loss of jobs and bring major changes that may initially alarm people but we also now know that these technologies will create new roles. It will not be plain-sailing though and not every organisation will get it right the first time. A recent online post I read complained about how an airline’s staff stood by while passengers using the self-service struggled to lift heavy bags and sort boarding passes. As you’d expect, the writer was rightly angered by this and it reinforced their view of the pitfalls of self-service. This was not the fault of the self-service system though but a failure of leadership that the staff didn’t have a mindset to help customers. Not only does it scream of poor customer service but also of badly implemented automation. So while the pace of technological development means that things will only get faster, it is down to us as leaders to make sure they also get better. Finally, it remains for me to say thank you to everyone who has read and commented on my blogs during 2018 and to wish you all a very happy Christmas and New Year.

As if to say “Oh, no. Not today, Umair. I defy you!! No more torture at your hands!” (which is how I imagine you too, dear reader, sometimes.) It was time for a new laptop. Cue Jaws music. Not being a geek, events like this fill me with a little dread. What’s a SATA? A terabyte is…bigger than a gigabyte? I need how many cores? You don’t say. I hoped I’d just do what I always do, every few years or so. Try to ignore it all, cruise over to Apple, order the newest laptop, more or less the same as the old one. Phew. Done. Easy. I’d have a few years until my new laptop got angry enough to hit me in the nose. Sweet relief. Now, I do basically three things on my computer. Reading, writing, and music. Lucky for me, weirdly for me, this time, I did a little research. And I discovered that the 2018 Apple laptops have some kind of ruinous audio bug (at least if music involves external stuff, like speakers.) So I figured, hmm, maybe I’ll splurge and get an iMac Pro, like a grown-up. I’ve… -- -- 77 Eudaimonia and Co vampire.

A Top Roboticist Says A.I. Will Not Conquer Humanity,"Cars will drive themselves, robots will clean your toilet—but exponential progress is unlikely,Written by Brian Bergstein"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Brian Bergstein Follow OneZero -- 28 Share If you imagine the technologies that will define daily life in 50 years, it’s tempting to think of Arthur C. Clarke’s dictum that advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. You might envision the world of 2069 bursting with things we would consider fantastical today. The problem with that is, technologies don’t just magically appear. They come from the clever refinement and recombination of previously existing technologies. Even when powerful innovations do arise, it can take decades for them to replace old stuff that works well enough. To wrap my mind around where we’re actually heading, I called Rodney Brooks. Brooks, 64, is both a technological optimist and a realist. He’s the former head of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence lab at MIT and a co-founder of two robotics companies — iRobot, maker of the Roomba floor cleaners, and Rethink Robotics, which until recently made robots that could work closely with people. He also has written extensively about why A.I. is overhyped, and how people misunderstand the uneven pace of technology. -- -- 28 OneZero Journalist in Boston. Editor at large, NEO.LIFE.

A Complete React Boilerplate Tutorial — From Zero to Hero,"Written by Leonardo Maldonado,Getting started,Webpack,Babel,ESLint,Prettier,React,Redux,React Router,Styled Components,Jest & React Testing Library"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Leonardo Maldonado Follow We’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/news -- 24 Listen Share When we’re starting learn React, to make our projects we need to make a boilerplate from scratch or use some provided by the community. Almost all the times it’s the create-react-app that we use to create an app with no build configuration. Or we just make our own simple boilerplate from scratch. From this, it comes to mind: why not make a boilerplate with all dependencies that I always use and leave it ready? The community also thought that way, so now we have several community-created boilerplates. Some are more complex than others, but they always have the same goal of saving the maximum amount of time. This article will teach you how you can build your own boilerplate from scratch with the main dependencies used in the React community today. We’re gonna use some of the moderns features most common these days and from there you can customize it any way you want. The boilerplate created by this article will be available here! First of all, we’re going to create a folder to start our boilerplate. You can name it whatever you want, I’m gonna name mine react-bolt. Open your terminal, and create it like this: Now, go to your created folder, and type the following command: NPM will create a package.json file for you, and all the dependencies that you installed and your commands will be there. Now, we’re going to create the basic folder structure for our boilerplate. It’s gonna be like this for now: Webpack is the most famous module-bundler for JavaScript applications nowadays. Basically, it bundles all your code and generates one or more bundles. You can learn more about it here. In this boilerplate we’re going to use it, so install all these dependencies: Now in our config folder, we’re going to create another folder called webpack, then inside that webpack folder create 5 files. Create a file called paths.js. Inside that file is going to be the target directory for all your output files. Inside it, put all this code: Now, create another file called rules.js, and put the following code there: After that, we’re going to create 3 more files: webpack.common.babel.js webpack.dev.babel.js webpack.prod.babel.js Basically, in our webpack.common.babel.js file, we’ve set up our entry and output configuration and included as well any plugins that are required. In the webpack.dev.babel.js file, we’ve set the mode to development. And in our webpack.prod.babel.js file, we’ve set the mode to production. After that, in our root folder, we’re going to create the last webpack file called webpack.config.js and put in the following code: Our webpack config is ready, so now we’re going to work on other parts of the boilerplate with Babel, ESLint, Prettier, etc. I think that almost everyone who works with React has probably heard about Babel and how this simple transpiler helps our lives. If you don’t know what it is, Babel it’s basically a transpiler that converts your JavaScript code into plain old ES5 JavaScript that can run in any browser. We’re going to use a bunch of Babel plugins, so in our root folder, install: After this, we’re gonna create a file in our root folder called .babelrc and inside that file, we’re going to put the following code: Now our project is compiled by Babel, and we can use the next-generation JavaScript syntax without any problems. The most used tool for linting projects nowadays is ESLint. It is really helpful to find certain classes of bugs, such as those related to variable scope, assignment to undeclared variables, and so on. First, install the following dependencies: Then, in our root folder, create a file called .eslintrc and put the following code there: Prettier is basically a code formatter. It parses your code and re-prints it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary. You just need to install it: And in our root folder, create a file called .prettierrc and put the following code there: React is an open-source JavaScript application library to build user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and has a huge community behind it. If you are reading this article, I assume that you already know about React, but if you want to learn more about it, you can read up here. We’re going to install the following dependencies: And inside our src folder, we’re going to create a simple HTML file index.html and put in the following code: After that, we’re going to create a simple React project. Inside our src folder, create a index.js file like this: Inside our src folder we’re going to have the following structure: Create a file called App.js inside the components folder, and put in the following code: Redux makes it easy to manage the state of your application. Another way of looking at this is that it helps you manage the data you display and how you respond to user actions. These days a lot of people prefer other options like MobX or just the setState itself, but I’m gonna stick with Redux for this boilerplate. First, we’re going to install some dependencies: Then, we’re going to create our Redux store, and put some state there. In our store folder, create an index.js file and put that following code there: Now, inside our reducers folder create an index.js and put the following code: Last, we’re gonna to our index.js in our src folder, and wrap the code with the <Provider /> and pass our store as props to make it available to our application. It’s going to be like this: All done. Our Redux store is configured and ready to go. React Router is the standard routing library for React. Basically, it keeps your UI in sync with the URL. We’re gonna use it in our boilerplate, so install it: After that, go to our index.js in our src folder and wrap all the code there with the <BrowserRouter>. Our index.js in our src folder it’s going to end up like this: Styled Components makes CSS easy for everyone, as it helps you organize your React project. Its objective is to write more small and reusable components. We’re gonna use it, and if you want to learn more about it, read up here. First, install it: Then, in our App.js file inside our components folder, we’re going to create a simple title using Styled Components. Our title is going to be like this: And inside our file, we need to import styled components, so our file is going to end up like this: Jest is an open-source JavaScript testing library from Facebook. It makes it easy to test your application, and gives us a lot of information about what is giving the right output and what’s not. React Testing Library is a very light-weight solution for testing React components. Basically, this library is a replacement for Enzyme. Every application needs some kind of tests. I’m not gonna write tests in this article but I’m gonna show you how you can configure these tools to start testing your applications. First, we’re gonna install both: After that, go to our package.json and put the following after all: Then, go to our config folder, and inside it created another folder called tests and inside that folder, create 2 files. First, create a file called jest.config.js and put in the following code: Then, create a file called rtl.setup.js and put in the following code: All done. Our boilerplate is ready to go and you can use it now. Now go to our file package.json and put in the following code: Now, if you run the command npm start and go to localhost:8080, we should see our application working fine! If you want to see my final code, the boilerplate created by this article is available here! I have some ideas for some features that I’d love to include in the boilerplate, so please feel free to contribute! 🐦 Follow me on Twitter! ⭐ Follow me on GitHub! I’m looking for a remote opportunity, so if have any I’d love to hear about it, so please contact me! -- -- 24 We’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/news Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*Rxp1F2ChMfKqcoUk5z-KSQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*MotlWcSa2n6FrOx3ul89kw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:3870/1*IRVIWE6HiS8wQstgybKwvw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*Rxp1F2ChMfKqcoUk5z-KSQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*MotlWcSa2n6FrOx3ul89kw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*nt8jD9-bjQvWWjMkf-gspw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Rxp1F2ChMfKqcoUk5z-KSQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*QZbMZH9PNKkEujjUaGOWKQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*G6YHu4RZdCguAYgIl79NsA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*0yse40ucjmpdlaBqlY0fTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*QFSavJBxHK-ISRj5', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*QFl5u-rZN3dou7XDNNwuBA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Rxp1F2ChMfKqcoUk5z-KSQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*rgxBZQVyrT1iiLIA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*1qm6A8AoOQ_nsiT-', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*sUMqFUCDQecggwfr87SKSg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*B2BysKFq15whi0Sf', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zPtGTCNOwu1p3kzn_sZFVQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*kQIvhDkl0ixPpv4z', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*ERYx0IB1pN-5ZX98cKAoUw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*gzCeWxDtGmD23QR5', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*di4WDrnS1F6_p9GWnxvPmg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PzJLbFrFtNkqPsxielO8zA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/0*r4yjMpEmqzHCUvWC.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*bv2KUVNLi2sFNjBTdoBmWw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/0*zsngbTOmFCy6sUCx.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*YmLMV1ml5HcI1zfNScs83Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*jjychJZ86TA3eCPn9M_waA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*Vz4ImhG_syOrDPSDnV9CIg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*JUG2egwgSo0fGzFA', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*TQlEMeYwwWc38Wqm7EfCTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*0-N4JrXpZG1KJfIrAutd3A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wfjWtGeX6Pevw4YgL7RraQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*cCQCDUmfPx-3hOZf7MYusg.png']",4-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@leonardomso?source=post_page-----20023e086c4a--------------------------------,2322,7 min read
"How to Easily Build Desktop Apps with HTML, CSS and Javascript","package.json,src/index.js,Main process and renderer process,src/index.html,Code in index.js explained,Written by Aditya Sridhar,Electron,Electron Forge,Pre-requisites,Let’s get started with the application,Understanding the Existing Folder Structure and Code,Let’s create a Temperature Converter Desktop Application,Running the application,Packaging the application,Creating a make File,Code,Congrats 😄,About the author"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Aditya Sridhar Follow We’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/news -- 30 Listen Share Can HTML, CSS and Javascript really be used to build Desktop Applications? The answer is yes. 😄 In this Article we will be focussing mainly on how Electron can be used to create desktop applications with Web Technologies like HTML, CSS and Javascript. Electron can be used to build Desktop Apps with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Also these apps work for multiple platforms like Windows, Mac, Linux and so on. Electron combines Chromium and NodeJS into a single runtime. This enables us to run the HTML, CSS and Javascript code as a desktop application. If Electron is used directly, then some manual setup is needed before building your application. Also if you want to use Angular, React, Vue or any other framework or library, you will need to manually configure for that. Electron Forge makes the above things much easier. It provides template applications with Angular, React, Vue and other frameworks which avoids the extra manual setups. Also it provides an easy way to build and package the application. It also provides many other features which can be found in their documenation. Ensure you have NodeJS installed. It can be installed from here. Install Electron Forge globally using the following command: Use the following command to create your application: simple-desktop-app-electronjs is the name of the application. The above command will take some time to run. Once it finishes running, start the application using the following commands: This should open up a window like the one shown below: The application has a particular folder structure. Here I will be mentioning some of the important things in this folder structure. It has information about the application you are creating, all the dependencies needed for the app, and some scripts. Some of the scripts are already pre configured, and you can add new scripts as well. The config.forge path has all the configurations which are specific to ElectronJS. For example make-targets is used to specify the target make files for various platforms like Windows, Mac or Linux. Also package.json has ""main"": ""src/index.js"" which indicates that src/index.js is the starting point of the application According to package.json, index.js is the main script. The process which runs the main script is known as the main process. So the main process runs the index.js script. The main process is used to display GUI elements. It does this by creating web pages. Each web page created runs in a process called the renderer process. The purpose of the main process is to create web pages using a BrowserWindow Instance. The BrowserWindow Instance uses a renderer process to run each web page. Each app can have only one main process but can have many renderer processes. It is possible to communicate between the main and the renderer process as well. This, however, will not be covered in this article. abcd.html is shown as a second webpage in the above architecture. But in our code we won’t be having a second web page. index.js loads the index.html file into a new BrowerWindow Instance. What this basically means is that index.js creates a new GUI Window, and loads it with index.html web page. The index.html web page runs in its own renderer process. Most of the code created in index.js has good comments explaining what it does. Here I will mention a few key points to note in index.js: The above code snippet basically creates a BrowserWindow Instance and loads index.html into the BrowserWindow. You will see app used often in the code. For example take the below code snippet: app is used to control the application’s event life cycle. The above code snippet says that when the application is ready, load the first window. Similarly, app can be used to perform other actions on various events. For example it can be used to perform some action right before the application closes and so on. Let us use the same application we used before and modify it slightly to create a temperature converter application. First let us install Bootstrap with the following command: Copy the following code into src/index.html: The above code does the following: The 2 functions which do the temperature conversion are present in renderer.js. Create a file called renderer.js inside src. Copy the following code into it: The celciusToFahrenheit() function reads the value in the Celcius text box, converts it to Fahrenheit, and writes the new temperature into the Fahrenheit text box. The fahrenheitToCelcius() function does the exact opposite of this. Run the application using the following command: This should display the following window. Try it out with different values. The command to package the application is: This command will take some time to run. Once it finishes check the out folder within the project folder. I tested this in a Windows machine. This creates a folder called simple-desktop-app-electronjs-win32-x64 inside the out folder So in the out/simple-desktop-app-electronjs-win32-x64 folder, the command creates an .exe file for this application. Clicking on the exe file automatically starts the desktop application. The folder name simple-desktop-app-electronjs-win32-x64 can be broken down as appname-platform-architecture where When you run this command without any parameters, by default it packages for the platform which you are using for development. Let’s say you want to package for a different platform and architecture. Then you can use the following syntax: For example, in order to package for linux you can use the following command: This will create a folder called simple-desktop-app-electronjs-linux-x64 inside the out folder. In order to create a make file or an installer for the application, use the following command: This command will take some time to run. Once it finishes check the out folder within the project folder. The out/make folder will have a Windows installer for the desktop application. When you run this command without any parameters, by default it creates the installer for the platform which you are using for development. The code for this desktop application is available in my GitHub repo: https://github.com/aditya-sridhar/simple-desktop-app-electronjs You now know how to create desktop applications using HTML, CSS and Javascript. This article covered very basic concepts of Electron and Electron-Forge. To know more about them, you can check out their documentation. I love technology and follow the advancements in the field.

Hiring the right people for your team is essential, and it all starts with how you interview. Here are some of the top things I’ve learned throughout my years both as an interviewer at Asana and Google, and as a hiring manager at Asana. Product Management is fundamentally a white space role, so the skills you need will depend on what what skills you already have and what your company does. It’s best to do this with the people who will be working with the PM and interviewing the PM, so that they’ll all be aligned. PMs do best when the team they’re joining really wants them there. Here are some questions to consider A lot of the processes and specific skills of PMing can be taught to someone with the right potential. It’s easy to teach factual information and tools. Lots of PMs have never worked directly with A/B Testing before, but if they’re strong analytically they can pick it up quickly. They might not know what a Minimum Viable Product is, but if they’re good with prioritization they can figure out how to scope an MVP after you explain it. It would be silly to reject a candidate because they didn’t know a fact that you could teach them in 10 minutes. On the other hand, I don’t think mindsets and what types of information you notice can be picked up quickly on the job. A person could develop these over time if they wanted to, but as a hiring manager I wouldn’t count on them improving quickly if they don’t already have them. On this list I put: customer empathy, awareness of good design, product intuition, product mindset, learning mindset, perseverance, collaborating well with people, effective communication, detail oriented, and grasping complex concepts quickly. In the middle are a bunch of skills that can be honed on the job with experience, but they take time and mentorship. These are skills where you could read a book to pick up the basic tips, but there are so many nuances and complexities that you won’t be able to figure out which tip to apply until you’ve been through it a few times. Or where it’s easy to learn what you *should* do, but it’s scary enough that most people won’t do it until they’ve been burned a few times (like learning to show your work early). On this list I put a lot of the PM processes: working with engs and designers in a sprint cadence, writing specs, leading cross functional meetings, and pulling ideas together into a compelling strategy. If you’ve got experienced PMs eager to mentor, you can build a great team by adding in high potential people who have less PM experience — typically that’s done through hiring new grads, but I think there is a lot of untapped potential in opening roles for people with several years of work experience who want to transition to product management. Some companies like to require a CS degree or MBA, and I’ll admit it’s an easy filtering criteria if your company is overwhelmed with job applicants. However, most product management roles don’t really require deep technical knowledge or a business degree. About half of the PMs at Asana have no technical background, and ALL of them have been quick to learn how to dig into technical issues with their engineering partners. Instead of requiring a CS degree, I look for people who respect engineers and are brave enough to ask questions when they don’t understand something. About a third of the PMs at Asana have an MBA. Many of them say the biggest value they got out of the MBA program was the networking and connections, rather than direct PM skills. If you’re a candidate an MBA is a great path to transition from a different career, but I suspect that employers who require an MBA are missing out. When I first started at Asana we let each person pick whichever questions they wanted to ask. We’d often end up realizing after the interviews that we didn’t really know if they had one of the skills we wanted because no one had asked a question to test that skill. So, we mapped all of our requirements to interview steps to make sure that we’d get enough signal on each. Here’s how we lay out our interview process and some tips for each stage. For senior roles, this is often a quick scan to see if they actually have the experience you need. For junior roles however, there’s a wealth of information you can evaluate at this stage: communication, leadership, product-like experience. Be very careful about unintentional bias — if you require an ivy-league degree you’ll be skipping over a lot of talented folks. At Asana we use a take-home assignment early in the process because it lets us take more risks and consider less-traditional candidates. It gives us great signal on goal-setting, customer focus, product design, and overall judgement. We do sometimes lose candidates who don’t want to do the assignment. If you’re using an assignment think carefully about the ethics of asking for “free work” and try to keep the assignment short and not directly related to your product. Most companies start each interview with “tell me about yourself”, or an abrupt jumping into questions without any introduction. We switched to having the candidate do an intro presentation once to all the interviewers at the start of the day. It gives the candidate a chance to shine and lets the 1:1 interviewers manage their time better. These questions are a little scary to ask because the answers can really go in any direction and sometimes you can get stuck on what follow-up question to ask or how to know if their idea is actually any good or not. To help with this, plan your prompts and follow-up questions ahead of time. Pay attention to time and make sure to steer the interview to touch on all the areas you care about — for example getting them to draw on the whiteboard. One skill we like to test in these questions is “Can you design for someone who is different than yourself”. To get at that, you might find that you need to switch up the question or guide them more strongly for candidates who happen to have past experience — eg. don’t ask “design an alarm clock for the blind” to someone who works on screen reading software. Time for a confession: I hate the traditional analytical questions like “how many pizza restaurants are in the US”. They just terrify me. Instead, I base my analytical questions on real experiences I’ve run into where analytical skill was important, many of which are related to analyzing experiment results. Make sure to test your new analytical questions on PMs you respect, both in and out of your company to make sure they’re not too much of a trick question. A tricky thing about product managers is that it can be very hard to separate out their contributions from the rest of their team. They might have gotten lucky and been put on a great team, rather than really driving the success, or vice versa. With behavioral questions, you can start to really dive in to figure out the scope of their responsibilities and what their unique contributions were. I like to ask a lot about what alternatives they considered and what kinds of resistance they faced to get a fuller picture. Behavioral questions are incredibly helpful for testing for soft skills like collaboration and mindset. I ask directly about how they handled tough situations and have been incredibly impressed at how clear a view I get of what it would be like to work with them. Another trick is to make sure that you push back on at least one idea of theirs during design questions. Ask why they wouldn’t design it a different way and see how open they are to your suggestion. Many PM interview questions can accidentally become trick questions. A candidate thinks you’re testing their analytical skill but actually you were looking for customer focus. These trick questions can cause you to falsely assume a candidate doesn’t have a skill, just because they interpreted your question poorly. One way to address this is to tell them up front what you’re looking for in the question: “I’m trying to get a sense of how you debug problems”. Another way is to carefully frame the type of answer you’re looking for: “What questions would you ask to decide what to do”. A very common trick question I see is that the interviewer wants to know if the candidate will ask questions before jumping into problem solving, so they hide key information in framing the question. This is really tough because people act differently in an interview setting, especially when they are guessing you want them to jump in or are afraid to be rude to the interviewer. Careful framing to make it clear that you’re asking about a hypothetical, rather than directly asking the question can help here: “Imagine I’m a sales person and I ask you how you would build X”. You can also try asking directly like “Have you ever had a time when what people asked for didn’t end up being what they wanted? How did you figure it out?” While you’re interviewing the PM, remember they’re also interviewing you to see if they’d want to work at your company. Treat your candidate experience like a product and look for ways to make it easy and enjoyable. Some of the basics are: reply to candidates in a timely manner throughout the whole process, be polite and attentive during interviews, give them a chance to tell you about themselves, and leave time for them to ask you questions. One tip I’ve learned for selling candidates on the role — first ask them what they’re looking for in their next role, then focus your pitch on the things they care about. Interviewing candidates well is incredibly important and valuable. When you get it right you’re able to recognize talented people who will make a huge contribution to your team. When you get it wrong you accidentally exclude people who would have been great, or hire people who don’t end up working out.

Raspberry Pi Becomes a Member of the RISC-V Foundation,Written by Alasdair Allan," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Alasdair Allan Follow -- 1 Listen Share Earlier today we had a bit of a surprise with the news that Raspberry Pi has joined the RISC-V Foundation as a member. The RISC-V Foundation has a tiered membership structure, with the Silver membership level giving the participating organisation one vote per open position on the Foundation’s board, and allowing them to participate in the Foundation task groups and contribute to the upkeep of the RISC-V ISA. The Silver membership level is the lowest of the ‘corporate’ membership levels offered by the RISC-V Foundation, and carries yearly membership dues of $5,000. Members at this level are not eligible to chair technical committees, or task groups, or stand as candidates for the Foundation’s governing board. If the Raspberry Pi Foundation was seriously considering a near term shift away from Arm to RISC-V I’d expect them to buy into the platform at a level which lent them a bit more control of things. Which probably means that today’s announcement is speculative, or tactical, rather than strategic. So, despite the rampant speculation that this move is going to lead to, I rather think that we aren’t looking at a RISC-V-based Raspberry Pi. At least not yet..? However we recently saw the release of the “final iteration” of the classic Raspberry Pi platform, with the release of the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ in March last year, followed by the release of the Model A+ in November. “…the 3+ platform is the final iteration of the ‘classic’ Raspberry Pi: whatever we do next will of necessity be less of an evolution, because it will need new core silicon, on a new process node, with new memory technology. So 3A+ is about closing things out in style.” Which means that whatever comes next isn’t going to look like the Raspberry Pis we’ve come to know. Until now, every Raspberry Pi has shared hardware compatibility with the original Raspberry Pi released back in 2012, and that’s going to change. There’s been idle speculation about what a RISC-V-based Raspberry Pi might look like for several years. But the last year has seen RISC-V take off in a more serious way with the arrival of the SiFive Freedom U500, a 64-bit Linux-capable chip, running at 1.5GHz. However with the HiFive Unleashed, the first board based around the new chip, costing just under $1,000 we’re hardly in Raspberry Pi territory just yet. Especially as the performance is quite slow compared to similar Arm-based processors. There’s also the long association between Raspberry Pi and Broadcom to consider, and the current lack of good GPU options for the RISC-V platform. The idea that the next Raspberry Pi would have worse graphics performance than the current model isn’t realistic. No doubt we’ll hear more about the announcement directly from Raspberry Pi given time, but despite what you might read elsewhere I don’t think we’re looking at a RISC-V-based Raspberry Pi. But I wouldn’t rule it out entirely. Like the long anticipated move by Apple to switch their MacBook line from x86 Intel chips to a lower-powered, and more battery friendly, Arm-based replacement, a RISC-V-based Raspberry Pi isn’t a totally crazy idea. Indeed, in the long run, it might even be an obvious one? Update: Eben Upton commented that, “…this isn’t a product announcement. There’s a lot of exciting work going on in the RISC-V community at the moment. We believe that instruction-set diversity is important, and that open, free instruction set architectures are an important enabler for innovation. Our impression is that the hardware side of things is going pretty well. We think we can contribute on the software side, which is important if RISC-V is going to become a viable alternative for desktop general-purpose computing. By ‘software,’ we mean some subset of toolchain, kernel, user land, SIMD fast paths, JITs. We will be soliciting proposals for small projects in these areas.” -- -- 1 Scientist, Author, Hacker, Maker, and Journalist.

We’ve Married Technology and Divorced Each Other,"When our devices are the center of our world, the people in our lives can’t be,Written by Jennifer Sartore Hulst"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Jennifer Sartore Hulst Follow -- 21 Share It is early in the morning and my alarm has just gone off. I roll over, my eyes not yet open, and reach for my devoted companion—my iPhone. It has laid quietly beside me on the nightstand all night. I am so thankful for its silence, having just ended a relationship with someone whose snores kept me up all night. With my phone, I turn on “do not disturb” and, bless its sweet battery, it doesn’t. I stumble downstairs with my dogs in tow to let them out to do their morning business. “Alexa, turn lights on,” I say. She does. I stand at the counter where my iPad sits charging, and I visit with friends on Facebook, check my Medium stats, and peek at posts on Instagram and Twitter. I do all this while my Ninja brews my coffee, which was set on delay the night before. I used to live with a guy who made my coffee for me in the morning, and I loved him for it. He also would send me songs he thought I would like or that made him think of me. Now my Apple Music subscription or Pandora compiles playlists for me. To figure out what to have for dinner, I jump on my phone to look up a nearby restaurant or a recipe for the ingredients I have on hand. If I need inspiration for my writing, I pop on Pinterest and browse funny and inspirational memes as my muse. When I need entertainment, Netflix knows what I have watched before and what I should watch next. And so it goes, day after day, my dance with my devices meeting all my demands on a whim. Having just ended a 10-year relationship, I am often asked, “Are you lonely?” My answer? “No.” And the reason, I suspect, is that I am in a very committed relationship with technology that seems to have left me needing people less. But I don’t know if that’s for the best. Instead of our devices being a distraction from our relationships, our relationships seem to be a distraction from our devices. -- -- 21 Honest writing about the ""spectrum"" of life, love, and parenting two teens (one with autism).

Is Azure Profitable?,Written by Mitchel Lewis," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Mitchel Lewis Follow HackerNoon.com -- Listen Share No one wants to buy into faltering products that are here today and gone tomorrow and the same is true of businesses with regard to their IT infrastructure. Given the productivity dependencies, a traditionally slow rate of return, and steep financial burden of IT infrastructure, CTOs and the like around the world often look to key performance indicators (KPI) including revenue, profitability, customer counts, and so forth, much like a prospective shareholder, in order to anticipate the viability of infrastructure as a service (IaaS) platforms such as AWS and Azure prior to making long-term investments in them. For example, if a service provider is breaking close to even or operating at a loss after 8 years, this could be indicative of operational inefficiencies, architectural oversights, and looming changes which increase the likelihood of costly outages. All of which may also highlight the possibility of rate hikes down the road or that the platform in question may not be standing up to the test of time. But if revenue and profit are on point, this is indicative of long-term stability and much less risk. Comparatively, it is like being given the choice of paddle boarding on a calm summer morning or in the middle of a winter snow storm. Needless to say, you can tell a lot about a solution by measuring its profitability. This is why common frontrunners such as Amazon, Apple, and Google are not bashful about disclosing individual revenue, profit, and user counts of their products. But this is also why the competition behind them tends to get creative rather than simply reporting on the same metrics. And when considering the lengths that Microsoft goes though in order to suppress the individual merits of Azure, I am forced to question just how profitable Azure truly is. Before anything else though, it’s worth highlighting that any refresher course focused on lying with statistics would remind you that omission is by far the easiest way to lie with them. Along with shying away from helpful metrics while promenading with misleading and less valuable metrics instead, essentially leveraging data like an octopus jetting its ink, their application in unison is a formidable and proven recipe for statistical gaslighting that companies behind the frontrunner of their industry love to resort to. Put simply, some businesses choose to plea ignorant and resort to diversionary tactics rather than throwing it on the table so to speak and shining themselves in a negative light with the truth; Microsoft is no exception to this. Apple is also guilty of this as of late. As mentioned before and as the #1 cloud infrastructure provider, Amazon happily reports on the individual merits of AWS by posting revenue, profit, and user counts. Why hide being the best? As the #2 cloud infrastructure provider though, Microsoft opts to bundle Azure’s earnings into a container called Intelligent Cloud which averages Azure’s revenue, profits, and losses with legacy server software such as Windows and SQL Server, Active Directory, Hyper-V and so on, making it impossible to compare the two platforms on equal ground. Azure reports total users but not revenue or profit outside of the Intelligent cloud (crutch?). Meanwhile, LinkedIn reports revenue, profit, and total users while omitting monthly usership statistics such as monthly active users (MAU). Although it’s Microsoft policy not to report on helpful metrics such as MAU, hence why LinkedIn no longer reports it, they seem to have no problem reporting it for Azure AD, Office 365, Windows, Edge, Cortana, Bing, Skype (ooops now they don’t), XBox, Minecraft, and other services that perpetuate the narrative of having a strong foothold in their market. With the above in mind, you can see how Microsoft seems to flop their policies tactically, but you can also see a clear trend of omissions being a tell just the same while seemingly trying to mask them with arbitrary policies. Sometimes not to speak is to speak with statistics and omitting data along with creative bundling tactics which Microsoft is leveraging at present are not exceptions to this, but the billion-dollar standard. Although they claim to be changed now, they still have the same general council, Brad Smith, that they’ve had since their laughable antitrust days, and we can also see Microsoft putting in extra effort into muddying the waters so to speak with run rates, obscure metrics, massive marketing overspending rather than simply presenting their data; as they have done historically. However, we can still speculate by giving Azure the benefit of the doubt and simply assume that it is solely responsible for all of the Intelligent Cloud’s revenue in FY18 Q4, which was $9,606,000,000, so that we can have a look at Azure’s average revenue per account (ARPA) on its best hypothetical day and compare it to AWS. While we’re at it, let’s also assume that Azure has 13 million accounts rather than their 12.8 million just to account for growth since this data is over a year old. So let’s take $9,606,000,000/13 million accounts = $738.92 average revenue per account for their latest quarter. Not bad. Good job Hypothetical Azure. AWS, on the other hand, has reported a paltry 1 million accounts subscribing to it at the moment while only generating 6.68 billion in revenue, 2.1 billion of which was profit, in FY18 Q3. So we can take $6,680,000,000/1 million accounts = $6,680 average revenue per account for their latest quarter. For the sake of comparison, we can then divide AWS’s ARPA by Azure’s ARPA ($6,680/$738.92) which shows us that AWS is monetizing its accounts 9.04x more effectively than Azure is. Also and if AWS could maintain this ARPA with Azure’s account-base (6,680*13,000,000), then it would be generating $86,840,000,000 in revenue per quarter. 😳 AWS being 31.4% efficient (profit/revenue) while being more 9.04x more efficient than Azure when measured by its ARPA also indicates that Azure efficiency could be as low as 3.5% or $359,320,000 in Q4 which in itself would easily rationalize bundling it into a container such as the intelligent cloud comprised of more efficient products. This would also mean that Azure could be generating could be generating as little as $27.64 average profit per account compared to the $2,100 average profit per account that AWS is seeing at present which is still 76x more than Azure; when it is given a significant benefit of the doubt. These differences only become greater if Azure represented half of the intelligent cloud’s revenue at $4.8 billion though. If that were the case, then they would be making averaging $369.23 in revenue per account and netting anywhere in between $163 million on the low end to $1.5 billion in profit if they’re as efficient as Amazon this quarter. If accurate, this would also show AWS to be as much as 18x more efficient than Azure from the perspective of ARPA. But I digress. In summary, when a data-driven technology company as equipped as Microsoft turns their pockets inside out instead of posting basic KPIs such as itemized profits or MAU while reporting on metrics that no one asked for instead with regard to a service that’s been in production for 8 years now, it is usually a consequence of these KPIs being contradictory of the narrative that they’re selling, not because they are not readily available. In lieu of these metrics and even when giving Azure the benefit of the doubt and compared to AWS as done above, there appears to be more disparity between AWS and Azure than Microsoft would like us to believe after being in production for 8 years. Azure may indeed be profitable, but when considering the disparity in operational efficiency between AWS and Azure and the exhaustive effort that Microsoft makes towards suppressing its individual performance metrics, I am given no option but to ask how profitable Azure is or whether it is profitable at all. -- -- HackerNoon.com Engineer, Farmer, and Hellion Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*x45-4zLwu1zEqfsNB5Daug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*CJe3891yB1A1mzMdqemkdg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/0*jKDfFM_KZ9lUC7Dl', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*x45-4zLwu1zEqfsNB5Daug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*CJe3891yB1A1mzMdqemkdg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*vKIJctt3OTQA2Etw', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*x45-4zLwu1zEqfsNB5Daug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*hZoX1Q_rp9FyYwPJ4FlaUg@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*TTIl4oynrJyfIkLbC6fumA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*I7hSQEbAX39HswwARzgQVA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*blT0wi3FBRI4UTOl09XMWw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*Xw4eYjndscpjFyom', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*x45-4zLwu1zEqfsNB5Daug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*4_GghEnIlF5xV8ra', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*HwhGJJm9oaoyXnrCYPIXgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/0*r4yjMpEmqzHCUvWC.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*bv2KUVNLi2sFNjBTdoBmWw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/0*zsngbTOmFCy6sUCx.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*gzCeWxDtGmD23QR5', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*di4WDrnS1F6_p9GWnxvPmg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PzJLbFrFtNkqPsxielO8zA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*swd_PY6vTCyPnsgBYoFZfA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*8sSAHftNwd_RNJ3k4VA0pA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*uNyD4yNMH-DnOel1wzxOOA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*Lav4bN6eWuPMxCkee16ThQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*RUtnaV9XF1xtfYj9Pjit-w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*cXLZMOIfUch3dsJv', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*ERI7KvS2K-EB3BFr.']",4-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@wtfmitchel?source=post_page-----3531a14f6233--------------------------------,94,6 min read
Read with purpose: how to better understand and retain what you read,"Written by Aytekin Tank,The modern-day reader"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Aytekin Tank Follow The Startup -- 5 Share “One trouble with developing speed reading skills is that by the time you realize a book is boring you’ve already finished it.” — Franklin P. Jones I’m a proud book nerd. But I’m not a speed reader. Far from it. Reading is one of my favorite pastimes. I do it whenever I get the chance: I read on my phone, listen to audiobooks, scan newspapers, and swipe through pages on my Kindle. I read on the subway, over breakfast, and before I fall asleep. People talk a lot about reading these days — how to read 100 books per year, or how to read 300% faster in just 20 minutes. The overall message: more is better. But before you download the latest speed reading app or purchase a dozen new books on Amazon, let’s consider: why are we reading in the first place? If you’re trying to whiz through as many books as possible, then speed read away. But if your goal is to learn something and truly savor a good book, then it might be time to pump the brakes and focus on reading comprehension. -- -- 5 The Startup Founder and CEO of www.jotform.com || Bestselling author of Automate Your Busywork.

Having fun with your Twitter using Python!,Written by Akshay Balakrishnan," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Akshay Balakrishnan Follow Towards Data Science -- 1 Listen Share Have I grabbed your attention with this clickbaity title? I hope so, anyway. Today, I am just going to show a few things here. One, the amazing ability to crunch and derive a lot of information from your Twitter profile and how you can use it to improve or boost your online presence. Secondly, to showcase some powerful Python libraries which can be used to get lots of things done. So let’s just jump into it! Why Twitter? Recently I have been on a tweeting spree, because it’s vacation time for me and I have nothing better to do. So I notice Twitter, in addition to letting me know how many likes and retweets I get for each tweet, tell me about something called impressions and engagements. Engagements: the total number of times a user interacted with the tweets you sent during the selected date range. Interactions include retweets, replies, follows, likes and clicks on links, cards, hashtags, embedded media, username, profile photo or tweet expansion. Impressions: the number of impressions on a tweet sent in the selected date range. An impression is the number of times a tweet appears to users in either their timeline or search results. Unlike Facebook (which does offer great analytics and information for Facebook pages to be fair), Instagram and other social media, it is easier for me to get a treasure of data from my own profile. This doesn’t even take into account the powerful Twitter API which you can utilize to get insight on other’s tweets! You may ask, where is all of this data you speak of? The powerful Twitter Analytics- how I got my data! As those who have tried to use tweets for purposes like sentiment analysis and all know, tweets are a really useful source of data to perform manipulation and extract information out of. The most obvious, like I have mentioned before, is sentiment analysis- trying to determine whether a tweet is positive in nature, or negative, or just neutral in nature. It is clear from the large traffic on the site, the amount of people who actively tweet daily, and the fact that they make their tweets available in the public domain and can be pulled (you can actually make your profile private but very few do) that enable people to use these tweets to understand many things. By utilizing Twitter’s API allows you to do queries like pulling every tweet about a certain topic within a time frame, or pull a certain user’s non-retweeted tweets. There are lots of ways of getting the tweets in this data extraction phase. You can utilize the tweets present in the NLTK library. You can also use the Twitter API to extract tweets, but I want to make this phase as less of a hassle. So I decided to just analyze my own tweets, which I can extract very quickly because Twitter is very nice to us. So first let’s see where Twitter has stored this information nicely for you! First go to the Analytics section under the menu as shown: It redirects you to a special page which shows a lot of information already. Right off the top it provides what you have been doing over the last 28 days and how your activity is compared to the 28 days preceding the present time period taken into consideration: As you can see they also provide information for each month, and your top tweets, top mentions as well as a summary of information for the month. You can also check how your tweets have fared, as well as graphs of how your tweets are doing: Now, how do we extract information from this in a way that we can process it using your usual Python tools? Thankfully Twitter has this thing called ‘export data’ which conveniently packages all of this data in a nice CSV file and parcels it to your computer, where you are free to open the box and do what you wish! Click on the Export data button you see there, it will take all the tweets over the time frame you wish to analyze and send it to you as a CSV file. Now it will arrive in such a manner: Note that there are a lot of parameters or columns which are not visible here like no of likes, retweets, engagement rate, and so on. But the point is that for many activities, getting a good dataset is a challenge, but Twitter has given us such neat and organised data for us to use. So props to Twitter on that front! Let’s bring Python into this! I would be lying if I said if I am some sort of expert:(spoiler, I am not!). But I will just do a couple of things here, which shows anyone can actually do something with the tweets we have from my profile (do try with your own profile too, but make sure you do have enough tweets to analyse!). One thing is I am just going to see the kind of tweets I am sending out, whether they are positive, negative or neutral using a Python library called textblob. The other thing I will do is see what words I use very frequently and are prominent in my tweets. To add a bit of fun for the same, I can visually represent the results in a cool manner using something called ‘word cloud’. You shall see at the end why I am excited about this. So let’s get started! Prerequisites: I have used Spyder (Anaconda) to write my scripts here, but you can always use the Python shell itself or write the code and run the file (I am using Python3 in all examples here, because why not). You will also need a few libraries to get started (don’t mind the definitions, they are mostly documentation based pointers: a. textblob: TextBlob is a Python (2 and 3) library for processing textual data. It provides a simple API for diving into common natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, and more. b. matplotlib:Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shells, the Jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits. c. pandas: pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language. d. wordcloud:As the name suggests, you can create a cloud of names, with the more used words being highlighted more. For Ubuntu users you can use pip or pip3 to install all these Python packages, which is what I did: (package-name substituted with the relevant package) Sentiment Analysis Time! It’s not even that hard anymore to set up your own program to do this! With the tweets being arranged neatly, all I had to change from the original file was change the column under the Tweets section to add a underscore between the two words (Tweet_text) to avoid having errors with the space in the program. Import the required libraries: Now, import the file you need which should be in the same folder as the Python file you are writing into, using the read_csv function provided by pandas to read it into a variable called df. You can use different encoding schemes. Finally, this is where the WordCloud part comes into play: Feel free to explore all the parameters of the WordCloud function and tweak it as per your wish. Finally let’s display this as output, by using the matplotlib library: This is what I got when I saved this file and ran it on Python: Admittedly, not the best background color, but you can see a lot of words highlighted with different fonts. Feel free to analyse my personality from the words I use in my tweets. Although I will just say words like ‘joelvzach’, ‘picklehari’, ‘pallavibiriyani’ and ‘guyandtheworld’ are all Twitter handles :) Playing with sentiment analysis I am not going to take too much time here, because I am a noob at this just like y’all. But its not that hard to get started, again due to the great work done by programmers in developing efficient libraries which have made it easier to get started with this. All you need to do is this: And you get this output: So these are the tweets I have, as well as the rating of my tweets from -1 (most negative) to 1 (most positive) with regards to my sentiment. It also shows how subjective my statements are too from a scale of 0 to 1. You must be thinking and sitting here, Natural Language Processing? Pfft. I could do that. But here’s the catch: We just played with it on a very high level and abstract manner. Did we consider how we calculate the sentiment or subjectivity of a tweet? What algorithm did we use to go through the text? And so on. This is the marvel of the textblob library. If you want to go deeper into this, I am not adding this to the article, but do check this article as part of the textblob documentation which tells us how the function works and how it utilizes the Naive-Bayes algorithm for sentiment analysis. This concludes my short article providing a sneak peek into what I have been upto lately (no good, as it is clear). Do check out my Twitter (since I have shown a lot of it) and catch me there as I continue tweeting, because why not, right? Code here. Also thanks to the documentation of all the libraries used as well as GeeksForGeeks for providing me good material to make this article happen. Thank you for reading this to the end! -- -- 1 Towards Data Science i write stuff.

Defend from hackers using computer networking fundamentals,"Written by Douglas Rocha,OSI Model,Layer 1: The Physical Layer,Layer 2: The Data Link Layer,Layer 3: The Network Layer,Layer 4: The Transport Layer,Layer 5: The Session Layer,Layer 6: The Presentation Layer,Layer 7: The Application Layer,References"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Douglas Rocha Follow -- 2 Listen Share As developers, we all know the importance of computer networking for security purposes, but it is such a dense topic, full of complexities and acronyms that scare us and we prefer to leave most of that work to the DevOps team. The objective of this article is to change this paradigm and enlighten developers and IT specialists to look at computer networking with a different mindset. We will dive into the OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) and explain how each layer works and how we can attack and protect them after giving a brief overview of each of them. Computer networking is a hard topic because it not only deals with connecting two or more computers logically but also with the electrical engineering part of how will information travel consistently on physical mediums with the best throughput as possible. After this engineering part, we have to deal with topics such as routing, in other words, how to guarantee that information will travel from computer A to computer B. But what information is getting from A to B? A list of 0s and 1s? Can I transform this data such that I can work with it in a friendlier way with my modern programming languages? The same questions were the ones asked by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) on the late 1970s. There were efforts from many enterprises to build computer networks, and each one of them had different protocols and technologies, some of those were not compatible with others and required lots of integration effort. The Open System Interconnection Model, OSI Model for short, was created as an abstract model consisting of 7 layers, each one of them dealt with different aspects of systems interconnection. Why on earth is that so important? Because when we approach computer networking with offensive hacking in mind, we tend to scan each and every one of those layers looking for vulnerabilities, and that mindset should be the same when we defend. Without further ado, let’s embrace those layers and describe each one of them. The physical layer is “responsible for the transmission and reception of unstructured raw data between a device and a physical medium [1]”. That means that it not only deals with where the information will travel, but how we can increase throughput and efficiency, reduce noise and guarantee consistency. In other words, this layer deals with wires, fibre, radio signal and all the things an electrical engineer love. The main tools in this layer apart from the material engineering theory that explains how each medium acts upon the signal, are the concepts of signal and systems which include noise calculations (e.g. Johnson-Nyquist theorem, Shannon-Hartley theorem), modulation and multiplexing. EavesdroppingThis is the act of listening stealthily to information without the consent from data stakeholders. This means that if an attacker is able to include a device that sniffs the electrical impulses in a cable or radio frequency from wireless transmissions, he might be able to know more than you want him to know. The best way to protect against this kind of attack is by only sending encrypted information and to protect your cables from physical contact by strangers. LockpickingI know, it might sound absurd to refer to locks when dealing with computer networks, but since we are talking about the physical layer, the only way a hacker can access your system is with physical access. That means he could cut your wires and destroy your switches if he got access to where you store your network components. How to protect? Good physical protection: fences, perimeter intrusion detection and assessment systems (PIDAS), Closed-circuit television (CCTV), good quality locks, identification and authorization devices like finger scan systems and security guards. A great way to think about this is to think of the 3 D’s when planning: Deter, Delay and Detect [2]. Access Card CloningJust like lockpicking, access card clones are a threat to security. If the attacker is able to steal your card, retrieve and tamper the information, he might gain access to places he should have not. The solution to this problem is to use smart card security. Smart cards [3] are able to identify when data is being tampered and stop working once and for all. Though it may sound great, you have to make sure you are always with the latest technologies as hackers keep improving their abilities and tools as not to get caught. Tempest HackingThough still very hi-tech and uncommon unless you are the NSA, tempest hacking is a researched type of vulnerability that transforms signal emanation, such as screens radiation, into intelligible data. That means that people can know what you are seeing on your screen if they are able to add a receiver in your room. Below is an example of tempest hacking in action in a Security and Cryptography lab in Switzerland [4]: Once we have the aspects of our physical layer defined, we have to analyse how connections point-to-point will work. The data link layer is responsible for managing how a connection from a node A to another node B works. The data link layer is also responsible for double-checking whether the physical layer sent information correctly (LLC) and for establishing and terminating connections between two nodes (MAC). The most known component of the data link layer is the Medium Access Control protocol, or for short, the MAC protocol. This protocol is a set of rules that define how computers get access to the data and permission to transmit it. One of the components of this protocol is the MAC address, which is a globally unique identifier that is the main piece for defining the communication between nodes in a network, it works as a guarantee that the two nodes that are being linked are who they should be. MAC SpoofingAs we read previously, the MAC address is a globally unique identifier, but many drivers allow the MAC address to be spoofed such that you become somebody else. MAC spoofing is a vulnerability that cannot be prevented and it is advised to enterprises to use methods with authentication mechanisms, such as 802.1x with EAP-TLS. The reason for that is that MAC addresses do not guarantee authentication safety and by using strategies such as EAP-TLS we are allowed to use certificates and do this process of authentication with cryptography included. CAM OverflowSwitches operate internally by building a reference table of MAC addresses so that they can know to which ports they should forward the frames to. This reference table is called “content addressable memory table” and is the target of a common overflow technique. In this type of overflow exploit, hackers may connect to one or more switch ports and mimic thousands of random MAC address until the capacity of the CAM table is filled and consequently, it starts to flood all traffic to all ports of the switch. Some common defence countermeasures are limiting the number of connections to a single port of the switch, packet filtering through an AAA server in 802.1x networks and MAC filtering [5]. Commonly referred to as the IP layer, the network layer is responsible for transmitting information to different networks in variable length data sequences often called “packets”, and it does that by mapping physical addresses (MAC) to logical addresses (IP) in a way that it can route interconnections. The reason why I used the word “interconnections” is to make clear that the main difference between layer 2 and layer 3 is the fact that layer 2 cares about local connections while layer 3 goes beyond that.When referring to interconnections, there should be a clear distinction between local and external IPs. The sole purpose of IP addresses is to guarantee that data can be routed externally and internally, so computers connected to the internet will have both external and internal IP addresses. IP SpoofingAs demonstrated in layer 2 explanation, it is possible to impersonate another computing system by spoofing its MAC address. In the network layer, the corresponding computer identity is the IP address, and the good news is you can trick it as well. We can also apply packet filtering strategies to avoid being fooled by IP spoofing, but it is much better to make use of network protocols that do not rely on IP addresses for authentication, such as IPSec. In IPSec, every computer has a credential, and communications only occur after mutual authentication. Unless the credential is compromised, there is no way a hacker can spoof its IP address. ARP Cache Poisoning / ARP SpoofingThe ARP protocol is a set of components that map physical addresses to logical addresses, and for this job, it requires a reference table called ARP cache, just like the table we’ve mentioned on the CAM overflow example. This attack is a bit different though because the objective is not to overflow, but to control and trick. The attack sends some packets to the router telling he has the MAC address of the victim. After that, he sends equivalent packets to the victim telling his MAC address is the same as the router. Now the ARP cache is poisoned, and both the router and the victim’s machine are fooled, they will redirect all traffic to the hacker’s computer. There are many ways to defend against this though such as using IPSec or any other protocol that works with certificates, smart packet filters and using VPN tunnels. Now that we are able to transfer data to different networks, we should have some type of guarantee whether data that is travelling from one place to another is consistent and respects the maximum size of packages that the receiver accepts. The transport layer acts as a “management control”, and it does that with two main flavours: Transfer Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). The first always check after sending packages whether information arrived correctly, while the latter doesn’t, which makes TCP more reliable and UDP faster. Port Scanning / OS FingerprintingAlthough not real vulnerabilities, both techniques are extensively used by hackers before exploiting their victims. Fingerprinting is a mandatory step before attacking victims because it is the only way to understand what kind of environment they are dealing with, and that means not only what kind of exploits they will find, but what kind of logs they can leave behind. The best way to defend against reconnaissance is by configuring firewalls and access control lists correctly. Packet CraftingAfter understanding how systems in a network manage the flow of information, a more knowledgeable hacker can craft packets to try to overflow layer 4 management system. Since it is very dependent on the deployed systems, there is no single solution to the problem, unfortunately. The session layer is responsible for all the traffic control in a node, which means all connections that are initiated and terminated are done here. Its name, session, has to do with the fact that it defines connections’ durations. Before starting connections, the session layer performs a handshake, an operation that guarantees both endpoints are ready to send and receive data. Whenever connections stop, this layer will decide whether they should be restarted or terminated. Cookie HijackingFor those familiar with the HTTP protocol, there exists a component called “cookie”, which is responsible for storing many session information on client computers. Most modern systems use cookies as the authentication storage unit, which means that all session information is stored there. Since we have hacker intentions in this article, we will apply a technique called “man in the middle”, which is the superset of ARP Spoofing mentioned before, to make sure we will eavesdrop all communication information that travels from the client to the server and vice-versa. Once we do that, we are finally able to hijack the cookie and use it to authenticate on the server impersonating the victim. The best way to protect against most types of session hijack is to use encrypted protocols, in this case, we could have used HTTPS, and we would be safer. There are other types of cookie hijacking, but it is not the intention of this article to describe them all, but to introduce them to a broad public. The presentation layer is a facade that transforms data packets into data formats that can be understood by the next layer. This layer is great when dealing with encryption and compression, as it can encapsulate such logic in an elegant manner that is invisible to the eyes of layer 7. Since it represents a data transformation step, it is the layer with the least possibilities of exploits. Most exploits will have to do with lack of data sanitization or lack of proper encryption. Data PoisoningThe presentation layer deals with data transformation, and it is correct to assume that this mechanism is the main target of “presentation hacking”. Data poisoning is writing characters that during the encoding/decoding process will be transformed into uncontrolled exceptions. In February of last year, a data poisoning exploit was found on many web and mobile platforms, where a single character of Unicode, the Indian Telugu, made web browsers and smartphones crash. Companies fixed it as soon as possible to guarantee users’ safety. The only way to solve problems like this is to use safe code libraries and filter characters (or sequences of characters) that should be accepted by your software. We have finally reached the last component of the OSI model. The application layer allows applications to access the network, identifies communication partners, determines resource availability and sync communications. It provides access to final data to applications. Even though this is the highest level of abstraction in the OSI model, the application layer tends to be the most vulnerable layer, as it is fully dependent on the ways apps and programming languages were developed. The application layer is the one that offers programmers many protocols that are used daily such as HTTP, SMTP, FTP, etc. Most of the vulnerabilities are application specific, but we can mention a few… Buffer OverflowProbably one of the most deadly exploits, the buffer overflow has nothing to do with networking but give hackers unlimited power to victim’s machines. It uses the fact that once a hacker can allocate memory beyond computers stack boundaries, they can send any sequence of assembly commands to be executed. This exploit affects the application layer because it makes apps behave in any desired way, giving the hacker full access to all networking features of the layer. SQL InjectionTo query and modify data on databases, programs send commands to the server. When there are no filters though, attackers can send unwanted commands to make the server behave “better”, such as giving more information than they should. The only way to solve such a problem is to write parameterized queries and to treat inputs to avoid being fooled by smart hackers. This one is all in the hands of good programmers.

How 20th-Century Synthetics Altered the Very Fabric of Us All,"They have become an evolutionary force, altering human biology and the web of life,Written by Aeon Magazine"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Aeon Magazine Follow Aeon Magazine -- 2 Share By Rebecca Altman In September 1938, the fall before the New York World’s Fair opened, a 5,000-year time capsule was planted 50 feet beneath the Flushing Meadows fairgrounds. The capsule was 7.5 feet long, made of Pyrex glass and alloyed copper (called Cupaloy), and shaped like a torpedo — a long, thin metal shaft with a cone-shaped nose. This wasn’t the first example of a time capsule. But it was the first use of the term, although its mastermind, G Edward Pendray, briefly — and, as it turns out, tellingly — had considered calling it a ‘time bomb’ instead. Pendray was the publicist for the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, and his time bomb was a ‘master stroke’ of public relations, a clever scheme to retool Westinghouse’s image as forward-thinking, and to best its rival, General Electric, founded by the showman-scientist Thomas Edison. ‘Our scientists have shifted the atoms in their lattices … [creating] stuffs that nature herself forgot to make,’ wrote Pendray in The Book of Record of the Time Capsule of Cupaloy (1938), his missive to the ‘futurians’ of 6939 CE, the year of the capsule’s intended unearthing. Within, he noted, they would find a light bulb, a safety pin, a slide rule, a telephone, Elizabeth Arden cosmetics, $2.91 in cash, a plastic Mickey Mouse cup, the 14th edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica inscribed onto acetate film, and also 75 samples of the era’s most advanced materials, including technologies such as tungsten filaments, asbestos shingling, and DuPont’s just-invented synthetic fibre, nylon. Millions visited the time capsule, peering by periscope into what Pendray called its ‘immortal well’. On the autumnal equinox of 1940, the month before the fair closed, Westinghouse sponsored a private send-off. Speeches were made. A gong sounded. At high noon, 500 more pounds of hot sealant — a proprietary blend of pitch, mineral oil and a chemical compound called chlorinated diphenyl, known today as polychlorinated biphenyls (or PCBs) — were poured into the well. Westinghouse engineers said that the compound would last for thousands of years.

This is “OK” to learn a new thing, but not good when you need to solve a real task. A task usually involves reaching a goal by overcoming a problem. This post unveils the most important “tip” for all beginner software engineers. First, solve the problem. Then, write the code. — John Johnson In other words, work the solution out on paper in steps. Then start writing the code for it. Don’t get tangled in the code and software design first. Many times I hear beginners and junior software engineers say: “I could follow the tutorial and thought I understood the concept. But when I tried to do a similar thing on my pet project, I could not do it.” This happens for two reasons. First, you lost your train of thought somewhere and could not establish a chain.

8 FinTech and Crypto Predictions for 2019,Written by Henri Arslanian," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Henri Arslanian Follow -- 5 Listen Share It was a big year for FinTech and Crypto in 2018 and the coming year is shaping up to be every bit as exciting. Here are some predictions for 2019: 1. Institutionalization of the Crypto Ecosystem: The Toddler Growing Up This year saw the crypto space grow from a baby to a toddler. Its maturation was driven by the development of best practices by industry associations and by announcements from institutional players such as Goldman Sachs, Nomura, Fidelity and others that they’re launching crypto offerings. Expect more such announcements in 2019 as other institutional players, from exchanges to service providers, decide to announce their crypto initiatives, either by building their own solutions or partnering with or investing in crypto companies. This is a very positive step for the crypto ecosystem, providing a much-needed dose of experience and institutional maturity. The surprises may come from some of the large tech firms who are reported to have been building their blockchain and crypto teams in recent months. 2. More Crypto Regulation, Please! Many regulators around the world are quite knowledgeable about crypto and often don’t get the credit they deserve for their forward-thinking policies. This past year saw many regulators, from Hong Kong and Switzerland to Malta and Gibraltar, issuing proactive guidelines and frameworks for cryptoassets. In 2019 you can expect even more regulators and governments to look at providing the regulatory clarity that the crypto industry both wants and needs. The surprises here may come not from the existing crypto-friendly jurisdictions but from some of the larger and traditionally less nimble jurisdictions. France, for example, is pushing through legislation for ICOs, while in the United States a bipartisan initiative is underway to make the US more competitive as a crypto jurisdiction. 3. Bye Bye ICOs — Hello Security and Stable Tokens With over US$20 billion raised, according to some sources (although the market substantially slowed down in the second half of the year), 2018 was a record year for ICOs. And 2019 will likely be the year of security tokens, which are more akin to traditional securities and are backed by hard assets. For example, for real estate projects, security tokens can provide liquidity by tokenizing large real estate assets and streamlining corporate actions. Stable coins, which are backed 1:1 by fiat currencies, will also play a larger role in 2019. They’re seen as a safe haven for crypto traders looking for stability without leaving the crypto ecosystem, and are also attractive to mainstream users looking for a means of payment or a stable store of value to conduct day-to-day transactions. 4. Virtual Banks to Drive Innovation in 2019? This may be the year of the challenger, or virtual, banks. These digital-only offerings are getting traction in the UK and Europe, with players such as Revolut now reported to have over 2 million clients. But it’s in Asia where we may see their biggest impact. For example, Hong Kong regulators are set to approve, for the first time, new virtual banks that could include digital-only offerings launched not only by traditional banks but also by the large tech firms and FinTech unicorns. This could change the retail and SME banking landscape across Asia, as these new digital offerings can solve real-world problems, including the relatively poor user experience for retail banking consumers or the lack of integration with accounting and other SME-specific software for commercial clients. 5. Financial Health: Meditation for My Brain, Gym for My Body and FinTech for My Wallet! We exercise for our physical health. We meditate for our mental health. But we still don’t actively use FinTech for our financial health — when it’s desperately needed. According to some reports, about 57% of Americans don’t have even US$400 of savings to cover an emergency expense and 43% of Americans have been carrying credit card debt for over two years. This can hopefully start to change in 2019 as financial health comes to the forefront and consumers begin using FinTech solutions, from P2P lending to roboadvisors, to help improve their financial lifestyles. Virtual banks may be the catalyst, as they try to integrate such solutions to try to differentiate their offerings and help with client acquisition. 6. Forget Banks and Their Innovation Teams — Here Come Virtual Banks and Crypto Companies In 2018, some B2B FinTech and RegTech firms stopped working with bank innovation teams, who are often criticized for moving slowly and lacking budget. There is a constant perception that some incumbent banks want to partner with FinTech firms or conduct proof of concepts more as a marketing tool than as a driver of meaningful change within their organizations. In 2019, many of those B2B FinTech and RegTech players may pivot to focus only on crypto companies or virtual banks, where there are no legacy issues, decisions can be made quickly, and regulatory compliance is seen as a competitive advantage rather than a cost centre. 7. Regulators Catalyzing Innovation Global regulatory collaboration is increasing and improving every year, with organizations such as IOSCO having become impressive forums for coordination and sharing. Regulators are now leading by example, spurring innovation in many instances. For example, one regulator-led initiative set to launch in 2019 is the Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN), which aims to include regulators globally, from Canada to Bahrain and Singapore to Australia. Not only does it provide features you would expect, like regulatory cooperation and cross-border engagement, but it also includes initiatives such as cross-border trials that allow companies to test new tech product across multiple jurisdictions. 8. Data Privacy: Power to the Consumer! In 2018, media and public scrutiny of platforms like Facebook or Google — where users give out their data for free to be able to use services or search engines — increased substantially. This may have accelerated the long-term trend towards giving users control of their data and allowing them to monetize it in various ways, including using crypto micro-payments. In addition, we may see pricing variations in the value of data based on uniqueness and specialization; for example, a professional mountain climber or triathlete could command a higher price for his or her data than a person with a standard nine-to-five job.

7 Lessons & 3 Big Questions for the Next 10 Years of Governance,"Written by UNDP Eurasia,A very 21st century kind of failure,Towards new Zones of Experiment,1. BEYOND THE SOCIAL CONTRACT.,2. MORE THAN ONE DEMOCRACY?,3. BUREAUCRATIC REVOLUTION.,Beyond IID2018…to be continued"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in UNDP Eurasia Follow Innovation in the age of the SDGs -- 1 Listen Share Co-authored by Milica Begovic, Joost Beunderman, Indy Johar The intent of putting the Next Generation Governance (#NextGenGov) agenda at the centre of the Istanbul Innovation Days 2018 was to start to explore the future of the world’s governance challenges, and to debate how a new set of models are needed to address a growing ‘relevance gap’ in governance and peacebuilding. Any exploration into the Next Generation of Governance requires us to recognize that in an increasingly multi-polar world, a world where power is increasingly more directly used and the singular rule of law we had ‘hoped’ for is being challenged, the future of governance is not only about the technocratic capacity to make rules (even if they are machine readable rules), but also our ability to construct new social legitimacy for all and by all. In a world where we are facing urgent calamities and deep-running risks like never before, organizations like UNDP are witnessing a growing gap between the incremental progress in practice and a rapidly accelerating set of challenges — whether rampant inequality and its impact on social cohesion, growing ranks of forcefully displaced people, the fragmentation of state agency, rapid depletion of the commons, or the seemingly intractable rise of new forms of violence. This gap — between the emerging reality (strategic risks) and existing practice — is set to exponentially grow unless there is a major rethink of development practice and how we remake governance fit for the 21st century. Earlier, we hypothesized that across the world, our governance models are broken: we are holding on to 19th century models that deny the complexity of the ‘systemocracy’ we live in : a world of massive interdependencies. #NextGenGov therefore is an exploration — the first of many — of the type of experiments that chart a way towards a future in sync with the Sustainable Development Goals. It aims to explore the lessons, challenges and gaps emerging with governance not relegated to a single goal (SDG 16) but as the prerequisite of achieving the SDG agenda as a whole. It could be argued governance is the central failure of the 21st century — sidelined as an inconvenient overhead, governance innovation has seen consistent underinvestment and a lack of attention. Our means of governance and regulation have become relics in an age of growing complexity. New capabilities and trends like rapid real-time data feedback loops, algorithmic decision making, new knowledge of the pathways of injustice and inequality, and the rise of new tools and domains of power are challenging established ways of decision making. Frequently hampered by simplistic notions about the levers of change, awed by networked power dynamics in the private sector and undermined by public sector austerity, many of us seem scared and disoriented in responding to the scale of failure and new needs we are witnessing. Worse still, we seem unable to make the case that ultimately, good governance should not be a means of state control but a means to unleash sustainably the full and fair capacity of all human beings. In this context, the growing strategic risks of our age are making past governance protocols and processes increasingly incoherent and misaligned to the need of both member states and our broader global ecosystems; both real-world precedents and statistically derived probability are collapsing as viable decision-making tools. This incongruity is revealed at different scales and conditions: 1. The existing structures, governance and business models, skills, and institutional cultures are producing solutions that do not fit the new nature of problems they are supposed to be addressing (IPCC’s 1.5 C report and genetically engineered baby in China as most recent proxies of misalignment of current practice and emerging existential threats). 2. Business-as-usual as a method to address the entirely new scale and modality of problems is a recipe for decline and irrelevance (consider ongoing efforts to apply current regulatory paradigms to distributed technologies like blockchain). 3. Governments and investors too are experiencing the lack of coherence between existing solutions and emerging problems, and are therefore eager to restructure their relationship with UNDP and similar organisations. Searching for fresh perspectives, our approach was to hone in on a series of Zones of Experiment — a range of domains that could unlock some of the great transitions the world is facing. We looked at new ways to protect and restore the commons, to actualize the human rights of landless nations, and to prevent conflict and empower civic actors in revealing abuses. We also explored science fiction, arts and culture as seedbeds for imagining alternative economic systems, the role of new technologies in urban governance, and new practices in the way power is organized, manifested and influences decision making. Across these zones of experiment, we are seeing how a new generation of edge practitioners is challenging the status quo, and how their experiments enable us to learn both context-specific and transferable lessons. Together, they point the way to the #NextGenGov agenda as a new approach to strategic innovation (and feedback coming in after the IID2018 indicates the need to explore additional Zones of Experiments with emerging new practices such as governance of digital financial markets and impact of systemic structural issues, such as decline of trust on single point sectors including attitudes towards vaccination). Underlying all these is the double edged sword of rapid technological progress in a multi-polar world that is challenging established ethical certainties. The unexplainable AI is one such manifestation, where the advanced identification of correlation is argued to be sufficient to guide decision-making be judicial or even law enforcement, challenging — even perhaps regressing — us to a pre-scientific age and undermining the basic principles of governance — accountability and equality of treatment (as argued by Jacob Mchangama). As Primavera de Filippi outlined in her keynote speech, new technological capabilities always carry the potential both to disrupt the status quo or conversely reify existing structures of power and inequality. If we want to put the new tools of power in the hands of the many not the few, we need to focus on the governance of the new infrastructures rather than rely on governance by those infrastructures. However, whether in blockchain applications (Primavera’s domain) or elsewhere, it is evident that often we simply don’t know yet what kind of detailed issues, unintended consequences or unexpected feedback loops we might face when applying new technological capabilities. This means experimentation can’t be seen as an add-on but should be at the core of exploring the future and rapid learning about implications of emerging trends. This is not the place to summarize each zone of experiment discussed during the Istanbul Innovation Days. But we can outline a series of shared lessons and implications for the future of governance and peacebuilding. 1. Micro-massive Futures — A series of new micro-massive data, sensing, processing and influencing capabilities (as revealed in the work of Metasub, PulseLab Kampala and Decibel) is enabling state and non-state actors to transcend the tyranny of the statistically aggregated average, and instead focus on the micro, the unique and the predictive — early warnings on looming epidemics or weather-related crop failure, emerging signs of microbial antibiotic resistance, or the compound impacts of pollution on individuals, particularly in disadvantaged populations. The much more fine-grained understanding they enable (whether through big data, social media mining, or specific sampling and real-time blockchain-anchored measurement) creates radical new pathways to harboring and enhancing the public interest. Achieving decent average outcomes (of health, pollution, human development…) has more than ever become obsolete as a goal: the geographically, individually and temporally hyper specific data we can obtain, and the wicked nature of the issues at hand, require new ways of understanding ‘risk’ — and acting on it. This same micro-massive future on the other hand is also weaponizing the capacity to mine data in order to influence outcomes at the societal scale — opening up huge new questions about the meta governance of these new capacities in the first place. This implies a double set of responsibilities: if we can now govern and influence outcomes at the micro-level of the individual and molecular detail, and at the massive scale of societal bias, with at both scales growing capabilities to understand risk and predict possibilities — how do we govern in this new reality in order to use these powers for good? Or conversely how to ensure that the emerging capabilities of new governing realities are not resulting in human rights abuses, discrimination and violence? 2. From control to ennoblement — Where such distributed data generating and analysis capacity comes into its own is through new contracting agreements that change our capacity to manage shared assets. The multi-party contributory contracts, e.g. the blockchain-based agreements at the heart of the Regen Network, show us how the collective inertia around agricultural restoration could be overcome. Crucially, rather than disincentivizing ‘bad behaviours’ through control, such ennobling regulatory systems can now be imagined to incentivize, communicate and verify contributory systems. Equally, this capability is paving ways for entirely new class of governance mechanisms for the commons — including bestowing legal rights on rivers and the Amazon. How do we reimagine governance if such ennoblement and restoration would structurally be our objective? 3. Making the invisible visible — New ways of building the politics of change are continuously emerging. Using mapping, animation, arts and other visualization tools, practitioners like Forensic Architecture and Invisible Dust — and in different ways, Open Knowledge Germany — are empowering citizens and civic groups to reveal issues which for a wide range of reasons tend to remain hidden — whether in the case of state agents committing human rights abuses or pernicious, slow-moving killers like air pollution (which in many case of course equally implicates states in failing to uphold human rights). By involving distributed civic networks and creative professionals from right across traditional disciplines, and by connecting to the aspirations of populations in different ways, such emerging tactics act as a powerful complement to established tools to build the demand for change. 4. Hybrid participatory futures — Getting to a next level of citizen engagement in the transitions we face requires a next generation of platforms that enable engagement with complexity, new technology and alternative imaginings of the future. This is about new settings for deliberation, new ways of extending invitations to take part, and tapping into the creative resources of science fiction and the arts to reimagine social contract and alternative economic systems. Medialab Prado in Madrid, the Edgeryders community, the deliberative citizens’ assemblies in Ireland or, at local scale, RanLab’s deliberative polls across Africa, show in different ways that new settings for participation can engender new cultures of participation cutting across ‘online’ and ‘offline’. Their deep investment in the tactics of convening people enable the creation of new and highly constructive new communities of concern around difficult topics, as well as building legitimacy for bold experimental approaches. This in turn enables the prevention of potential policy failure or the addressing of topics hitherto thought untouchable by established political players. In an era that frequently bemoans the decline of trust in the abstract, such cultural infrastructure rebuilds avenues towards greater trustworthiness across different parties, and an ability to imagine futures unconstrained by current divisions and biases, as the mitigation of risk. As differing platforms have differing biases in terms of who they attract an what behaviors they foster, such participation will always needs to be hybrid — well curated online platforms, temporal gatherings and permanent physical spaces all play a role in building the shared legitimacy for civic innovation. Enabling the participatory co-creation of the future is a fundamental component of the governance architecture in a complex world: we must complement the nudging of people’s behavior (a crucial tactic which has been applied with considerable success) with nurturing human imagination and facilitating deliberation and engagement with evidence. 5. Public goods & rights beyond the state — In an era where about 68 million people are currently stateless and this number is expected to rise significantly in the coming years, we are seeing state players as unable, unwilling or simply absent in the anchoring of fundamental human rights like people’s individual and family identity, and unable to access public goods provided outside the national boundary. The Rohingya project and IRYO show powerful alternatives and lessons for the remaking of public services like healthcare for both refugee populations and other contexts where access to such services is patchy. These positive alternatives are equally matched by more challenges examples of the quasi privatization of justice — where large technology multinationals are already acting something like a judicial system — “one that is secretive, volatile, and often terrifying.’ They also reveal the need and possibility to reimagine not just service provision but also new architectures of governance beyond the nation state — consider the incoherence of applying national laws to growing numbers of stateless people, para-state futures around the world. The fundamental question arises whether the seemingly limitless rise in populations on the move and para state governance could compel us to imagine and construct at a more structural level new domains of service provision potentially disinter-mediated from the state — and whether that might be more than just dire necessity but also an opportunity to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. 6. From Evidence based to Experimentation Driven Policy — In an age of increasing complexity, the danger of traditional evidence based policy leading us by the rear view mirror is evident. Instead, the zones of experiment — whether EcoLogic’s futuristic urban landscapes or the service design innovation shared by Pia Andrews from both New Zealand and New South Wales — show the possibility of a new arc of policy formation: experimentation is used to create new forms of situated intelligence and learning, consisting of both new evidence and new insights to underpin the ongoing and iterative development of policies and programmed. These pathways enable institutions to make sense of changes, (re)formulate intent and execution pathways, and thus co-evolve in an open and collaborative process. Fundamentally this is about recognizing 21st century governance will be structurally different: the new institutional capacity can clearly not be designed in vitro but has to grow in-situ, informed by strategic portfolios of experimental options in order to grow the evidence necessary for policy intervention. 7. Sovereignty 2.0. In an age where a vital commons governance can now also be advanced either by imbuing ecological entities — such as rivers in Columbia and elsewhere — with legal rights or by emerging new sets of capabilities like smart contracts and machine learning — as indicated by Regen Network — could this mean the massive scaling of strategies that imbue new types of bodies with ‘sovereign’ powers and capabilities for e.g. machine-based contracting and fining? If so, and heeding Primavera de Filippi’s warnings, the governance of these infrastructures will be a crucial field of innovation. Whilst even individually these are important new trajectories, when taken together these emerging lessons show how we need to challenge our existing practices at a deeper level. Given the degrees of uncertainty and emergence we face, this implies a call for strategic investment in a broad portfolio of experiments can guide us to the future; fundamentally these are learning options that enable UNDP and its partners to seed and test new ways of governing across different domains. In parallel, #NextGenGov also pointed towards a further set of questions and challenges we face when staring into the future of Governance in a multi-polar tomorrow. In a world of sped-up complexity and change, the social contracts and legitimacy underlying our governance systems are constantly in question, not least because the relevance gaps affecting nearly all players (between needs and capabilities; between promise and delivery; between aspiration and capacity) means that not just trust, but actual trustworthiness is in decline. Across the world, we are seeing broadly two cultural-societal paradigms that underlie potential future social contracts: both of which could be argued as falling. Where individualism is the main tenet, we all too often fail to mainstream and anchor societal innovations that would reduce collective risk, whether vaccination rates or distributed flood prevention strategies. Where the collective is seen to take priority over the individual, the possible inability to accommodate divergence and diversity risks undermining the distributed creativity, energy and drive needed (and available!) to address wicked issues. The challenge we face is to move towards social contracts based on an explicit recognition of interdependence — reaffirming the need for the hybrid participation structures suggested above to provide the distributed fertile ground for this, as well as opening the space for discussions on system governance beyond the human governance. In future Innovation Days and Next Gen Gov experiments we need to transcend natural rights and embrace new sovereignty 2.0: such as sovereignty for rivers, trees and forests, opening the scope for dynamic interactions of such rights frameworks for a new social ecological contract. Irrespective of scale or context, it is clear that no sole actor — whether state, civic sector, corporate or start-up — has the ability to tackle the wicked issues of our time alone. This means that discourses on good governance and democracy fundamentally have to be about the distributed power to co-create society. Clearly this is conditioned both by the openness of institutional infrastructures and by the socio-economic fundamentals that enable or hinder people’s agency. Recognizing democracy as creating the positive freedom of ‘being able to care’ (whether about individual life choices, the craftsmanship of work, and about wider social and planetary interdependencies) implies not just a concern about the trends that reduce such capabilities (such as declining economic growth, growing job insecurity or the disasters that uproot people’s lives) but also a focus on the multitude of avenues that enable such care to be expressed and acted upon. The challenge we face is that in this reality, seeing multiparty parliamentary systems as the sole mechanism for delivering democracy seems increasingly hollow: citizen assemblies and participative, high-frequency accountability & feedback systems are examples of vital complementary mechanisms for the enhancement and preservation of public and shared goods. The examples we have seen are evidence of how they can unlock positive, inclusive new avenues to the future at any scale from the local to the global — in ways that ‘politics’ as usual cannot. In the non-pejorative sense of the word, bureaucracy is at the core of governance. Innovation and experimentation in the realm of our everyday bureaucracy can change the nature and people’s experience of governance and everyday life itself — look no further than Mariana Mazzucato’s work on the role of bureaucracy to create new markets. Just like the 19th century centralized bureaucracies shaped the notion of the modern state, the present ‘boring revolution’ in our capabilities (e.g. around data insight, zero overhead cost of micro transactions and transparent multi-actor contributory contracts) can drive a radical reinvention of the notion of governance and power. This is what is at stake. The challenge we face is evident in the many salutary lessons that IID2018 provided, on how positive outcomes of this process should not be taken for granted. Instead they can only result from clear intent, human-centered design and an approach to strategic innovation that is up to the magnitude of the issues at hand. The IID2018 was an effort to manifest the strategic relevance gap between our rapidly growing needs and risks, and our all-too-slowly developing practice — in this case that of increasingly inadequate global governance models and implications across a range of interdisciplinary policy spaces. If revealing strategic risks and their interrelated nature is about building the demand side for ambitious change — Invisible Dust’s credo of “making the invisible visible” clearly struck a chord — then what comes next has to be a strategic innovation response that goes beyond organizational tweaks or individual responses. After all, in a show-of-hands poll on the first day of IID2018, only 5 people thought the world is on track in achieving Sustainable Development Goals — hardly surprising, given recent news on climate change or the accumulating impact of air pollution on health and learning. Addressing governance failures is at the heart of delivering the SDGs and it will require concerted belief, effort and strategic scale investment. By virtue of its cross-sectoral strategic development role, UNDP has a natural and unique responsibility to focus on addressing the strategic, entangled and systemic governance risks facing us at a national, transnational and global level — and in doing so it needs to act as integrator on a country and transnational levels, whilst recognizing and respecting the necessity of a multipolar yet machine advanced interoperable future — where the notion, means and conceptions of governance are fully reimagined and socially co-created for a 21st century. Practically, this means NextGenGov was just the beginning of investing in and building a strategic portfolio of experiments that enable partners to learn, manage risk, and effect system change, in order to rebuild the (technical, political, informational, financial) capability of states and civic actors for agile, iterative governance that is premised less on building solutions and more about dealing with our new certainty — uncertainty. *Special thanks in developing a part of this blog (strategic relevance gap) go to Luca Gatti of Axilo. -- -- 1 Innovation in the age of the SDGs What we talk about when we talk about development Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*qf8xaYYiNc-nPFKssuxsHA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*WJCM6LGq6c_JLle2aOQyaA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*WJCM6LGq6c_JLle2aOQyaA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*hUNR9fii45Gp7Rtj0NjVAg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*WJCM6LGq6c_JLle2aOQyaA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*ZC0YT9TX4RxyFN7N8hx1dw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*WJCM6LGq6c_JLle2aOQyaA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*xKEdwY550Cf9sUcYBIfuZQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*WWkolte7yKLo7aHv', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*UUb0HMDMuibZuDkkCazeJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*x0FBZgsae1ElzECF0gNKgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*BniKIhT3c54sIEuPtzRQKw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*TQlEMeYwwWc38Wqm7EfCTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*0-N4JrXpZG1KJfIrAutd3A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*OOenjvxqWE1STWWu7JCVLw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*T9N3Et8jNZzkvSptC0W-pQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg']",4-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@undpeurasia?source=post_page-----65bbafacb662--------------------------------,179,16 min read
6 Steps to Create Value from Machine Learning for Your Business,"A strategic roadmap for business executives to operationalize and monetize Machine Learning,Written by Vishal Morde"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Vishal Morde Follow Towards Data Science -- 1 Listen Share A thousand years from now when someone writes the history of the human race, the emergence of machine learning (ML) will be hailed as a significant milestone. ML, a branch of artificial intelligence (AI), enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Today, ML has established itself as the key to unlocking the value from customer data. Netflix’s movie recommendations, Facebook’s ability to spot our faces, Google’s self-driving cars are all early examples of ML-powered solutions. However, ML and AI are still in a nascent stage with the majority of industry leaders still struggling to cut through the hype and set right priorities for their businesses. Given the largely untapped potential of this innovation, the following steps can serve as a strategic roadmap for building ML capabilities that help create tangible value for your business. Step I: Build data fabric for your organization Despite living in a data-driven economy, we do not give data the respect that it deserves. The only time data is considered an asset is when a catastrophic data breach occurs; then it becomes our most valuable possession! Creation of data fabric, an ecosystem that would provide seamless well-governed data integration across the enterprise, is one of the most critical steps for deploying ML solutions. Without an efficient and well-designed data fabric, valuable data will be stuck in silos and never get organized, democratized, and monetized to the fullest extent. Without this foundation, ML would become a ‘garbage-in garbage-out’ exercise leading to dangerously inaccurate decision-making with detrimental customer experience. Step II: Hire the right talent A common ML human capital strategy is to hire ‘unicorn’ data scientists with doctoral degrees, exceptional computer programming skills, extraordinary analytical prowess, and brilliant business acumen. In reality, it is simply impossible to find these mythical creatures! They are called unicorns because they are truly figments of our imagination. At its core, ML is a team sport and a cross-functional team comprising of a domain expert, a statistician, and a data engineer can accomplish much more than three unicorn data scientists put together. Another common occurrence is favoring only one particular algorithm such as Xgboost (extreme gradient boosting algorithm). It is important to hire data scientists who regard these algorithms as tools in the toolkit rather than magic potions to solve any problem instantly. Bringing right external talent on board and creating internal talent pipelines are essential prerequisites for the successful evangelization of ML across the enterprise. Step III: Create a lab environment ML is a scientific field and science happens in a laboratory. Successful and rapid prototyping requires a lab environment with access to all enterprise data assets, state-of-the-art analytic tools, and the ability to run champion-challenger tests. With such a set-up, the cross-functional team can quickly move from defining the business problem to conducting analytic experiments, and ultimately developing a ‘minimum-lovable’ challenger ML model with greater prediction power or deeper consumer insights. A lab environment allows the team to undertake a large number of research initiatives, recover quickly from failed experiments, and ultimately identify the most valuable ML applications for the business. Step IV: Operationalize successful pilots Once the successful pilots are identified, the next logical step is to deploy them in customer-facing business strategies and operations. This is where the rubber hits the road and unfortunately melts very quickly! Using inappropriate technology infrastructure, bad software engineering practices, and lack of model governance turns even a great model into an absolute disaster. The emergence of container platforms has enabled packaging ML tasks into standardized units for development, shipment, and deployment. However, this requires orchestration across different operating systems while maintaining the highest performance standards. This is why the projected demand for data engineers will likely to be much higher than that for data scientists in the near future. Nevertheless, successful deployment and operationalization of few critical ML models will build the necessary momentum for wider deployment across the organization. Step V: Scale up for enterprise-wide adoption Value creation within an organization takes different forms but at the end of the day, it is all about making key business processes better, faster, or cheaper. Every business executive should conduct a comprehensive audit of their key processes and identify potential opportunities for supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms. Once a list of potential applications identified, new initiatives should be prioritized based on the basis of incremental business value and potential customer benefits. However, there are several industry-specific constraints that play a big role in determining the choice of ML algorithms. Once a list of potential applications identified, new initiatives should be prioritized based on the basis of incremental business value and potential customer benefits. However, there are several industry-specific constraints that play a big role in determining the choice of ML algorithm. For instance, consumer finance regulations set a very high threshold on model interpretability; hence the banks need to be very careful before applying black-box methodologies such as artificial neural networks. However, this is an active research area and several open-source projects such as locally interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) are gaining a lot of traction in the industry. Overall it is critical to apply ML within the appropriate business context. “Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful” — George Cox, Father of Modern Statistics Step VI: Drive cultural change Finally, we need an organizational culture that embraces a fundamental shift from classical statistical methods to modern ML methodologies. This transformation is fostered by a ‘continuous learning’ culture where the team is encouraged to embrace their inner ‘geek’ and keep updating their skill-set by learning new programming languages such as R and Python, and open-source big data framework such as Apache Hadoop. Furthermore, executive leadership teams should promote a data-driven decision-making culture via healthy dissemination of data and knowledge across the enterprise. In conclusion, we are witnessing a massive tectonic shift in the business landscape with the emergence and operationalization of ML for creating more predictive models, deeper consumer insights, and better customer experience. Creation and execution of an ML strategic roadmap is the key to unlock significant business value and help develop a long-term competitive advantage for your business. -- -- 1 Towards Data Science Data Science Leader | AI & Machine Learning Expert | Data Evangelist | Lifelong Learner | https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishalmorde/ Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*LBJZXuDRhZsexAMOX_a5EQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*aeldhF1y28aOKao2yKu65Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1500/1*dDbgSgF47ByTEZg7P5chkg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1800/1*QCnu2m13_UbPNYT3VMVfqw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1800/1*t9qdanUnsaW_J6Bu9yY5nA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1800/1*Jy-2_aZ3lYhIp7zDytcKLQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1050/1*4IlTqVcuHZyKcZJodOZu6Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1500/1*VidPRvmFocz_R7HDSVx0ZA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1800/1*inUXUqpo5gQPV2WWxOtbbg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1800/1*aQ3xEMt7A9HICaASrBKh-g.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1800/1*ruSKz2r108HX2C0GXzeAaQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:960/1*t_EC7Ely5ypaG1oRoTWpRA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1500/1*UgiEaKwbq1r18tqUSGm-UA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*LBJZXuDRhZsexAMOX_a5EQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*aeldhF1y28aOKao2yKu65Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*7-MshZ4GPqqPf8Cj22nPjg.gif', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LBJZXuDRhZsexAMOX_a5EQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*c7R2bu7CY73r_55YF6JtsQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LBJZXuDRhZsexAMOX_a5EQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2_Zp0BbOzUetq1E5_EcsIg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LBJZXuDRhZsexAMOX_a5EQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*T5dFp-uVOYQf9sWMipJ2hg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LBJZXuDRhZsexAMOX_a5EQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*mXL20vzpbmtpdqYW', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*DI-giaHOh49jZxZ8k7x6dA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*2PEPQ0LxKFELp2lojVF-lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*_FyD8-JlhRRmfaZnEgCrkA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*vzu3JPzaq2EZKTZNY9BhLA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*lEmL62oZdrOOWIzAAFKiFg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*i2zLIwC9mftamP1dbciCeQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*LHZgwsl0nndfitU2.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*pIMxUWDRoavs7IY7WKioZg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*wd_HmipNaZS3-FWSgXc8WQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*Tgt9nqR426wn7hKCtcrWoQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*pN0q7fJWoIw59mXAz46x3Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/0*bOVFN2_iLTHM5m2c.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*TQlEMeYwwWc38Wqm7EfCTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*0-N4JrXpZG1KJfIrAutd3A.png']",4-Jan-19,https://medium.comhttps://medium.com/@vishalmorde?source=post_page-----dfadef2b7ccb--------------------------------,382,5 min read
Amazfit Bip — O Smartwatch 80/20,Written by Rafael Izzo," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Rafael Izzo Follow -- Share Minha relação com a Xiaomi já é antiga e um dos meus casos de amor mais intensos foi com a MI Band 2. Ela foi protagonista na minha saga pra perder quase 20 quilos em 2017, inclusive contei boa parte dessa saga aqui e aqui. Acontece que no fim de 2017 eu resolvi testar as habilidades aquáticas da Mi Band no mar e constatei duas coisas: 1 — ela realmente é resistente a água, mas 2 — a pulseira sai fácil em ondas fortes. Perdi meu amor na praia. Mas como boa parte do meu desafio estava cumprido, não vi necessidade em comprar outra Mi Band, até porque Money que é bom nóis num have fácil assim. E desse jeito eu passei todo o ano de 2018… com menos exercícios mas tentando manter o controle na alimentação. E assim foi até o começo de dezembro. Numa passeada pela Santa Ifigênia pra comprar os presentes das crianças, eu acabei esbarrando por produtos Xiaomi em várias das lodjinhas do lugar. E entre uma galeria e outra, o flerte foi ficando cada vez mais forte. Eu olhava pra ela, ela olhava pra mim… sem perceber já estava com ela nas mãos, perguntando preço, pechinchando desconto. Como poderia resistir a ela? Ela tinha tudo que minha ex tinha, mas me oferecia ainda mais: tela maior colorida, gps integrado, cara de relógio de verdade. Quando me dei conta, já estávamos casados. Eu e a Amazfit Bip. Analogias românticas a parte, vamos aos fatos. O Amazit Bip é um smartwatch intermediário da linha de vestíveis da Xiaomi. Abaixo dele temos a linha das Mi Bands e acima temos outros relógios mais completos como o Amazfit Pace. Como a minha única experiência com esse tipo de produto tinha sido com a linha inferior, acho que é meio óbvio dizer que estou adorando minha Amazfit Bip. Ela exerce todas as funções que a Mi Band fazia com louvor, então não vou me alongar muito nas coisas básicas como contar passos, monitorar o sono e medir os batimentos cardíacos, pois elas estão bem explicadas nos meus textos anteriores. Agora no caso dos diferenciais, talvez o que realmente faça a diferença seja o gps integrado. Ter gps no celular faz com que você possa sair pra fazer seus exercícios sem precisar levar o celular. Isto se você não for um viciado por música, pois a Amazfit Bip não possui armazenamento interno nem conexões com aplicativos de streaming. Mas de qualquer forma o GPS funciona bem para o que se propõe, ele mede com precisão as distâncias percorridas mas pode apresentar alguns erros na hora de aplicar seu percurso aos mapas, devido a margens de erro na precisão. Ah, e uma outra característica da Mi Band que também existe no Amazfit Bip é a maravilhosa duração da bateria. No meu caso, usando gps dia sim, dia não pra fazer caminhadas e com várias notificações ativadas a bateria está durando em média 15 dias. Nesse ponto a Xiaomi AOMILHA mesmo. Uma outra função que já existia na Mi Band mas que é bem melhor explorada na Amazfit Bip é a questão das notificações. Como o relógio tem uma tela maior e com melhor definição, ao invés de apenas vibrar e mostrar o logo do app notificado, ele consegue mostrar as mensagens recebidas ou mesmo o nome de quem está te ligando. Parece pouco, mas é uma parada muito útil. Querem ver? Hoje em dia muita gente utiliza a famigerada verificação em duas etapas pra aumentar a segurança na hora de entrar nas redes sociais ou e-mails, certo? Então imagina você estar na frente do PC entrando no seu email e ao invés de ter que abrir o celular pra ver o código enviado por SMS você apenas olhar seu relógio. Bom demais, né não meu consagrado? A Amazfit Bip inclusive utiliza o mesmo aplicativo para parear as informações com o celular, o Mi Fit. Lá você consegue visualizar todos os dados de passos, histórico de medição de batimentos cardíacos, e configura de forma básica as notificações, alarmes e watchfaces (a popular carinha do relógio). Um outro detalhe similar ao da Mi Band é o fato de que você pode utilizar outros apps além do app oficial para configurar seu relógio. No caso da minha antiga pulseira, apesar de ter lido diversas recomendações sobre apps de terceiros, nunca vi real necessidade de baixar outros apps além do Mi Fit, mas no caso da Amazfit Bip a coisa já muda de figura. Tem pelo menos 2 apps essenciais pra poder aproveitar ao máximo todas as funções do relógio: Amazfit Bip & Cor Watches — Na própria Amazfit Bip existem alguns modelos de watchfaces que podem ser utilizados, e existem outros poucos modelos dentro do app Mi Fit. Mas se você realmente quiser uma variedade de watchfaces, esse é o app. No momento em que escrevo isso o app possui cerca de 440 watchfaces SÓ EM LINGUA PORTUGUESA. Tem pra todo gosto e a troca é realmente simples e explicada facilmente dentro do próprio app. Amazfit Tools — Este app funciona como um Mi Fit on steroids pois possui basicamente as mesmas funções, mas com um leque de opções muito maior. O maior exemplo de uso do Amazfit Tools acontece na parte das notificações, pois ele amplia E MUITO o leque de apps suportados para notificações e ele também faz com que a leitura das notificações seja mais simplificada, pois se você ativa as mesmas pelo Mi Fit o relógio não reconhece os caracteres especiais como acentos e cedilha. Um outro ponto interessante do app é a capacidade que ele tem de dar funções extras ao botão do relógio. Você pode ativar funções para duplo clique ou até triplo clique. No meu caso eu ativei o duplo clique para pular músicas no spotify, assim evito tirar o celular do bolso quando quero trocar de faixa. Mas essa é só uma entre várias funções disponíveis, tem milhares de opções de automatização e o céu e a sua criatividade são o limite nessa parte. Neste momento vocês devem estar se perguntando (ou deveriam, pelo menos) porque eu coloquei esse título no meu texto se até agora não falei nada sobre 80/20, Pareto etc. A real é que a Amazfit pra mim representa perfeitamente o princípio de Pareto, pois pra mim ela oferece 80% (ou mais) das funções que eu gostaria de ter num relógio inteligente custando (BEEEM MENOS DE) 20% dos smartwatches famosos. Se isso não é um negócio da China, eu não sei o que é.

To Hire or Not to Hire Online AI Grads: That Is the Question,"Written by Synced,online education,Opinions"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Synced Follow SyncedReview -- Listen Share It all started with a tweet from Google Japan Data Project Manager Suzana Ilić: “Yesterday someone (ML, CS PhD, Stanford) said he would not hire a person who is online educated in Machine Learning. Who here agrees and who thinks differently?” The question triggered a long and occasionally heated discussion that spread from Ilić’s twitter across the machine learning community. Typically, candidates for ML research positions are expected to have a strong academic background in CS (computer science), ideally from a respected tech university. Carnegie Mellon University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University, University of California at Berkeley and Tsinghua University are global leaders for ML, and these schools’ grads are heavily targeted by tech giants and startups alike. As Ilić pointed out, “any job description related to ML requires a (technical) degree, in many cases a PhD (and I’m not even talking about research, but engineering). Without a degree, one would probably not even pass the resume screening.” However, with the rapid evolution of ML both in labs and the real world, online courses have emerged as an increasingly popular choice for those interested in the field. The question for Ilić is whether “a formal degree provides something essential that cannot be replaced by online education and if so, what it is?” A tremendous number of online AI education options have appeared in recent years. MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) platforms such as Coursera and Udacity are now wildly popular across the ML community. AI guru Andrew Ng’s Stanford University machine learning course remains the most popular on Coursera, the world-leading online education platform he co-founded in 2012. In 2017, Ng launched Deeplearning.ai, a specialized deep learning education project which so far has attracted over 250,000 enrollments. Ng’s courses are aimed at students or engineers with mathematics and computer science backgrounds. The Deeplearning.ai “AI for Everyone” project meanwhile is designed to help non-technical business professionals such as CEOs, product managers, marketers, designers and financiers better understand AI and what they can do with it. Udacity was also born out of Stanford University, when two instructors began offering their “Introduction to Artificial Intelligence” course to the online public for free. More than 160,000 students in more than 190 countries have since enrolled in Udacity AI courses. Aiming to offer a specific skill set for professionals who wish to bridge the gap between learning and career, Udacity programs are decidedly job-oriented. Udacity has also teamed up with Georgia Tech to offer an online Master´s degree in Computer Science. Kaggle, an online community of data scientists and machine learners, offers Kaggle Learn as a short-form AI educational tool that covers topics such as deep learning, machine learning, Python and so on; to teach “practical data skills you can apply immediately… to become a data scientist or improve your current skills.” Fast.ai meanwhile offers a variety of free courses in coding, software library, research, etc.: “the world needs everyone involved with AI, no matter how unlikely your background.” Courses “covering computing from its fundamentals to fully-deployed, scalable applications” are also available from the Lambda School with no upfront cost. Ilić’s tweet naturally caused concern for the many people studying AI online. For her part, Ilić said she would “absolutely hire someone without a [traditional] degree.” The Founder of fast.ai and former Kaggle President Jeremy Howard agreed, tweeting “I never had a formal technical education” and “I didn’t actually go to any lectures or tutorials. I thought they were a waste of time.” Creator of the Keras open source neural network library François Chollet chimed in: “It’s an antiquated and elitist viewpoint. There are no ‘online’ and ‘offline’ educations, nor ‘formal’ and ‘informal’. The best people are 90%+ self-educated, whether they have a degree from Stanford or not. The value-add of degrees in CS is increasingly marginal.” Lambda School CEO Austen Allred let figures do the talking: “Five $130k+ offers for Lambda School grads this week. None of them had a four-year degree. None of them had prior professional experience. None of them had ever made more than $30k before.” Google AI ML researcher David Ha presented his personal experience: “I was online-educated in Deep Learning. I started from Andrew Ng’s ML MOOC, Stanford tutorials, to Hinton’s MOOC on Neural Networks.” Many on the other side of the debate pointed out that new hires bring risks, and those from established universities can be a safer bet for companies. Twitter ML Engineer Sijun He drew from personal experience: “MOOC still doesn’t provide the same rigor as a formal education yet. i.e., I have taken Andrew Ng’s ML course both in person and on Coursera and the difference is huge. To cater the class to the mass audience, most of the math was taken out and the focus on intuition instead.” He also suggested what matters most is interview performance. The discussion revealed how ML professionals and the AI community in general view the emergence of online education opportunities in the field. In an informal poll in Ilić’s twitter thread, only 18 percent of respondents agreed with the idea of not hiring online grads, while 82 percent disagreed. One thing is certain: As online AI education programs continue to turn out new grads, to hire or not to hire is bound to become an even more controversial topic across industries.

How Netflix Could Eventually Stop Losing Money,Written by Bloomberg," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Bloomberg Follow Bloomberg -- Share By Eric Newcomer While you spent the holidays streaming “Bird Box,” “Black Mirror: Bandersnatch” and/or re-watching “The Office” for the hundredth time, Netflix Inc. was playing out a corporate drama of its own — poaching Activision Blizzard Inc. Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann to be its new CFO. Just before the news emerged, Activision abruptly announced that it would fire Neumann, who had agreed to a provision that barred him from negotiating for a new job until the last six months of his contract. It was a clear sign that Neumann wasn’t willing to pass up a chance to work at Netflix, this era’s preeminent high-flying, money-burning media company. Neumann’s mandate at the company is clear. A Wall Street Journal headline put it this way: “New Netflix CFO to Tackle Cash Flow Conundrum.” Buzzy original thrillers like “Bird Box,” or choose-your-own-adventure gambits like “Bandersnatch” aren’t cheap. And as Netflix’s public profile has climbed, so have its losses. Analysts predict that the company will report about $3 billion in negative cash flow for 2018, up from $2 billion in the previous year. Fans of wildly expensive, high-quality television should hope the company can figure out its balance sheet. -- -- Bloomberg Find more like this at bloomberg.com Help Status About Careers Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*PrqgLL9XHoUR6U2JuQX9_g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*mbG2hAx42XZkwmTVwS2AXQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2880/1*vjOXXSnyZ8uhWY_bZkcxYw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:935/1*anQCDqyqvlPvsA-QK2SH8g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:953/1*pWM0yzwFftQONtLJSXLjDg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:953/1*mUliSDxyIBLKlEGhBg0AFQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:938/1*1HQ-6FIwuoD7Z5Y1ob8GAw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:900/1*qvgMu1gbJgw6fL1dJ-D_Hg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:945/1*4xUxBrCy-ipXDe5gRboGkQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1500/1*xYpdE0KKQfYzFp8aYzN6og.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1500/1*o3EfMTEzPwcS9RRPPiUf5Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:0/5c50caa54067fd622d2f0fac18392213bf92f6e2fae89b691e62bceb40885e74', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*PrqgLL9XHoUR6U2JuQX9_g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*mbG2hAx42XZkwmTVwS2AXQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*DjBSN3VuvMm3MJIyKNxRyQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*PrqgLL9XHoUR6U2JuQX9_g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*nywy2UMGg0UNzMXVj12YJg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*PrqgLL9XHoUR6U2JuQX9_g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*ZcNDLy4pEQB_AixgNWmHjg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*PrqgLL9XHoUR6U2JuQX9_g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*59Jcc-QC43gl1gAIZWxtsg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*PrqgLL9XHoUR6U2JuQX9_g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*4_GghEnIlF5xV8ra', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*HwhGJJm9oaoyXnrCYPIXgg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*TQlEMeYwwWc38Wqm7EfCTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*0-N4JrXpZG1KJfIrAutd3A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*era76EGCwdY2gWSFKutuSw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*AiTJDz5wwQFiUCf_SrBOQA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*zjPggFS8yoRtFbAP9R_3lw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rA5T3ZTDMr3Gh0taL6-CGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*9l0iePJqhp93hXlEupk27A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*3CpH1U4LpX8jcrpOPdGSYQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*vzu3JPzaq2EZKTZNY9BhLA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*lEmL62oZdrOOWIzAAFKiFg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*i2zLIwC9mftamP1dbciCeQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:72:72/0*M8Jq6btD0YsgaRM1', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*rsp22rKwFDjiwwCcUly56Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:72:72/1*PNVLDmurJ5LoCjB9Ovdnpw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*qxwGRoHBIloz8yzftgvpug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*3vJU4sgGd_CmFQFl4wH6-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/0*niQ0sAwUszuyNMyH.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/2*pZPMtIONqtJYi2xHYD_Ivg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*paMoCSacdb0UFe2zMV7R6w.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*veEX4-CiLz5jqUjwWfQo_Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1019/1*5v_U1acnGcAMnvYWncEYYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:30:30/1*LVOq8WJ5EscuX197508AzA.jpeg']",4-Jan-19,https://medium.com/@bloomberg?source=post_page-----5be8b1e4b5ed--------------------------------,441,3 min read
What Bear Market,"Written by Wilson Withiam,Sifting Through the Media Noise,Death of the ICO and the Return of VC Funding,A New Corporate Entrant,So What Now?"," Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Wilson Withiam Follow DappDevs.org -- 4 Listen Share Despite cryptocurrency prices tanking harder than the 2013–2017 Philadelphia 76ers, the quality of blockchain development and innovation is set to see drastic improvement going forward. With the ease of accumulating capital stripped away, entrepreneurs and developers have been forced to focus on building infrastructure (i.e. Lightning Labs, Parity Technologies, etc.) and distinguishing use cases that actually benefit from a decentralized backbone (still limited and widely debated). This approach is exactly what blockchain technology needs right now. The ongoing Bitcoin experiment has shown there is tremendous value in the disintermediation of digital commerce. But decentralized infrastructure comes with implementation challenges such as scalability constraints, transaction latency, and increasing computational costs, all of which hinder adoption. These hurdles don’t even account for the steep learning curve, regulatory inconsistencies, and possible platform token volatility that also stifle research and development enthusiasm at the corporate and user levels. These are limitations that need to be remedied for blockchain technology to start impacting the way we exchange value and conduct business. Without the lure of immediate riches through magic internet money, now is the opportunity for all invested parties, from developers and entrepreneurs to enterprises, to start building quality projects that deliver long-term value. The cryptocurrency market sentiment was as frothy as the prices in 2017, but news outlets have veered too far towards the opposite end of the spectrum last year. Most headlines have zeroed in on the massive price collapse, exit scams, and crypto company layoffs. Naysayers and permabears have crawled out from under their rocks en masse. “Bitcoin is dead” has now been declared 336 times since inception. These reports deserve to be a part of the current narrative, but they fail to tell the whole story. In just the last two years, the overall blockchain job and cryptocurrency markets have grown exponentially by 668% and 613% respectively. ConsenSys, the fast moving blockchain startup out of Brooklyn, NY, alone grew from around 100 to over 1,000 employees in that timeframe. Therefore, the company’s recent layoffs and restructuring of its priorities should be seen more as a natural maturation than an imminent demise. Moreover, the blockchain engineer job market has continued to see steady growth throughout this downturn, ranking as the top new occupation in LinkedIn’s Emerging Jobs Report. And to the Bitcoin skeptics, the Bitcoin blockchain is still supported by over 10,000 nodes and processes ~260,000 transactions per day. Although both measurements are short of their Q1 2018 highs, they are down considerably less than the total network market value in USD (Network Value = Price per Unit x Units Outstanding). Translation: Bitcoin is far from dead. Whether cryptocurrency prices return to their all-time highs is a mystery and, frankly, irrelevant to everyone other than speculators (see: gamblers). The blockchain is still a nascent technology, and there is a large amount of market value available for companies implementing or building business plans around it. This value is estimated to be $3.1 trillion by 2030 according to Gartner Research. With that in mind, more entrants with long-term outlooks focused on use case viability and customer adoption should emerge in an effort to gain market share. I am being somewhat hypocritical here in declaring a new and innovative form of fundraising dead. Who knows — Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) could be ahead of their time and, once the legal dust settles, might become practical source of raising capital. This would at least require an endless amount of regulatory approval, a handful of successful decentralized applications, and a wide scale adoption of token-based economies. It is an uphill battle that is improbable in the short-term, but certainly not impossible down the road. The current market outlook for ICOs is far less optimistic. The funding frenzy that fueled the speculative spike in cryptocurrency prices has since come to a grinding halt. In September 2018, the amount of money raised via ICOs tumbled to $180 million, marking a 93% drop from its peak. [Note: The only outlier in this group is EOS, which raised over $4.1 billion throughout its year-long ICO ending this past June.] The waning interest in ICOs is directly related to the free fall in cryptocurrency prices. Most tokens launched within the last few years are down over 90% in price from all-time highs, including a large percentage well below their ICO price. None of this should be surprising. Token generation and crowd sale contracts can be coded within a few hours. Projects needed nothing more than a fancy landing page and a whitepaper littered with buzzwords to win over retail investors. This led to a litany of failed startups, lost capital, scams, and Ponzi schemes (What ever happened to the BitconnectX ICO?). Most, if not all, of these tokens are unregistered securities and have no reason to hold any sort of monetary value. The purge of these types of blockchain projects is well underway and will continue in the foreseeable future. Last year, ICOs were named as a possible replacement for traditional venture capital when funding blockchain projects. Ironically, the death of the ICO market has given way to an increase in VC backed blockchain startups. Venture capital investments in blockchain and crypto companies grew 316% in 2018 to $2.85 billion. Whether this recent spending spree is due to a fear of missing out (FOMO) or a tactical approach of waiting for the market to mature and valuations to return to orbit is unknown. Regardless, most VC firms bring a substantial amount of experience and knowledge when it comes to evaluating startup teams and business proposals, leading one to assume the quality of businesses receiving funding is considerably greater than ICO backed projects. Many of these VC backed companies may fail, with the latest casualty being Basis. But a more stringent path towards initial success and exposure will provide better insight into what strategies are effective and which approaches need to be reevaluated. While a significant portion of blockchain development and innovation is occurring at the periphery, a number of established and revered companies have recognized the potential for blockchain technology and dedicated resources to winning market share. Overstock.com and Microsoft were two of the first recognizable brands to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. Square has integrated Bitcoin processing onto its payment platform and even received a BitLicense, courtesy of the New York Department of Financial Services, within the last year. IBM has been on the forefront of enterprise blockchain development, with Microsoft and J.P. Morgan starting to establish their presence. Other companies exploring use cases include Maersk, Ernst & Young, AXA Insurance, Walmart, and many more. The most surprising entrant to announce blockchain support in recent weeks is Amazon. It comes as a slight shock after AWS CEO Andy Jassy criticized blockchain technology last year at its annual re:Invent conference. Jassy confidently proclaimed there are no use cases for blockchains beyond a distributed ledger, which limits the technology’s capabilities. He added that AWS would only build technology due to customer demand and not “because we think it is cool.” It was an impressive deflection as AWS partnered with R3 — a blockchain consortium of over 200 members — and integrated its Corda platform onto the AWS marketplace a mere five days later. Jassy, however, was just getting started. The cloud service provider announced its blockchain framework for Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric in April. The following month, AWS partnered with the massive blockchain incubator ConsenSys to collaborate with Kaleido to simplify and accelerate the process of building production-ready DApps. The partnership resulted in the creation of the “Kaleido Marketplace” that launched this past October. Everything came full circle about a month ago when Jassy announced two new blockchain-based AWS offerings, Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB) and Managed Blockchain, at re:Invent 2018. Both of these services require Amazon to act as a trusted intermediary. The irony was not lost on the blockchain community. Nothing angers the crypto-anarchist crowd more than introducing a “trusted” centralized authority to manage what is claimed to be a distributed ledger. And this backlash is not without merit. AWS acting as the sole gatekeeper for these frameworks creates a single point of failure, threatens inclusiveness and user data rights, and reintroduces value exchange inefficiencies. These pain points exhibited by current tech stacks were the driving force behind the discovery of the Bitcoin blockchain. On the surface, it appears that Amazon is living in the past and stunting advancements in the space. The AWS approach is not revolutionary, but its services may help stimulate use-case exploration and blockchain adoption. Ethereum-based applications still suffer from a high developer learning curve and sub-par user experience. And sub-par is a very generous description because I’m biased. AWS now offers almost a Ben & Jerry’s level of platform flavors (25 to be exact) to appeal to developers from various backgrounds. Moreover, the Kaleido Marketplace plug-and-play protocols and tools claim to eliminate “80% of the custom code” needed to build a blockchain project. Therefore, it might be fair to assume that Amazon could interest a wide variety of programmers and entrepreneurs to join the space and try their hand at constructing a DApp. Will Amazon’s custom blockchain services be a long-term success as is? I don’t know. The latest reports have been spelling doom for enterprise or permissioned blockchains, known for dismissing the use of a cryptocurrency, as they are failing to achieve actual adoption. Companies seeking blockchain solutions have come forward saying they see more value in open, permissionless platforms. These same companies are also finding permissioned consortium blockchains difficult to manage without a financial incentive for maintaining a server to secure the network. Regardless, Amazon has the potential to expose numerous developers to the possibilities of the blockchain and bring a wealth of new ideas and innovations into the space. This alone will help push blockchain technology forward, especially in terms of implementation and user experience. The easy ICO money is gone, but there is still plenty of opportunity. Even sports teams like the Philadelphia 76ers manage to work their way back to favorable win-loss records. What fuels reversals like this is years of developing and investing in talent and infrastructure — and, of course, being gifted the opportunity to sign the best athletes leaving college to enter the professional ranks (In the NBA, the teams with the worst records receive the best odds of winning a high pick in the annual NBA draft). Emerging technologies will not likely have the luxury of spectacularly failing year after year while being rewarded with potential top tier talent. Therefore, progress now rests on the backs of those already invested (with either time or money) in the greater blockchain and crypto community. There are a lot of technological questions that need to be answered regarding base layer platform scalability and the potential of second layer solutions. The process, however, is going to require building a supportive infrastructure that extends beyond technological capabilities. These include the economic role cryptocurrencies may play, the business applications that will evolve, and, perhaps most importantly, the future regulatory landscape. While over-exuberance is often dangerous, being overly pessimistic can be as unhealthy and stifle progress. It is safe to assume any industry that sees extraordinary growth is susceptible to sizeable pullback. But this period of consolidation is necessary for future growth and long-term success. It will take an entire community from various areas of expertise to push the boundaries of what is achievable. And the interest lost due to the price crash of cryptocurrencies has only opened the door for new entrants and opportunities. At DappDevs, we have embraced a multi-pronged approach to building the future of value transfer with blockchain technology. Our primary focus is on technical education and bridging the gap between the demand for blockchain professionals and supply of developers with the necessary skills. But with the help of our partners, we are striving to support local blockchain projects, provide an accessible pipeline of exceptional talent, and advocate for positive blockchain legislature. On this final point, three of our leaders are on the Blockchain Working Group (BWG) here in Connecticut. The BWG recently met and voted on providing legal definitions on core blockchain concepts, as well as how to support the development of use cases within our state and local governments.
